All speeds are calibrated airspeeds (CAS) (requirement 4.4 ) and given in knots if not stated otherwise. All other units used are metric (SI units). The weights are given in mass units (kg) but the formulas require force units as input, therefore these are calculated in place wherever they are used. Note: The speeds defined within this document should be used for the placards, speed markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by flight test.

Maximum speed in level flight VH According to flight tests  at maximum weight and maximum continuous power at sea level conditions, the maximum speed in level flight has been determined:  Stall speeds VS, VS0, VS1 These speeds will be verified by flight test according to requirement 4.4.1 .  In order to calculate the stall speed, the maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane as a whole is determined first. The maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane has been calculated starting from the polar curve of the wing profile taken form ref.  (p. 236, Re=2.9E6 flaps retracted  and p.237,  for the flaps in landing configuration, and  in take-off configuration). Considering the horizontal tail balancing force and the lower total wing lift due to wing lift distribution, the total aeroplane lift coefficient has been lowered by 15% with respect to the one of the profile.   Therefore aeroplane lift coefficient is estimated to   and for the landing configuration (since the span extension of the flaps is half of the span of the wing):  Stall speeds have been calculated based on these calculated lift coefficients. The wetted wing area SW is used instead of total wing area S because of a lower lift within the fuselage section of the span. Flaps retracted (take-off configuration):  Flaps extended (landing configuration):  Flaps extended (take-off configuration):  With . The stall speed in landing configuration (flaps fully extended to 40 degrees) is 44 kts. Therefore it is In accordance with CS-LSA.5 . In Take-Off configuration (flaps extended to 20 degrees) the stall speed is 47 kts. (Note: These speeds are estimates. The methods for the estimation can be various. It is important that these estimations are as precise as possible. Flight tests will be used to validate the stall speeds. In case the flight tests show different values, this might have an impact on the speeds used for design and ultimately might impair the compliance to the CS-LSA.5.)  Design manoeuvring speed VA According to requirement 5.2.4.1     Flaps maximum operating speed VF According to requirement 5.2.4.2 , such speed shall be not less than the greater of      and   The speed has been selected as:            This is the maximum flap operating speed for the take-off (at 20 degrees) and landing flap settings at 40 degrees. Flaps maximum extension speed VFE On this aeroplane the maximum flap extension speed is identical to the flap operating speed VF.  This speed is the maximum speed for flaps in take-off and landing configuration. Design cruising speed VC According to requirement 5.2.4.3    may not be less than:  and need not be greater than:  The speed has been selected as:  (Note:  can be selected to be higher than  .) (Note:  and VDF ,VD ,VNE correlate with each other. should be selected to allow for a minimum margin of 22% to VDF in order to be able to satisfy the requirements for the next subchapters.) Design dive speed VD According to requirement 5.2.4.4   For  a higher value than the one above has been chosen:  (Note: ASTM F2245-12d 5.2.4.4  requires an exact value for the dive speed. Indeed, such value should be understood as a minimum value. This will be clarified in the next amendment of the CS-LSA.)  Demonstrated dive speed VDF According to requirement 4.1.1.1  VDF must be less than or equal to VD. In this case VDF is equal to VD:  (Note: In case the demonstrated VDF is lower than VD then VNE needs to be limited accordingly which could have an impact on the selection of VC as well.) Never exceed speed VNE According to requirement 4.1.1.2  the VNE Shall be greater than or equal to:  and  must be less than or equal to:  The speed has been selected as:  Note: If the aircraft is equipped with retractable landing gear then VLO must be determined as well (CS-LSA.15 6.12.2). Altitude The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. In fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)  Manoeuvring and Gust load factors n Summary of limit load factors according to certification specifications and gust requirements. Table 2 – Manoeuvring limit load factors  Gust envelope Gust load factors need to be considered because they can exceed the prescribed maximum load factors at different weights and altitudes. Since gust loads depend on air density and aircraft mass they will be calculated for all twelve cases (sea level and 10000ft=FL100, maximum, minimum flying weight and minimum flying weight with full wing fuel tanks) according to requirement 5.2.3.3  with flaps retracted (requirement 5.2.6.1 ) and fully extended (requirement 5.2.6.2 ) at . The calculation is based on appendix X3 . To calculate the gust loads at altitudes other than at sea level the formula X3.1  is altered to include the density at sea level  as well:  The corresponding weights are defined within . Since the gust loads on the wing and tail have been chosen to be treated together,  is the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane (). (Note: the applicant should provide the method for the calculation of the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane)  Table 3 – Gust load factors V-n Envelope Below a typical flight envelope is shown. This specific one is corresponding to MTOW and FL100. For other design weights the shape of the envelope remains similar, with the difference that the gust lines will change (due to different load factors as per Table 3).

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. Within this document the loads on the wings are determined throughout the whole flight envelope  and for the design weights as determined in  under all loading conditions. The simplified criteria of requirement X.1  have not been used for these calculations. The Loads are calculated using literature methods taken from the documents referenced in chapter 1. The following assumptions are made: Applicable to LSA only; no compressibility effects; conventional configuration (e.g. no tandem aircraft, bi-plane or canard); no pitching moment of the horizontal tail (symmetrical profile); no winglets, no wing tip tanks; no sweep, straight leading edge, no twist, constant profile, no dihedral; effect of the wing deformation on the loads not considered; no spoilers or airbrakes; landing gear attached to fuselage;  no wing struts (cantilever wing);     References List of Abbreviations CG centre of gravity LE leading edge ISA international standard atmosphere by International Organisation for Standardisation  KEAS knots equivalent airspeed MAC mean aerodynamic chord MTOW maximum take-off weight SI international system of units  angle of attack of the wing [deg]  local angle of attack of the station i [deg]  wing zero lift angle of attack [deg]  profile zero lift angle of attack [deg] a lift curve slope [1/deg] AR wing aspect ratio calculated by  [] b wing span [m]  average wing span at station i (mid span position of station) [m]  wing span position of MAC [m]  average fuselage width at wing section [m]  maximum fuselage width (equals ) [m]  local angle between resulting force and normal force at station [deg]  average chord at station i [m]  mean aerodynamic chord [m]  chord at wing root  [m]  chord at wing tip [m]  shear axis relative position as a fraction of local wing chord []  drag coefficient  []  lift coefficient  []  fuselage pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift profile pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient [] D drag force on the wings [N] d span wise drag line loading []  wing sweep of the quarter chord line [deg]  g gravity acceleration [m/s2]  fuselage moment factor []  total wing lift force (on both wings) [N]  local lift at station i [N]  lift line loading on the wing [N/m]  total horizontal tail lift force [N]  total fuselage length [m]  fuselage length in front of wing quarter mean aerodynamic chord point [m]  taper ratio (equals  ) []  wing pitching moment with lift acting on its aerodynamic centre [N]  moments around y axis [Nm]  normal force [N] n load factor [] num total number of stations of a single wing; num = 10 []   density of ambient air at a specific altitude []  running horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  incremental horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  running vertical shear force at station I (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  incremental vertical shear force at station i (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  local resulting force at station i [N] S wing area (not including wing carry-through) []  local tangential force at station i [N]  total torsion around elastic axis of the wing (at wing root) [mN]  local torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  incremental torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  dynamic viscosity (for Reynolds number) [] v airspeed [m/s] W total aircraft weight [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload)  [kg/m2]  total weight of a single wing (with no fuel or payload) [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload) [kg/m2] x longitudinal axis of the aircraft [m] distance to HT quarter chord line from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to aircraft centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to fuel centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE at station i [m]   aerodynamic centre shift due to fuselage pitching moment [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing-fuselage combination with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing fuselage combination from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord)  [m]    shear axis of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m] y lateral axis of the aircraft (span wise direction) [m]  average wing span position at station i [m]  spanwise width of station i [m] z vertical axis of the aircraft [m]  Throughout this document SI-units are used with speeds expected as m/s and angles in degrees if not stated otherwise. Requirements This document covers the following certification specifications requirements: Table 1 – Requirements   Input data The values shown below are derived from design data or other compliance documents for this particular aeroplane.   Load Calculation  The following steps have been followed: Load cases: First, the load cases have been identified in, in terms of weight, centre of gravity, speed, load factor, flap/aileron position, Altitude.  External Loads on the wing: for all load cases, the loads on the wing are calculated; Internal Loads in the wing: for the same load cases the internal loads in the wing (shear, bending moment, torsion) are calculated considering also the effect of the inertia of the wing;  Load cases Table 3 comprises all load cases corresponding to the points of the flight envelope  and design weights and centres of gravity .  Important:  Loads corresponding to flap deflected are considered not critical for the wing and will not be calculated in this document (flap loads will be calculated instead for the flap verification). Loads corresponding to landing conditions are considered not critical for the wing (since the landing gear is attached to the fuselage and no tip tanks or other large masses under the wing) and will not be calculated in this document. For the gust load calculations the wing and horizontal tail are treated together according to X3.1 in ref. . The resulting gust load accelerations are therefore calculated using the slope of the lift curve of the aeroplane (see also ) and treated as balanced flight conditions within this document.  Note: These assumptions have been considered realistic for this aeroplane but they are not of generic validity. It is the responsibility of the applicant to define the set of assumptions which can be acceptable for the particular aeroplane.   Altitude: The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. in fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)    Figure 1 – Reference flight envelope (WMTOW, FL 100) Table 2 – Design weights (explained in ref. ) Table 3 – Load cases Note: For this revision of this example document, asymmetric load cases have not been calculated. Loads on the aeroplane Reference axes and sign convention  Figure 2 – Aeroplane reference axes The origin is located at the airplane axis of symmetry (x axis) with the y axis passing through the leading edge of the mean aerodynamic chord section of the wing. Symmetrical flight conditions The loads on the wing structure arising from symmetrical flight manoeuvres according to requirements 5.2.2 and 5.2.3  are determined within this chapter.  The following abbreviations are used within this chapter (all measurements with respect to wing leading edge at wing mean aerodynamic chord, forces acting according to arrows are positive) x longitudinal axis of the aircraft z vertical axis of the aircraft CG aircraft centre of gravity HT horizontal tail L lift force on the wings  horizontal tail balancing force (HT lift force)  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient (lift force assumed to act on  )  total pitching moment (must be zero for equilibrium) n W aircraft total weight force (= m*n*g )  distance to HT quarter chord line (of HT MAC as quarter chord line)  distance to aircraft centre of gravity  distance to wing fuselage combination centre of pressure   (lift force acting on not generating any pitching moment)  distance to wing fuselage combination aerodynamic centre   (lift force acting on generating constant pitching moment ) The external forces and moments acting on the aeroplane in a balanced flight condition have been determined. The\\xa0simplified scheme in Figure 3 is considered. The aeroplane is reduced to the wing and the Horizontal tail.  Figure 3 – Aeroplane simplified scheme The following forces are considered and placed in equilibrium:  Lift on the wing; Horizontal tail balancing load according to requirement 5.2.2.1 ; Weight of the aeroplane; For the calculation of the equilibrium, the z-axis of the aeroplane is assumed aligned with the direction of the gravity. In a second stage (section 6.4), once the forces are calculated, the corresponding angle of attack will be considered for the calculation of the correct direction of the forces on the wing;  Influence of thrust and drag (of the total airplane) are considered negligible at this stage of calculation of the vertical forces. The effect of the drag will be considered in a second stage on the wing only; The wing lift is assumed to act on the aerodynamic centre of the wing as a starting point. The contribution of the fuselage is accounted for as a shift of the point of aerodynamic centre. This is better explained in section 6.1.5. The HT lift is applied at 25% of the chord; Effects of structural flexure are considered negligible; Angular accelerations are disregarded until the aeroplane has attained the prescribed load factor (according to requirement 5.2.2.3 ); Note: The assumptions above provide a clear simplification to the calculations. The fact that they are used here does not mean that they can always be used. It is the responsibility of the designer to make the appropriate assumptions and to agree them with the Agency. Based on the above assumptions the following equilibrium equations are set. The basis system of equations include 4 equations with the following unknowns: L: wing Lift (including fuselage) CL: wing lift coefficient LHT: HT lift XAC f+w: aerodynamic centre w+f (wing + fuselage; see sec. 6.1.3 and 6.1.5) Equilibrium of moments  (f. 6.1.2.1) Equilibrium of forces   (f. 6.1.2.2) wing pitching moment   (f.6.1.2.3) (for wing) wing lift coefficient  (f. 6.1.2.4) Aerodynamic centre The aerodynamic centre is a characteristic of the wing and it is defined as the point about which the pitch moment does not change with changes of the angle of attack throughout the linear range of the lift curve.  According to  the aerodynamic centre can be estimated by adding a correction factor (shift) to the quarter chord point of the mean aerodynamic chord. The correction factor is a function of the maximum thickness of the profile which in this wing is 16% of the chord. For a tapered wing, the mean aerodynamic chord corresponds to the mean chord and it is  (see ). For this wing the correction factor is 0.012 (from Fig.2  at 16% thickness), so the mean aerodynamic centre of the wing without fuselage is    (f. 6.1.3.1) Pitching moment of the wing The pitching moment of the profile from two dimensional wind tunnel test data  does not represent the moment of a three dimensional with the profile. The pitching moment of the whole wing is calculated according to DATCOM method 1 (formula 4.1.4.1.a ).  (formula 4.1.4.1.a ) (f. 6.1.4.1) With quarter chord sweep angle of the wing .   Influence of the fuselage The fuselage is assumed to provide negligible lift. On the other hand, its influence on the aeroplane equilibrium is accounted for as a contribution to the pitching moment. In particular the following formula (taken from ref ) provides the shift of the aerodynamic centre of the wing due to fuselage pitching moment.  (f. 6.1.5.1) With  and  as input to the diagram in  yielding  and a correction factor of 1.05 due to low-wing configuration. The shift of aerodynamic centre, due to the fuselage, is calculated as:   (f. 6.1.5.2) Forces and moments acting on the wings In previous chapter the Lift and the lift coefficient have been determined. Having those as inputs, the drag and angle of attack are calculated. Total wing drag coefficient  (FIG. X2.1 of)(f. 6.2.1) Drag force on the wings  (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.2) The angle of attack (using as reference instead of ) for each load case is calculated using the following formula:   (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.3) Where: lift curve slope    (FIG. X2.1 of ) (f. 6.2.4) and the zero-lift angle of the wing is taken as . This value is the zero-lift angle of the corresponding wing profile, taken from ref  (p.236).   The results of this chapter for the load cases highlighted in subchapter 0 are presented within the table below. Table 4 – Loads on the aeroplane Unsymmetrical flight conditions Note: These load cases will not be calculated within this revision of the example document.   Wing load distribution After having calculated the total load on the wing, the load distribution is calculated and shown in the following sections. Every load is assumed to act on the span wise centre of each station.  Figure 4 – Location of wing stations Wing lift distribution The wing lift distribution is calculated here. The lift contribution of the fuselage is assumed to be zero (this means that the load which would act in correspondence of the fuselage, is shifted externally to the wing) leading to more conservative results on the wing loads since they provide higher bending. Note: Alternatively, the applicant would have to determine the reduction in wing lift distribution at the location of the fuselage and demonstrate the validity of the approach.  Figure 5 – Effect of the fuselage, areas A (total lift calculated at the end of this chapter)  and B (total lift according to Schrenk) are of equal size   This approach is based on the approximation described by Schrenk  and requires adjustments: moving the apex of the elliptical distribution from the fuselage centre towards the wing root increasing lift of wetted wing sections to compensate for zero lift of fuselage wing section The formula for wing lift distribution is derived from Schrenk  and is altered to assume zero lift at the wing section within the fuselage as shown below. The formula gives the value of the lift for span unit. “i” identifies the individual station.   Figure 6 –  lift distribution with zero lift at fuselage wing section   ()  (f. 6.4.1.1) Now the lift of the wing section within the fuselage is redistributed across the wetted wing area to achieve conservative results. The lift distribution calculated above is adjusted by multiplication of a correction factor derived from comparison between total lift of the whole wing including the fuselage section and the wetted wing only.  Figure 7 – Fuselage wing section lift redistributed across wetted wing stations        or  (f. 6.4.1.2) The lift distribution corresponding to the formula above, gives a value of lift at wing tip which is higher than zero and therefore does not fully reproduce the actual loading (the winglift is normally zero at the tip). Nevertheless this assumption does not give significant changes and yields conservative results. The local angle of attack for the station I, as a result of this corrected Schrenk distribution, is given by the following formula:  (from f.6.2.3 and f.6.1.2.4) (f. 6.4.1.3) Note: FAA AC 23-19A, paragraph 23.301, contains other acceptable methods.   Figure 9 – Span wise lift distribution  Wing drag distribution Since the effect of the drag is negligible, when compared to the effect of the lift, the span wise drag distribution has been assumed constant throughout wing span. This is a conservative assumption. The drag loading per metre of span:   (f. 6.4.2.1) Wing and fuel mass distribution The local masses are calculated for each wing station to account for the mass of the structure of the wing including the systems and control surfaces (control systems, and other equipment). It is assumed that the wing has a linear distribution proportional to the chord. At each station the point of application of the mass is 45% of the chord.  Figure 10 – Wing mass distribution  Figure 11 – Fuel distribution A constant fuel distribution (at a point of application of 20% of the chord) is assumed throughout the fuel tank span.  Table 5 – Mass distribution with full fuel Wing torsion distribution At each station, the wing lift is assumed to be acting at the local centre of pressure, which is calculated using the formula:  (from eq. 9.17.(d) )  (f. 6.4.4.1) Where, ci is the chord at each station, cm0_w_i is the pitching moment around the aerodynamic centre of the wing section (it is -0.0436 across the wing from chapter 6.1.4), CL_i is the local lift coefficient and comes from the corrected Schrenk distribution () in 6.1.5. Therefore centre of pressure location is dependent on the local angle of attack. Each station’s lift force acts on its centre of pressure and imposes torsion around the wing elastic axis which for this aeroplane is located approximately at a constant chord percentage of 30% (see design data - the main spar is approximately at 25% of the chord) throughout the entire wing span with local positions  as local shear centres at the stations. Note: the location of the elastic axis for this wing has been assumed at 30%. It is responsibility of the applicant to determine and justify the location of the elastic axis.  Incremental torsion load on structure at each station with respect to local wing shear centre including contribution of fuel and wing structure inertia forces:   (f..2) Torsion at each station i (with respect to shear centre) is:    (f. 6.4.4.3) Distribution of internal loads The components of the internal loads on the wing structure are calculated in different steps for each station. The flight load factor n is assumed to act in parallel to the direction of the lift force instead of the direction of the normal force (As required by 5.2.1.1 of ref. ). The difference is assumed negligible. The incremental shear load parallel to lift force vector at station i is taking into account also the inertia unloading of the wing   (f. 6.4.5.1) Incremental shear load parallel to drag force vector at station i:   (f. 6.4.5.2) With  representing the width of the station i. The summation of incremental shear loads throughout the stations to obtain the absolute shear loads at station i is presented below. Shear load parallel to lift force vector   (f..3) Shear load parallel to drag force vector   (f. 6.4.5.4) The components of the loads along the normal and tangential directions are derived by using the following formulas and figure:  Figure 12 – Forces components on the wing (The tangential force is oriented opposite to the x axis and is therefore positive when directed towards the front of the aeroplane.) Resulting force angle   (f.6.4.5.5)  Shear loads along the directions of:  resulting force  (f. 6.4.5.6)  tangential force  (f. 6.4.5.7)  normal force  (f. 6.4.5.8) With the local angle of attack for the station i as a result of the corrected Schrenk distribution given by the following formula:  (from f. 6.4.1.4) Summation of shear loads to obtain the bending moments at each station and using the increased lever arm ( instead of  ) at the wing tip station results in slightly more conservative values. Bending moment along normal direction   (f. 6.4.5.9) Bending moment along tangential direction    (f. 6.4.5.10) The results are presented within the graphs and tables below.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The permissible centre of gravity range is dictated by the aerodynamic design requirements for the airplane. Then the centre of gravity locations corresponding to the critical weights are calculated. All units used are metric (SI units) except for airspeeds (CAS) given in knots if not stated otherwise. Note: The values defined within this document should be used for the placards, markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by testing.

The data contained herein is used to establish aeroplane loading limits: Table 2 – Mass items (Note: In this document the weight of the empty aircraft is assumed to be determined through direct weighing. Such information might be needed during early phases of the design, when no prototype is available. In this case the weight of the empty aircraft should be determined through estimation. It is important in this case to have a breakdown of the main items in terms of weight and locations, so that the weight can be kept under control and avoid situations where the assumed envelope cannot be achieved.) Aircraft weights The following design weights have been identified since: either they are clearly required by the CS-LSA requirements, or they impose critical loads or flight characteristics. Basic empty weight WBEW The basic empty weight needs to be determined to identify its centre of gravity according to requirement 4.2.3  as empty CG. All load conditions determined within this document are based on the basic empty weight of the aircraft. It includes empty weight of the aircraft and the unusable amount of fuel. Basic empty weight has been determined to WBEW = 366 kg. Note: The basic empty weight must include all equipment for the operation intended including optional avionics packages – for example. Basic empty weight (366 kg) vs maximum empty weight WMEW (400kg) According to 4.2.1 of , the minimum useful load  should be 200kg consisting of 172Kg = both seats occupied with persons of 86kg each (4.2.1.1 ) 28kg = fuel for 1 hour flight at  as determined by  (4.2.1.2 ) According to 3.1.2  the maximum empty weight of the aeroplane shall be equal to: . The aeroplane complies with its Basic empty weight including unusable fuel: . Minimum flying weight Wmin (421kg) The minimum flying weight needs to be determined by requirement 4.2.2  and is a design load case leading to highest load factors during gust penetration. It assumes only a pilot of weight of 55 kg.  Minimum full fuel flying weight WminFF (495kg) The minimum flying weight with full fuel is a design load case imposing highest load factors on the fuel tank. This is critical for the fuel tank design and it can be critical also for the wing structure since in this scenario the highest inertia load on the fuel tank introduces torsion about the shear centre in the same direction of the wing aerodynamic load of the wing (the CG of the fuel is forward to the shear centre which is forward to the wing centre of pressure). Maximum zero wing fuel weight WZWF (600kg) The maximum zero wing fuel weight needs to be determined by requirement 5.2.1.3  and is a design load case for the wing loads due to lowest inertia discharge of the wing structure. In this aeroplane this weight equals the Maximum Take-off weight.  Maximum take-off weight WMTOW (600kg) The total aircraft weight must not exceed 600kg regardless whether the aircraft is on ground or in flight. The gross weight of the aeroplane shall not exceed WMTOW = 600kg. The maximum landing weight equals the maximum take-off weight. Loading cases The following loading conditions have been established to identify the critical cases. Table 3 – Loading cases for standard configuration   Centre of gravity location The maximum permissible centre of gravity locations are defined within this chapter. Flight limits The maximum permissible centre of gravity range during flight with respect to datum plane is most forward 0.25m   (required by  4.2.3) most rearward 0.39m   (required by  4.2.3) Limitations on ground The most rearward centre of gravity with the plane on ground must not exceed (with respect to datum plane) 0.46m to prevent the aircraft from flipping on the tail although not more than 0.41m might be reached with the most critical loading configuration. Centre of gravity envelope The following table of load cases defines the limits for the certified envelope of centre of gravity locations and the position of load cases of 6.7 within the envelope. Table 4 – Load cases on centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration   The centre of gravity envelope covers all valid loading cases.  Figure 1 – Centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration Expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification To cover alterations to the aeroplane where need might arise or after certification the aeroplane will be tested and certified against an extended envelope. Additional weights will be added during testing at their corresponding locations to establish the desired loading cases. Table 5 – Weights required to achieve expanded envelope for certification   The expanded centre of gravity envelope is defined by the load cases below using ballast weights at their corresponding locations. Table 6 – Load cases on expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification Note: The values above are preliminary assumptions. Ballast weights need to be checked to be in accordance with airframe strength limitations and their impact on the flight characteristics in terms of inertia before test flights. This might require narrowing the centre of gravity envelope.  Figure 2 – Expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification Compliance statements Compliance statements are shown below:      ']\n"

considered its more common use of deter planning and fmc performance factors cruise performance monitoring can help airlines identify and solve in performance problems often performance monitoring will identify need for boeing to assist in determining the solution to given in problem however with good understanding of the monitoring process and the interactions among the variables involved airlines heir own problem diagnosing and solving cruise performance monitoring has been used for many years by airlines that strive to operate their airplanes as ef as possible these airlines know that continuous cruise performance monitoring of airplanes in their can decrease operating costs relative to airlines that do not monitor airplane performance levels continuous cruise performance monitoring can give airlines the information they need to just the baseline performance levels they use for planning and management computer mc fuel predictions so that the correct amount of fuel is loaded on each and every entify normal deterioration for of airplanes at ch the airplanes that perform best to their longest routes entify high fuel burning airplanes for possible maintenance validate performance degradation for extended twin operations top critical fuel reserves planning lieu of the regulatory requirement of percent fuel mileage deterioration allowance crease crew con in plans and possibly decrease the amount of discretionary fuel requested and loaded an additional less recognized bene of cruise performance monitoring is diagnosing and solving various airplane performance problems or issues these case studies show how cruise performance monitoring was used to determine solutions to three different problems an airline that operates airplane was concerned about what it considered to be exc ive fuel mileage deterioration relative to the fuel mileage levels its airplanes exhibited when they were new the airline requested help from both boeing and the engine manufacturer in de te mining what was causing this deterioration the airframe the engine or both through better understanding of the contributions that airframe and engine deterioration make to the overall fuel mileage deterioration the airline could more ef focus its maintenance resources to help resolve this issue the airline proposed an experiment involving an engine exchange airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration by dave anderson flight operations engineer and carolyn han reiter aerodynamics engineer aero quarterly qtr ew total fuel mileage diff er ence ol to ne airplane using he ol an ne engine between an old and new airplane six which was operating about percent below the planning database level of fuel mileage represented the old airplane while soon represented the new one the airline requested assistance and support from boeing and the engine manufacturer in carrying out the experiment which would ea sure pre fuel mileage on both the new and the old airplane swap swap all four engines between the new and old airplane ea sure fuel mileage again on both the new and the old airplane swap by using the same physical set of four engines on two different airframes the airline boeing and the engine manufacturer agreed that any measurable difference in fuel mileage for the same set of engines on two different airframes could be attributed to airframe effects alone that is drag deterioration boeing position was that proper maintenance of the exterior of an airplane would lead to minimal amounts of drag deterioration as an airplane ages as result the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including con inspection so that it would be considered as having properly maintained exterior before the engine swap control surfaces were re rigged seals were repaired and one engine was replaced minor leak in the pneumatic system discovered during the was not by the airline to cause about percent penalty in fuel mileage fuel mileage data was collected before and after the to determine any change across the check especially to quantify any changes resulting from re rigging the control surfaces and replacing any worn seals fuel mileage improved percent after the with percent attributed to proper re rigging of the controls and percent attributed to the changing of one engine fuel mileage data was then collected on both the old and new airplanes before and after the engine swap the data collected was combination of in data collected by the airplane condition monitoring system acm and hand data that was collected under more controlled test conditions average results from all four sets of data were then compared to determine the differences in fuel mileage between the old and new airplanes with the same set of engines for both the old and new engines the average improvement in fuel mileage for the new airframe relative to the old airframe was about percent the initial conclusion could be that the older airframe must contribute about percent toward the overall fuel mileage deterioration originally observed on the old airplane and engine combination however about percent of that difference is explainable of the total calculated difference of percent the pneumatic duct leakage discovered on the old airplane during the contributed about percent in addition the old airplane did not have the same revised vertical fairing as the new if the older airplane had had the newer vertical fairing it is estimated that the fuel mileage would have improved about percent after adjusting for the pneumatic system leak and the newer vertical fairing for the same set of engines the old airplane fuel mileage averaged about percent worse than the new airplane the results are supportive of the position that the drag deterioration of well airplane most likely will not exceed more than about percent the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including cong ration inspection boeing ne vertical fin fairing pneumatic leakage actual unexplainable diff er ence case study to help determine the primary cause of the fuel mileage deterioration boeing and the airline collected fuel mileage data on both new and old before and after an engine exchange an airline expressed concern to boeing that its new cfm airplanes equipped with aviation partners boeing apb blended winglets were exhibiting fuel mileage performance more than percent worse than the boeing database level while its older non winglet approximately two years old displayed fuel mileage performance similar to the database level the airline which collects cruise fuel mileage data on an ongoing basis based its analysis on acm cruise fuel mileage data analyzed using the boeing airplane performance monitoring apm program in initial discussions between boeing and the airline it was explained that the database being used by the airline to represent the with blended winglets was based on the original winglet test results completed in early this is the same database used in the flight crew operations manual the mc and the operational planning database additional tests had led to boeing latest best assessment of the delivered performance of the winglets which showed slightly less improvement than the original testing this revised database based on several add ition al test programs conducted in and includes different winglet drag increment to non winglet and an aer elastic correction absent in the earlier database at mach the difference between the two databases varies from percent to percent depending on the exact conditions with the airline database predicting better fuel mileage increment because of the winglets in all cases upon request the airline provided boeing with acm data for two of its airplanes with blended winglets boeing analyzed the data for each airplane using both the operational database and the revised database while the data was on average about percent closer to the newer database level than the operational database level boeing analysis did not agree with the airline analysis boeing analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the airline further discussions with the airline revealed that it had been using passenger weight allo ance of kg per passenger including carry baggage and kg per checked bag for all of its as of june the airline changed to the higher passenger weight allowances recommended in the joint aviation requirements operations ar checked baggage would be weighed whenever possible otherwise ar checked baggage weight allowances would be used the average passenger weight allowances are igni higher than the kg per passenger the airline had been using because the data sent to boeing for the two winglet airplanes was collected prior to june it was based on the lighter weight allowance of kg per investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall boeing analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the airline aero quarterly qtr passenger the airline analysis was based on data using combination of the weight allowances as the investigation continued the airline sent additional data to boeing for the same two winglet airplanes but only for conditions recorded after june based on the higher jar weight allowances the airline also included data for one more winglet airplane as well as for three non winglet airplanes the data for the two winglet airplanes showed an immediate fuel mileage improvement of about percent for each airplane based on analyzing only the data from ar weight allowances collected after june this result led quickly to the belief that the previous kg per passenger weight allowance was too light although both the fuel mileage and thrust required changed igni between data based on kg per passenger and data based on ar passenger weight allowances the thrust fuel consumption tsf hardly changed errors in the estimated weight of an airplane present themselves as high or low drag but do not affect the fuel tsf deviations calculated by apm igni improvement was observed for both of the winglet airplanes originally analyzed with data recorded before june the results for all six airplanes were still not as good as what boeing experience indicated for this model further investigation determined that this airline operates its of in mix of both scheduled and holiday charter using the spec ar weight allowances called out for each the data sent to boeing for the six airplanes included mixture of data from both these types of the average passenger weight allowance recommended for scheduled service is kg per passenger and kg per passenger for charter service are higher than the kg per passenger originally used by the airline at boeing request the airline separated all of the post june data into two groups charter service and scheduled service the data for each group was reanalyzed separately and the analysis revealed igni discrepancy in demonstrated fuel mileage and thrust levels between the charter and scheduled if airplane weight is underestimated perceived airplane performance will be poorer than expected weight that is unaccounted for shows up as increased airplane drag and decreased fuel mileage in this analysis the tsf deviations remained consistent between both sets of data but the thrust deviations increased igni for the charter strong indication of unaccounted airplane weight in this situation boeing proposed that the jar passenger weight allowances as recommended for holiday charter were underestimating the airplane weight for this particular airline charter operations although the airline was receptive to the possibility that the ar passenger weight allowances might be too light for its holiday charter it was not fully convinced the airline believed that the ar weight allowances for scheduled could just as easily be incorrect in which case their airplanes were performing as poorly as the charter data indicated to determine which weight allowances were correct the airline and boeing agreed to collect delivery performance data on the airline next new airplane delivery with production blended winglets installed the advantages of collecting delivery data as opposed to in data are he performance level of the airplane could be established at delivery he airplane would be weighed at the boeing factory with all the weight changes following weighing but preceding delivery accurately tracked and published in the weight and balance manual therefore the delivery empty weight could be considered accurate delivery are with minimum crew so the issue of passenger weight allowances would not exist after collecting cruise performance data on the delivery the airline would continue with its standard in data collection on both scheduled and charter comparing the results from the delivery with the results obtained in would help determine which jar passenger weight allowances gave the airline more accurate airplane gross weights if the weight allowances were too heavy airplane was actually lighter than estimated then the in performance would appear to be better than the delivery performance if the weight allowances were too light airplane was heavier than estimated then the in performance would appear to be worse than the delivery level the airline provided boeing with the weeks of acm in data for the airplane following delivery separating the data for charter and scheduled for this analysis the data was analyzed relative to the most recent with winglets database although the delivery results showed the airplane to be slightly better than the demonstrated database level the early in charter results show the airplane with an average per fuel mileage percent worse than the demonstrated level unaccounted weight shows up as airplane drag required according to the charter data the airplane experienced percent increase in thrust required on entering service partially offset by percent drop in engine tsf for percent drop in fuel mileage from the delivery level when the same ai plane scheduled service data for the same time period was analyzed the fuel mileage was much closer to the delivery level average in fuel mileage for the weeks of operation deviated from the delivery level by only percent percent below the demonstrated level which is within the acm ability to determine fuel mileage over given time period these results supported the conclusion that for this airline the ar passenger weight allo ance for scheduled more accurately re the true weight of the passengers plus carry baggage than the weight allowances recommended for the charter in addition both are much more representative than the original kg per passenger the airline had been using the weight allowances for scheduled of kg per passenger produce more accurate zero fuel weight buildup and truer representation of the actual performance of the airplane with or without winglets the results of this case study ident airplane weight buildup issue for this particular airline boeing suggested that the jar holiday charter passenger weight allowances appeared to be too light for this airline operations with unaccounted weight showing up as excess airplane thrust required using the ar passenger weight allowances for scheduled the fuel

completed many weeks before the winglets were installed with the airplanes returning to service with the reinforced wings for these airplanes the non winglet data was based on this reinforced wing con three of the airplanes had the wing reinforced and winglet installed at the same time for these three airplanes the non winglet data was based on the production non reinforced wing the two sets of data were analyzed separately in order to identify any differences in the improvement based on differences in the baseline before the winglets were installed boeing analyzed the data for all airplanes using the same in software tools used to analyze boeing data these software tools are different from the apm software provided to airline customers but the analysis produces basically the same results the main difference is that the boeing in software normalizes the data points to nominal weight to pressure ratios chosen by boeing while the apm software does not the improvements were plotted versus in order to illustrate that the magnitude of the improvement depends on for given mach number this dependency on is because the winglet improvement is function of airplane lift coef which in turn is

reinforcement of the wing structure the results indicated this improve to be relatively small but still worth an average of few tenths of percentage at normal cruise weights and altitudes including the effects of both the wing strengthening and the addition of the winglets the fuel mileage and drag improve closely matched their predicted levels because the improvement in drag is fun of for given cruise speed the actual improvement in fuel mileage that the airline would experience for any given conditions depends on the during that airline operations the change in total fuel required to given

combined with airline process improvements can reduce maintenance cosy and improve the ability to show conformance boeing has continually made enhancements to the content format and delivery of its service bulletins past enhancements include digital delivery simp li english and tabular work instructions boeing has been working directly with airlines to reduce end costs for service bulletin incorporation during this process it was observed that when airlines create their engineering orders they rewrite or re engineer service bulletins and re kit or repackage the kit of parts to match their own engineering orders this re engineering causes unnecessary delays and expense for the airlines in implementing service bulletins boeing developed the enhanced service bulletin also known as the generation service bulletin to minimize this re engineering effort while making it easier and less expensive to implement service bulletins the enhanced service bulletin in conjunction with airline process improvements will enable smooth work ensuring that information parts and tools are staged in coordinated manner to support the mechanic during service bulletin incorporation boeing

quarterly qtr th dream liner ta ke adv ant age of ne tec ologies to increase re lia bi lit an im pro ve maintain abi lit boeing with the dream liner boeing is using new approach to design which takes into greater account the cost to maintain airplane structure and systems over their lifetimes as result of this approach the basic airplane will have percent lower airframe maintenance costs than any comparable product and will be available for revenue service more often than any other commercial airplane the boeing program has consciously designed in new state features and performance that reduce cost and increase airplane availability these features will lead to additional savings and greater revenue for boeing customers the re new life design philosophy that has dictated some igni changes in the way the airplane will be built these changes include extensive use of composites in the airframe and primary structure an electric systems architecture reliable and maintainable design and an improved maintenance program taken together these changes will offer customers guaranteed reduction in maintenance costs the life cost approach to design looks at the total cost picture for design options by examining all of the factors that affect an airplane over its lifetime traditionally the value of given design solution has been measured using factors such as drag weight oise and community schedule reliability development cost uil cost using these measures to compare design options helps determine the optimum choice with the boeing has expanded the life design approach by adding two unique performance measures maintenance cost and airplane availability clearly looking at the cost to maintain systems over their lifetimes becomes igni factor when attempting to understand the total effect of design decision on an operator cost structure airplane availability includes not only schedule reliability but also other factors such as the length of time an airplane must be out when maintenance is required obviously taking an airplane out of service for two days has much bigger effect on operator revenue than taking it out of service for two hours boeing from the ground upby justin hale deputy chief mechanic aero quarterly qtr advanced composites aluminum titanium steel landing gear boeing makes greater use of composite materials in its airframe and primary structure than any previous boeing commercial airplane under the design process without preconceived ideas enabled boeing engineers to specify the optimum material for spec applications throughout the airframe the result is an airframe comprising nearly half carbon reinforced plastic and other composites this approach offers weight savings on average of percent compared to more conventional aluminum designs selecting the optimum material for spec application meant analyzing every area of the airframe to determine the best material given the operating environment and loads that component experiences over the life of the airframe for example aluminum is sensitive to tension loads but handles compression very well on the other hand composites are not as ef in dealing with compression loads but are excellent at handling tension the expanded use of composites especially in the highly tension environment of the fuselage greatly reduces maintenance due to fatigue when compared with an aluminum structure this type of analysis has resulted in an increased use of titanium as well where loading indicates metal is preferred material system but environmental considerations indicate aluminum is poor choice titanium is an excellent low design solution titanium can withstand comparable loads better than aluminum has minimal fatigue con and is highly resistant to corrosion titanium use has been expanded on the to roughly percent of the total airframe every structural element of the has undergone this type of life analysis and material types are based on thorough and disciplined selection

same manner that airlines would repair an airplane today with bolted repairs these can be just as permanent and damage tolerant as they are on metal structure boeing in addition to lowering the overall airplane weight moving to composite primary structure promises to reduce both the scheduled and nonroutine maintenance burden on the airlines reduced scheduled maintenance ex per ence with the boeing proves that composite str ct ure require less scheduled maintenance than noncom structures for example the composite tail is percent larger than the aluminum tail yet requires percent fewer scheduled maintenance labor hours this labor hour reduction is due to the result of reduced risk of corrosion and fatigue of composites compared with metal reduced nonroutine maintenance com structure also results in less nonroutine maintenance the structure is all composite and highlights the advantages of this material when applied in harsh environ airline operators are aware of the fatigue cracking and corrosion dif experienced with traditional aluminum beams the model has been for more than years with more than airplanes in the and to date has not replaced single composite beam boeing has also implemented rigorous process for evaluating the use of aluminum that combines likelihood of corrosion with consequence of corrosion this scoring system provides de measure for establishing acceptable application of aluminum in the design with full understanding of the maintenance implications corrosion and fatigue in structure add igni to the nonroutine maintenance burden on an operator nonroutine maintenance frequently double or even triples the total labor hours expended during maintenance check with the expanded use of composites and titanium combined with greater discipline in usage of aluminum boeing expects the to have much lower nonroutine labor costs than more conventional metallic airframe in addition to using robust structural design in damage areas such as passenger and cargo doors the has been designed from the start with the capability to be repaired in exactly the same manner that airlines would repair an airplane today with bolted repairs the ability to perform bolted repairs in composite structure is service on the and offers comparable repair times and skills as employed on metallic airplanes by design bolted repairs in composite structure can be permanent and damage tolerant just as they can be on metal structure in addition airlines have the option to perform bonded composite repairs which offer improved aerodynamic and aesthetic these repairs are permanent damage tolerant and do not require an autoclave while typical bonded repair may require or more hours of airplane downtime boeing has taken advantage of the properties of composites to develop new line of maintenance repair capability that requires less the right material for the right application without preconceived ideas boeing engineers were able to specify the optimum material for spec applications throughout the airframe aero quarterly qtr than an hour to apply this rapid composite repair technique offers temporary repair capability to get an airplane

chapter kln system components basic kln system consists of panel mounted kln and ka gps antenna an altitude input is required to obtain full navigation and operational capabilities additional system components may be added or interfaced to the kln which increase its features and capabilities some of these optional compo ne nts include an external course deviation indicator or horizontal situation indicator autopilot and external an nuncia tors typically an altitude input an external indicator and external annunciators are required for ifr approach certification kln panel mounted unit contains the gps sensor the navigation computer gas plasma discharge display and all con rol required to operate the unit it also includes the data base card which slides into the left side of the front panel ka gps antenna is available for use with the kln it is designed to always be mounted on the top of the aircraft kln has analog outputs to drive the left deviation bar of most mechanical cdi and hsi in addition the nav mode of the bendix fc ka ka ka fc ka fc fc fc and fc flight control systems may be coupled to the kln many other autopilots may also be coupled to the kln actual autopilot performance and capability when coupled to the kln may vary significantly from one autopilot model to another may be provided to the kln from an encoding al time ter or blind encoder altitude is used as an aid in position determination when not enough satellites are in view all ifr installations require remote annunciators to be mounted in the aircraft panel in order to select and indicate the status of certain kln functions en route and terminal ifr certifications require annunciators for message and way point alert non precision approach certifications also require switch to select and display when the approach mode is armed or active each kln system includes configuration module which is attached to the kln mounting rack the module allows the kln to be configured for the unique characteristics of your equipment installation parameters that are set by the configuration module include the kln may be used for ifr operations or not if it may be used for non approach ifr operations kln may only be used for vfr navigation or not the altitude alert function in enabled see section or not an external fuel management system is interfaced to the kln see section or not an external air data computer

coverage area overlap in americas north americas south data base coverage areas figure kln data base geographical region kln pilot guided ata base base chapter data base data basics the data base provides two primary functions first it makes pilot interface with the gps sensor much easier rather than having to manually look up and then enter the latitude and longitude for spe ci fic way point it allows you to merely enter simple way point identifier the data base automatically looks up and displays the lati tude and longitude associated with the identifier it should be obvious that the data base saves lot of tedious latitude entry and also greatly reduces the potential for data input mistakes second function of the data base is that it serves as very con means to store and easily access aeronautical information want to know the name of the airport the nearest city or the airport elevation just unleash the power of the kln and display the information right on the screen the kln data base stores non approaches in their proper sequence this allows you to select an approach as whole rather than entering the approach way point by way point data base contents and coverage areas there are four data base coverage areas available for the kln they are referred to as the north data base the south data base the data base and the data base international civil aviation organization and aeronautical radio inc break the world into the ten geographic regions shown in figure the kln americas north data base con tains aeronautical information for the group of icao regions consisting of canada usa and latin america the kln americas south data base contains aeronautical information for the group of icao regions consisting of usa latin america and south america the kln atlantic data

caution danger moa training warning user defined way points identifier latitude and longitude icao identifiers way points are stored in the kln database almost exclusively by their icao identifiers icao civil aviation organization is an internationally accepted reference for the data in almost all cases the proper icao identifiers may be taken directly from eppes en or nos aeronautical charts identifiers in the contiguous united states alaska and canada are special cases in the icao system many airport ident fie rs for these areas have four letters beginning with prefix letter that corresponds to the geographic area in which it is located the prefix letter for the contiguous is thus the identifier for dallas worth international airport is dfw not dfw would be identical to the vor identifier likewise the identifier for orlando executive airport is kor while the vor identifier is orl the prefix letter for canada is and for alaska is there are several exceptions in alaska in many cases air ports with three letter identifiers receive the prefix but there are many that don the most reliable method of determining an alaska airport identifier is to look it up from the airport name or city see sec tion way points by name or city you can program the kln to default to certain letter as when you are entering way point identifier see section entry to learn about this handy feature all airport identifiers receive the prefix letter airport identifiers which are combinations of letters and numbers do not apply to the prefix rule examples of airport identifiers not using the prefix are and remember if you are entering or looking for an airport ident fie that is all letters numbers then it will begin with prefix in the contiguous in alaska some cases or in canada if there are numbers in the identifier then prefix is not used for other areas of the world the airport iden ti fie stored in the kln data base is identical to how it is charted updating the data base the information stored in the data base would eventually become obsolete if there wasn some means to update it for example new airports open navaids can move or change frequency com munic tion frequencies can change and on and on base base chapter by faa regulation you are required to have current data base in order to use the kln for non approach data base is contained in small card which plugs into the left side of the kln front panel it is designed so that there are two ways for the user to easily keep the data base current the first is to electronically update the data base by means of diskette supplied by honeywell and an ibm personal computer this method does not have to involve removing the kln from the aircraft instrument panel jack usually mounted in the air craft instrument panel provides means of interfacing the kln with the computer via an interface cable the diskettes are not returned to honeywell second method of data base update is to remove the old card and insert current card this method involves returning the old card to honeywell days honeywell receives new nav data from eppes en sanderson this information is processed and down loaded onto both diskettes and data base cards honeywell makes these two types of update services available to you in choice of several subscription or random update programs see section for details on these programs sends the update so that it arrives prior to the next effective date the new update may be installed any time prior to the effective date and the kln will use the previous data up to the effective date and automatically begin using the new data on the effective date warning the accuracy of the data base information is only assured if it is used before the end of the effectivity period use of out of date data base information is done entirely at the user own risk computer updating of the data base update information is sent to you on disks in order to use the update program you must have access to computer having disk drive capable utilizing megabyte high density diskettes this computer also needs to have an available com or com ser ial port if you wish to perform updates in the cockpit an optional pc interface kit must be used included in the kit is an interface cable that plugs into both the computer and into the data loader jack the data loader jack is included with the kln installation kit and is typically installed in the aircraft instrument panel pilot guided ata base base chapter data base base chapter the data base must be updated only while the air craft is on the ground the kln does not perform any navigation function while the data base is being updated since data base update takes approximately minutes it is good idea to turn off all electrical equipment on the aircraft except for the kln to avoid running down the aircraft battery diskettes sent to you can only be used to update one kln although they can update that specific unit numerous times the first time the diskettes are used in an update operation unique identification code from the kln being used is uploaded to the diskettes these diskettes may be used in this specific kln an unlimited number of times which could be required if you switch back and forth between the americas north americas south atlantic and pacific data bases during one update cycle these diskettes may not however be used to update other kln this update protection ensures that eppes en sanderson is properly compensated for the use of their nav data update the kln data base by computer the pin female connector end of the interface cable into com serial port of the computer if the computer has com and com serial ports either may be used some computers use pin com serial port connector while other computers use pin connector if the computer being used has pin connector the interface cable connector will plug directly into the computer pin connector if the computer com serial port uses pin connector use the pin to pin adapter included in the pc interface kit to adapt the interface cable connector to the computer connector you are using the pc interface kit in the cockpit plug the other end of the interface cable conductor male connector into the data loader jack that is mounted in the aircraft panel the diskette into the computer disk drive turn on the computer being used for the data base update the

the time to first fix will usually be less than two minutes if this information is not correct then the kln will start to look for any satellites eventually the kln will find enough satellites to

well acquainted this will allow you to utilize it to the maximum extent great way to get to know the kln is to use it outside the airplane using what we call the mode are products available which allow you to use the kln at your home office or hotel to have get time in the take mode for instance the commander from lone star aviation it is also helpful to do flight planning and perform data

the operation of the kln without worrying about the engine running other traffic or even terrain fortunately these phenomena are not simulated in the take mode kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid approaches and sid only this is the last chapter on the operation of the kln in this chapter you will learn how to use the kln for non approach and sid procedures note that only kln which are configured for ifr approaches are capable of performing the procedures discussed in this chapter kln which are con figured for en route and terminal operations only will give you access to sid procedures but not non procedures all of these procedures require that you are comfortable with the operation of the unit as presented up to this point in particular you need to be comfortable with flight plan operation and and the obs mode non approach operations flying non approaches using the kln are not in them selves very difficult however it is different than using traditional equipment such as vor and ndb with this in mind make sure that you practice with the kln in vfr weather with check pilot before attempting to use the kln in actual ifr conditions the kln obtains approach information from the data base therefore it is extremely important that the data base is current the kln is approved for ifr non approaches only when the data base is current if you attempt to select an approach when the data base is out of date you will be given the status message base expire in the bottom left portion of the screen as reminder following sections assume that your kln is properly installed in the aircraft with all of the necessary accessories to fly non approaches in most cases this will mean that the air craft has external switch to arm the approach mode an external annunciator to indicate when message is active and when way point sequencing is about to occur will also be installed in some installations the aircraft will have nav switch to select which navigation source is displayed on the primary hsi or cdi nav page has been specifically designed to provide most of the functions needed for non approaches this page pro vide an interface that presents pertinent navigation information way to access the flight plan and graphic presentation of the pre sent position relative to the flight plan way points you will find this page to be good friend while performing gps based non approaches approaches and sid and sid there are some approach procedures in the world that are not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base therefore it is not possible to use the kln for these approaches it is good pre flight practice ensure that the kln contains anticipated procedures for the flight addition to the two course modes and obs described in sec there are also two approach modes these are approach arm and approach active the status of the approach mode is indi cat ed on an external switch in most installations the external annunciator will indicate arm for the approach arm mode and approach active will be annunciated by act the main differ ence of these modes from the normal en route mode is that the integrity monitoring is set to tighter level another difference between these modes and the en route mode is that the cdi scale factor will usually change to nm for arm and will always change to nm when in the apr act mode the arm mode can be selected in two ways the normal way is that this mode will be selected automatically by the kln when the aircraft is within nm of an airport and an approach is loaded in the flight plan for that airport it is possible to arm the approach mode at distance greater than nm from the airport by pressing the exter al gps approach switch but the kln will not change the cdi scale factor until the aircraft reaches the nm point if the gps apr external switch is pressed while the approach mode is armed then the kln will disarm the approach and change back to en route mode the cdi scale factor will also change back to nm the approach can be re by simply pressing the gps apr switch again the apr act mode can only be engaged automatically by the kln to cancel the apr act mode press the external gps apr switch this will change the mode to apr arm once past the fa it is not possible to return to the approach active mode without con missed approach and flying back to the fa procedure for non approaches non approaches will all have the general flow of events as follows refer to figure and load the approach into the flight plan can bed one at almost any time but must be completed before reaching the final approach fix and should be done as soon as possible kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid corresponds to point in figure if the aircraft is greater than nm from the airport then the cdi scale factor will remain at the default nm full scale deflection to the approach arm mode this will occur auto when the aircraft is within nm of the airport and there is an approach loaded into the flight plan in fig ure the cdi scale factor will change to nm over the next seconds and the external annunciator will indicate arm established

will be required if the conditions do not change before reaching the fa if all of these conditions are met then the cdi scale factor will start to change to nm and the external annunciator will indicate act the fa in figure the cdi scale factor will be at nm and will remain at this scale factor until you manually cancel the approach mode by either pressing the external gps apr button to change to the arm mode by initiating direct to operation or by changing to obs mode it is not approved to conduct the final portion of the approach unless the kln is in the approach active mode on external annunciator to the missed approach point in figure the kln will not automatically sequence to the next way point must manually change to the appropriate way point accord ing to the situation by default the kln will nominate the first way point of the published missed approach procedure when is pressed and the active way point is the map and you have flown past the map number in section necessary conduct the missed approach procedure remember to always refer to the paper chart when conducting missed approach the obs mode is usually needed at some point during missed approach and is always required to fly the holding pattern in figure details of the above operations as well as several examples of how to conduct non approaches using the kln are given in the following sections and sid and sid selecting an approach the first item in the list from the previous section is to select and load the approach into the active flight plan approaches are selected from the apt act page of the airport for which you desire to shoot the approach if you are operating from flight plan the easi est way to get to the approach information is by turning to the act page for your destination as described in section following example will use the vor or gps rwy approach to los angeles international airport select and load an approach into the active flight plan to one of the apt pages and select lax by using the cursor inner and outer knobs the right inner knob to turn to the apt page if you select ed lax from the apt page turn the inner knob one click counter to reach the apt page the

above you may have noticed couple of way point swith somewhat strange names the second way point of the approach procedure lax has name that is not normal for way point this is an example of what are called way points these are way points that are associated with specific airport they are used to define spot on the ground that does not have normal way point name in the case of this point is nm from the lax vor on the the fifth way point in the approach pro ced ure ma is another type of terminal way point in this case this point is the missed approach point for runway this approach applies to both the left and right runways so the letter is used to mean are few other types of terminal way points that you will need tobe familiar with to fully understand gps non approaches the naming convention for these way points are as follows stands for final approach fi xix yy stands for intermediate fix yy stands for course fix mx yy stands for missed approach point rw zzz rw stands for runway fix this is usually the map for the approach zzz will be runway number possibly including for left for right for center or for both stands for dme arc way point aaa is the radial that the fix is on from the reference vor will be letter corresponding to the distance from the reference vor for example is the seventh letter of the alphabet so would be point on the nm from the reference vor dme arcs greater than nm will have way points where the first two characters are the first two letters of the dme identifier the next three characters will be the radial that the arc way point is on the rules above and yy are defined as follows for runways with only one approach will be replaced with an or for run ways that have multiple approaches will be replaced with for vor for ndb or for rna the letters yy will be replaced with either the runway identifier ff or for circling approaches the inbound course to the missed approach point ma along given radial will be named such that the first three letters are the reference vor and the next two are the dme distance if the distance is greater than nm the order is reversed for example lax is nm from lax while is nm from fl the aircraft is not too far from the destination airport the nav can be used to determine where some of these way points are relative to others in the approach at the time of this writing all of the nos charts and some eppes en charts do not show the special ter mina way points that are required for gps approaches for this reason it is good idea to understand what the special way points are used for and what they mean may have also noticed that some way points have small letter at the end of the way point name the small letter is an aid that we have added to the name of some way points to help you recognize important points in the approach these suffixes are displayed on many of the kln pages the definitions of these suffixes are the initial approach fix of the approach the final approach fix of the approach the missed approach point of the approach the missed approach holding point for the approach every approach will have fa and map almost all will have an iaf and missed approach holding point another item that you should notice in the flight plan is the line that has seq on it this is what is referred to as fence and the purpose of this line is to tell you that approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid kln will not automatically sequence past the way point that precedes the fence the way point before the fence is always the missed approach point the reason that way point sequencing is not allowed is that many missed approach procedures require specific actions before going to the missed approach holding point climbing on fixed heading until reaching an altitude changing or deleting an approach once loaded into the flight plan the sequence of way points that are retrieved from the data base of the kln define the approach procedures as they are charted to ensure that the proper path over the ground is followed it is not possible to either delete or add way points to the approach section of the flight plan to help you see which way points are en route way points and which are approach way points the kln does not display colon next to the way point number on the pl page if the way point is an approach way point it is only possible to replace the existing approach with another one delete the entire approach from the flight plan replace an existing approach or delete an approach the left page displaying the active flight plan turn the cursor on by pressing the cursor so that it covers the approach header at the top of the approach procedure once the cursor comes over the approach header it will automatically change to read change ppr if you press in this condition the kln bring up the apt page that corresponds to the current approach at this point it is poss ble to select different approach procedures different iaf or both you press the button while the cursor is over the approach header it will change to read delete ppr if you press now the kln vor ndb int usr act nav

plan if the kln was in the approach arm or the approach active mode then deleting the approach will cause the kln to change back to en route mode this means that the cdi scale factor will change back to the default nm scale example approach no procedure turn now that you know the basics of inserting an approach into the flight plan we can now show the approach operation of the unit by several examples this first example will use the approach that was loaded into the flight plan in section this example will show how the kln sequences through an approach and what type of an nunci ation and scale factor changes can be expected the kln will remain in the familiar leg mode so there will be no need to change between leg and obs mode in this example refer to the approach plate for this approach to see what the procedure looks like this example it is assumed that you are on an active flight plan with the final destination being the los angeles international airport lax it is also assumed that atc will not give you radar vectors during this approach the vor approach to lax as demonstrated in sec tion you are within nm of the airport the kln will auto mat ically arm the approach mode and provide the following message alt to set baro the message acts as reminder to make sure the kln is using the correct barometric pressure if the barometric information is not correct then the integrity monitoring provided by the kln will not be as good as it could be press to bring up the alt page and verify that the barometric pressure is correct if the kln is interfaced with compatible air data com that provides the correct barometric pressure to the kln then the previous message is not displayed and it is not necessary to update the barometric pressure this time the kln will smoothly change the cdi scale factor to nm the external approach annunciator installed in the aircraft will indicate that the approach is in the arm mode kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid you approach elmo the kln will provide way point alerting on the external annunciator as well as on the screen of the kln once you pass elmo the kln will auto mat ically sequence to the next way point in the approach lax approaches and sid and sid may be good time to select the nav page this page is especially useful for getting feeling of where you are in the approach the aircraft approaches the lax way point the kln will again provide way point alerting as the aircraft passes lax and sequences to fit on the kln will provide message telling you to set the external indicator or hsi to new value if desired track is shown on the screen this value will flash when the external selected course does not match the tk within the aircraft approaches the fa it is good idea to check over the status of the kln look at the kln screen to verify that leg sequencing is selected remember the kln will not transition to the approach active mode if the obs mode is selected if the kln shares an hsi or cdi with other nav sources it is also good to verify that the nav switch is set to gps the time the aircraft is nm from re by the final approach fix the kln will make prediction to see if integrity will be available at the fa and at the map if the pre diction indicates that integrity monitoring will be available and aim is currently available the kln will change the gps apr annunciator to read act at this time the kln will also start to change the cdi scale factor by the time the aircraft reaches the fa the cdi scale factor will be down to nm fix noel is not included in the list of way points provided in the data base you will need to identify this point by using the along track distances given in the profile view of the approach plate in this example noel is located nm from the map when the distance to ma is nm then the aircraft is at noel and you can descend to the md for this approach approach procedures require that you add up several along distances to be able to identify step

perform missed approach remember the kln will not automatically sequence past the missed approach point this is shown on the nav page by not showing any lines connecting way points that are past the map to perform the published missed approach procedure press to bring up the direct page the default way point will be the first way point of the missed approach procedure in this case the first way point is lax confirm this way point as the direct to way point and press reaching lax the kln will sequence to the next way point in the missed approach procedure in ish in this example there is no holding pattern published for the missed approach so you can expect further instructions upon reaching in ish atc gives you instructions for missed approach that is different from the published missed approach procedure it is always possible for you to select different direct to way point than the default direct to way point vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th example approach off navaid an approach that is quite common is an approach that is based off fan off navaid an example of this is the vor rwy approach to clovis new mexico municipal airport kc vn to fly this procedure as published use the following steps and refer to figure for the procedure for this example assume that the aircraft is approaches and sid and sid approaching from the northeast going direct the clovis airport with no active flight plan the approach into the flight plan as described in section in this case there is only one iaf so the kln does not present the option for you to select an iaf in this example there is no active flight plan to begin with so the kln will ask to add the approach to pl the area atc tells you to go direct the tx vor and clears you for the approach to kc vn this is easy to do from the nav page by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning through the active flight plan by turning the inner knob once tx is displayed in the scanning window press and then to initiate direct to operation to the tx vor distance of nm to the tx vor the kln will give the following message required select obs this message provides reminder that to fly course reversal the obs mode needs to be selected note from the approach chart that there is opt arrival sector for this approach if you are approach ing tx within the indicated area there is no need to perform course reversal and you need to ignore this message the opt sector is not stored in the data base so it is not possible for the kln to know if course reversal is required or not as result the kln will always give this message whenever way point could be used for course reversal the kln will properly sequence to the fa to map leg and transition to the approach mode when nm from the iaf however you are approaching from any other direction course reversal is required and the obs mode will need to be selected if the obs mode is not selected before reaching tx then the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach point this is not desirable when performing course reversal so the obs mode must be selected before reaching tx the kln will only remind you to select obs mode if the iaf is the active way point therefore if course reversal is required make sure the iaf is the selected way point pilot guide approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and sid and sid course reversal is required then upon reaching tx perform the appropriate holding pattern entry and set the inbound course on the external cdi or hsi in this example the inbound course is at this point the kln works very similar to con vent ion al vor established on the inbound course of switch back to the leg mode when leg mode is selected the fa is automat cally made the active way point when the iaf and the fa are at the same way point is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the fa as the active way point before crossing the fa to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale factor the cdi scale fac tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the fa delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor change this will make the transition more abrupt if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active mode the aircraft is nm from the fa the kln will verify that the proper integrity is available if integrity monitoring is available for the approach then the kln will change to the approach active mode this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to nm reaching tx the kln will automatically sequence to rw the missed approach point fix at dme from tx along the final approach course is not included in the way points that come from the data base since the distance that the kln is giving you is distance to the map you will need to mentally figure out when the aircraft has reached this point is done by looking at the along track distances given in the plan view of the approach in this case the fix is nm from rw upon reaching this distance you can descend to the md for this approach missed approach is required for this approach then the following steps would be required published missed approach procedure for this approach is to make climbing left turn to feet and proceed direct to the tx vor in this case tx will be the default direct to way point kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid is pressed this is the desired way point so press to confirm the way point and proceed direct to the vor if atc gives you instructions for missed approach that are different from the published missed approach procedure it is always possible for you to select different direct to way point than the default direct to way point the aircraft approaches tx you will need to select obs mode to stop way point sequencing and define the inbound course for the holding pattern if you do not select the obs mode before the aircraft is within nm of the holding point then the kln presents message reminding you to select the obs mode note another attempt at the approach is desired after holding itis necessary to manually change the active way point when the fa and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active way point to the fa when you change from obs to leg make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active mode example approach radar vectors for this example we will use the same approach that was used in the previous section except this approach will be conducted with the help of radar vectors from approach control the aircraft will be assumed to be arriving from the west although this does not change the way the approach will be flown using the kln approach has been selected and entered into the flight plan and the aircraft is going direct to kc vn new mexico municipal as described in section soon as atc mentions radar vectors you should immediately start to think of the obs mode once given radar vectors change the active way point to tx and select the obs mode note that it is not important what order these events take place it is just as effective to change to obs mode and then change the active way point as it is to change the active way point and then switch to obs mode change the selected course on the cdi or hsi to the final approach course for this exam ple the inbound course is is now possible to watch your progress on the nav page and anticipate when you will be given new headings to fly established on the inbound course you will need to change back to the leg mode to allow for proper approach operation and automatic leg sequencing for best performance the change back to leg mode should be made before the aircraft is nm from the fa it is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the fa as the active way point before crossing the fa to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale factor the cdi scale fac tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the fa delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor change this will make the transition more abrupt if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active mode rest of this approach would be flown using the same steps as presented in section and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln pilot guide approaches and sid

nabb vor passing the nabb vor you are told to expect the vor approach at lou you load the approach using the procedure described in section the distance from the present position to the destination airport reaches nm the kln will automatically arm the approach mode the cdi scale factor will transition to nm and the kln will provide more sensitive integrity monitoring you also press to update the barometric information the aircraft is nm from the qm vor the kln will give message reminding you to select the obs mode the obs mode is required for the procedure turn after passing qm select the outbound course of the external cdi or hsi aircraft is now headed outbound for the procedure turn as soon practical you will need to change the active way point to ff the final approach fix this is done by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning until ff is displayed in the win dow then pressing then pressing the obs course will still be what is select ed on the external cdi or hsi the obs mode selected and ff as the active way point it is possible to fly the procedure turn allow enough distance past ff to complete the procedure turn and still be nm away before reaching the fa after completing the outbound portion of the procedure turn change the selected course to the inbound course of the external cdi or hsi established on the inbound course the leg mode will again need to be selected so that proper approach operation and way point sequencing will occur is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the fa as the active way point before crossing the fa to activate the

kln will change to the approach active mode this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to nm way point alerting will occur as the aircraft passes the final approach fix the leg from the final approach fix to the missed approach point will become active and the cdi scale factor will remain at nm if the auto scale factor was selected on the nav page then the scale factor will zoom in on the airport as the aircraft gets closer and closer to the missed approach point eventually the map scale changes to nm following steps are followed if missed approach is required missed approach instructions call for climbing left turn to heading of intercepting the course to the missed approach holding fix scum to fly this with the kln it will be necessary to put the kln into the obs mode and make scum the active way point change the selected course on the external cdi or hsi to the aircraft reaches scum you will need to perform holding pattern entry suitable for this holding pattern and set the selected course to the holding pattern example approach dme arc dme arc procedures with the kln are completely different from using traditional vor and dme equipment don worry though because dme arc procedures using the kln are also easier than using traditional equipment this is because the kln pro vide left guidance around the arc no more having to watch distance in one place and radial in another being vectored dme arc is really whole bunch of initial approach fixes placed one next to each other to form an arc very rarely do you actually fly to the beginning of an arc especially in radar environment instead the flight path of the aircraft generally intersects the arc at some point once the aircraft is near the arc it is then possible to turn so that the arc distance is maintained until time to turn to the inbound fix following example will show how dme arc procedures are flown using the kln this example approach will be to use the vor rwy approach to owatonna minnesota kow the approach plate for this approach is in figure assume that the aircraft is approaching from the north and is in radar environment assigns the vor rwy approach turn to the apt page for kow to select the approach you select the vor approach and the kln pre sents the iaf selection page are five choices for the iaf three of these choices you can recognize but the other two and are un amil ar and not shown on this chart these two way points are the data base identifiers for the ends of the arc means dme arc point is the radial on which the way point lies and indi cates the distance of the arc is the twelfth letter of the alphabet so the indicates that this is dme arc in similar manner can also be decoded in this example the aircraft is approaching from the north so the iaf will be selected kln knows that this point is associated with dme arc once an arc way point is chosen the kln determines what radial of the reference vor the aircraft is presently located on way point is created that is located at the intersection of the pre sent radial and the dme arc this way point is the first way point in the list of way points presented on the apt page before loading approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the approach into the flight plan this way point is

and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure caution the kln does not take into account the geom try of the active flight plan when determining the arc intercept point this point is defined solely on the present radial and the defined arc distance from the reference vor for this reason it is better to delay selecting approaches that contain dme arcs until the aircraft is closer to the destination the cursor over add to pl press the approach will be loaded into the active flight plan just like any other approach would be the approach is loaded into the flight plan the kln may give the message pts in pl edit en route pts as necessary this message is given because very often it will be necessary toed it the active flight plan to ensure that proper way point seq enc ing occurs examine the flight plan and if practical observe the nav page to make sure that the sequence of way points does not have any unnecessary legs in it kln will now provide guidance to the arc intercept point the nav page displays the entire arc on the screen the por tion that is between the beginning of the arc and the arc intercept is drawn with dashed line the part that is between the arc inter ept point and the end of the arc is drawn with the normal solid line some cases atc may provide radar vectors to the arc the kln provides means to define new intercept point based on the current track of the aircraft over the ground this can be done from either the nav page or from the pl page the dashed line displayed on the nav page will help you to deter mine if atc is giving you correct vectors the nav page pull out the right inner knob to bring up the way point scanning window the right inner knob until the first way point of the arc is displayed in this example for

the current desired track is greater than dme arcs have defined radials that serve as step down fixes these points are not stored in the data base to help you determine your position relative to these step points along the arc the kln will display new value in the bottom right corner of the display on the nav page this new bit of inform tion is denoted by the letters arc followed by three numbers three numbers represent the current radial that you are on relative to the reference vor the arc radial is forced into this position when the aircraft is nm from the arc the arc display is shown in figure just watch this value and when it reads the same as one of the step points you can descend as necessary this particular example does not have such points but there are quite few approaches that do pilot guide approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and sid and sid performance may not be satisfactory if coupled in the nav mode while flying the arc

there will be problem with the integrity of the gps sy tem while you are conducting non approaches with the kln in some cases the kln will determine that there will not be sufficient integrity monitoring for the leg between the fa and the map or aim is not currently available in these cases the kln will not go into the approach active mode and will present the follow ing message not

prediction destination way point will by default be the missed approach point of an approach loaded in the flight plan if there is no approach in the flight plan then the default way point is the last way point in the active flight plan of course it is possible for you to enter any way point in this field time used for the aim prediction will be the current eta to the destination airport or the map this time is automatically updated by the kln so there is usually no need to enter value if you are making aim calculation for planning purposes it is also possible to enter time in this field an important point about this time is that the time used for aim prediction is always in the future and limited to hours from the present time for example if the time is now and the time entered for the eta is then the prediction will be made for the next day not one hour ago pilot guide approaches and sid and sid to perform manual aim calculation the left outer and inner knobs to select the th page

terminal arrival routes by sid name sid procedures stored in the data base can only be considered accurate as long as the data base is current even though the data base contains sid and star procedures there is lot of information that is not included in the data base therefore the paper chart is still the primary source of information for example many procedures require the aircraft to fly to certain altitude along heading until intercepting course and many other procedures that the kln can not automatically accomplish many procedures require pilot action to ensure that the proper path is flown over the ground the main purpose of loading sid or star into the active flight plan is to provide you with quick way of loading potentially large number of way points and star procedures can be as challenging to fly as some approaches are therefore it is mandatory that you are comfortable with the operation of the kln before attempting to fly sid and star procedures in particular flight plan operation and the obs mode should be second nature to you note are some sid procedures in the world that are not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base and therefore the way points that make up these procedures would have to be entered manually it is good preflight practice ensure that the kln con tains anticipated procedures for the flight and star procedures are stored with the airport for which they apply sid and star procedures are accessed through the apt page if there are both sid and stars for given airport then there will be two apt pages one to select sid and the other to select star this is indicated by apt it is also possible to have only sid or only star in which case there is only one apt

flight plan in section will be used remember that was selected meaning that the procedure is applicable to both runways and the fellows transition was also selected this procedure is one of the more difficult that you are likely to come across most procedures are not this difficult but this sid serves as good example for what steps to take when you encounter difficult procedure fly this procedure use the following steps and refer to the chart for this sid the sid as described in section procedure states and proceed via sfo the dme fix at or above to accomplish this por of the sid put the kln into the obs mode with sfo as the active way point and make selected course it is easiest to accomplish these steps before take sfo is the way point that is dme from the sfo vort ac and thein bound course to this fix after take climb to as required by the sid the aircraft reaches sfo turn left to heading of this point it is necessary to manually change the active way point to this is done easily from either the nav page or from the pl page in either case once porte is highlighted by the cursor press to bring up the direct top age to confirm porte as the direct to way point the selected course on the hsi or cdi to the new value of as required by the sid continue flying heading of the hsi or cdi needle centers and then fly to keep the needle centered and fly to porte and sid and sid kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid reaching porte change back to the leg mode to enable automatic way point sequencing once the aircraft reaches porte the kln will automatically sequence to the next way point esca passing esca the procedure calls for until intercepting the to wages intersection to do this with the kln change back to the obs mode and make sure that wages is the active way point set the selected course to reaching wages change to the leg mode this will allow automatic way point sequencing upon reaching wages is an altitude restriction marked with an on the chart the name of this point is means that the way point is nm from the fl vor make sure to meet any alti tude requirements upon reaching this way point the aircraft reaches fl proceed on with the rest of the flight plan as required example of star procedure to illustrate the use of the kln with star procedures the steps required to fly acton four arrival to dallas worth international will be shown in this section this procedure is considerably simpler than the sid example shown in section for this example assume that the aircraft departs from el paso texas and files for the acton four arrival with the wink transition use the fol lowing steps to fly this procedure with the kln and refer to the chart for this star the star into the flight plan as described in section star is very simple and the kln will automatically guide the aircraft along the proper route until the qn vor before reaching qn examine this procedure and notice that there are two different routes depending on what type of air craft is flying the star turbojets fly to creek intersection while non fly to rend intersection the data base in the kln has the sequence of way points for the turbojet procedure not the sequence for non is extremely rare to have different path over the ground for turbojets and non but be sure to cross check with your paper charts and sid and sid if the aircraft you are flying in is turbojet then fly the rest of the star as depicted on the chart with no changes to the flight plan if the aircraft is not turbojet then follow these steps to the pl page and delete the following way points mark um

example is the same as is the same as conversions appendix appendix gps primer background the global positioning system is satellite navigation system that was originally conceived and implemented by the united states department of defense the system is however avail able to all civilian users free of charge gps provides extremely precise position velocity and time information satellites are not geosynchronous as is the case with many weather and television satellites that is each satellite is not above fixed spot on the earth all the time but rather is continuously moving across the sky in fact each satellite completely orbits the earth two times per day department of defense imposes an intentional accuracy de gra of the gps system this degradation is known as selective availability when sa is active only military users have access to full gps accuracy for civilian users position accuracy is degraded to no worse than meters at the time of this writing selective availability is on therefore accuracy is degraded near ly of the time position determining concept the technique used to determine position is fundamentally very sim the complicated part is accounting for and correcting all the possible errors in the position gps receiver is able to determine the time it takes radio signal to travel from the satellite to the gps antenna since this radio signal travels at the speed of light statute miles per second the time delay can very easily be used to determine the receiver distance from given satellite if measurements are taken from four satellites three satellites and an input from an aircraft altimeter the receiver can identify its position very precisely pilot guide appendix primer appendix for example the gps receiver might determine that it is exactly miles from satellite miles from satellite and miles from satellite at the same time the aircraft en cod altimeter might be indicating an altitude of feet msl there is only one point in space that satisfies these four measurements data signals two of the primary types of signals that the gps satellites broadcast are almanac and ephemeris data these signals enable the gps receiver to quickly lock on to the satellites in view otherwise the receiver would have to look for each of the satellites to determine which ones could be used data is very crude data which describes the approximate orbital position of the satellites each of the satellites transmits the almanac data for all satellites so gps receiver has only to listen to one satellite in order to know which satellites are the sky at that particular time almanac data is good for about six months so when you turn the receiver off then back on month later it will know what satellites to look for data is very precise data which each satellite transmits to tell the gps receiver exactly where it is and what its orbital para me ter will be for about the next four hours each satellite transmits its own unique ephemeris data ff primer appendix nm nm nm ft msl not to calen gps system segments the gps system is composed of three segments the space segment the control segment and the user segment space segment consists of the nav star satellites which orbit the earth at an altitude of nautical miles the satellite orbits are very precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the gps system hours day every day there are almost always more than six satellites in view from anywhere on earth control segment consists of network of ground monitor and control stations the master control station is located in colorado springs colorado all satellite data which is collected by the other ground stations is assimilated and analyzed at colorado springs based on these analyses ephemeris updates as sy tem clock corrections are sent to the satellites through radio transmitters at the ground stations these ground stations are located at kwajalein of hawaii in the central pacific ocean diego garcia the indian ocean and ascension the south atlantic ocean an owner of gps system you can now claim to be certified member of the gps user segment gps has many users and uses and more are being dreamed up all the time not only are aircraft using gps navigation so are military systems and personnel boaters hikers and surveyors personal automobiles and transport trucks use intelligent transportation systems or its to find their destinations and track their movements some biologists attach gps receivers to animals to monitor their movement and migration patterns geologists even use gps to track the movement of lac ers and to analyze plate tectonics of the earth crust an exciting new technology as we move into the century autonomous integrity monitoring is function that every ifr gps receiver must continuously perform to assure an accurate position one characteristic of the gps space and control segments is that they can instantly fix satellite if it begins sending misleading positioning information for this reason gps receiver can rely on the gps satellites to tell it when there is pos error the words autonomous indicate that the gps kln pilot guide appendix primer appendix receiver on it own can detect an inaccuracy in the gps system it does this by using distance measurements from as many satellites as possible to check the consistency of the position is called an over position solution there are not enough satellites in view to assure the position in te gri the kln notifies the pilot five measurements with good geometry positions of the satellites are needed to provide aim this means that at least five satellites or four satellites and pressure altitude input from the aircraft altimeter are required to assure aim availability likewise if this check shows some in con sistency in the position the kln notifies the user that other navigation sources should be used to cross the position additionally sometimes the receiver is unable to assure the position to enough accuracy for the phase of flight due to the location of the satellites at that instant availability is very seldom difficulty when in the en route and terminal phases of navigation the allowable limits are much tighter when non approach is performed with kln for this reason the kln other page allows the pilot to enter time and location and the gps receiver will predict if aim will be available to shoot the non approach see section for more information about the aim prediction capability press receiver the kln and kln use an honeywell gps receiver known as the gps press it was dubbed this way because it is ident cal in size to an everyday credit card and its faster acquisition time than previous single designs the gps receiver has eight parallel channels which means each channel can continuously track satellite for continuous tracking of up to eight gps satellites the parallel receiver design has several advantages performance during high dynamic conditions and acceleration position acquisition time known as time over single designs position accuracy ability of the gps receiver to perform the aim calc ula tion is enhanced without degrading position tracking

detail in appendix is recommended by eas as the minimum for initial type rating qualification training and checking as well as for the relevant portion of conversion training and checking the course was verified to fulfill the requirements of jar amc in an acceptable way this type rating training course is an intense and demanding course additional training should be considered for pilots without any previous experience with efis and fms the safe operation of the airplane is predicated upon the awareness at all times and of both pilots of the airplane flight modes and flight parameters strict adherence to crew coordination procedures in normal as well as in abnormal situations is essential and should be regarded as mandatory these ccp specific to aircraft type and to operator should be fully integrated in the training the training organization therefore should be made aware of the specific crew coordination procedures as established by the operator before training is started pilots having no relevant experience with the app li cation of crew coordination proc dures will benefit from bridge course on this topic pilots having no relevant experience with the operation of an integrated avionics flight management system and flight guidance system like the collins pr suite will benefit from bridge on this topic these specific additional courses should ideally be completed before the full flight simulator training phase emergency procedures are an essential part of the training curriculum to avoid confusion during training as well as during actual operations the training organization and the candidate pilots need to be made aware of the items to be performed without immediate reference to the checklist these steps should be defined before training is started preferably by the operator as part of its standard operating procedures further areas of special emphasis are covered in separate paragraph eas recommends to include line flying under supervision in the conversion training program and to follow the requirements of eu including appendix training and checking and eu as commander checking ground school examination and type rating skill test have to

the joe recommends early exposure to the fcp fm and fms especially for pilots with no previous efis or fms experience establishing ear ly confidence in manually flying the aircraft converting from manual to automatic controlled flight mode and back is equally important due to heavy reliance on the automatic flight control system in the event of flight path deviation due to input error or system malfunction the flight crew must be able to comfortably transition from automatic to manual mode and back in an orderly fashion european aviation safety agency aviation authorities joint operational evaluation board gulf stream issue september recurrent training recurrent training and currency serve to maintain pilot continued competency for the operational tasks to be performed during proficiency checks this competency is established it is every operator responsibility to establish recurrent training and proficiency checking program approved by the national authority which is relevant to the type of airplane and the intended operation the requirements for recurrent training program may vary with several factors which have significant influence some of these factors are actu al exposure of the flight crew member specific routes and aerodromes used by the operator and new developments in technology these factors and combination thereof will determine how much recurrent training will actually be required it is recommended to follow the requirements of eu subpart paragraph as minimum and to consider expansion as appropriate of these requirements for pilots

for those who require an understanding of the problem brief overview of how the project research and analysis were conducted and list of the significant findings and recommendations readers and front line managers who may need or want more details of the problem research and analysis and complete listing of findings and recommendations can refer to the full report that follows the go noncompliance problem approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for aviation accidents accounting annually for approximately percent of all accidents flight safety foundation study of years of runway excursions determined that percent could have been avoided with decision to go around in other words percent of all accidents could potentially be prevented by going around it is generally felt that an unstable approach is the primary cause of landing excursions however within this period just over half of the landing excur followed fully stable approach in these instances the flight became unstable only during landing critical industry policy designed to help prevent such accidents is the go policy interestingly and sadly the collective industry performance of complying with go policies is extremely poor approximately percent of unstable approaches result in go policy compliance why is critical policy designed to prevent the most common type of accident ignored by flight crews and why is that policy not being managed effectively by management improving the go compliance rate holds tremendous potential in re approach and landing accidents the go itself is not without risk there is an increased risk in loss of control events during go compared to exposure with all other phases of flight it follows that we should only go around when the risk associated with an unstable approach is greater than the risk associated with go what is that balance and how do we minimize go exposure to only those that are really necessary the flight safety foun go decision making and execution project was launched to research and answer the question are we so poor at complying with established go policies it was also intended to improve our understanding of the risks associated with executing go and to make re com to improve compliance and mitigate risks assoc with the go maneuver itself the full report includes complete research analysis find strategies and recommendations for industry corrective action and future work required as such it is meant as source for the development of easier operator refer products such as guidelines and checklists research and analysis many alas have been investigated thoroughly over time and much is known about contributing factors what is lacking however is an understanding of the psychology of noncom pli research and analysis of go decision making have been conducted primarily from the psychosocial science perspective to gain an understanding of the psychological drivers of noncompliance and to identify corrective steps that can be taken based on science this is the first industry anal of its type for this specific problem the presage group conducted the research and analysis based on its situational model of nine distinct constructs or attributes from two global studies via web surveys one survey analyzed the psychology of noncompliance by flight crew members and the other examined the psychology of management actions in handling company go policies detailed analysis can be found in the full report for the go execution research an accident and incident review was conducted that included non selection of published accident and serious incident re about go events involving transport category aircraft between and total of go events were included in some the safety of the go was central to the accident or incident investigation in th the aftermath of the go was the main purpose of the investigation the events involved single jets percent twin turboprops percent and twin jets percent the context safety aspects and overall level of risk of each event were analyzed and characterized by review team each event was assigned to one of three categories according to the degree of risk presented by the go high risk events moderate risk events and non events in the two risk categories six go safety issues were identified with respect to the init ia and conduct of each go most of the risk bearing events were associated with single gas but five events were associated with two gas is each risk event also was assigned one of three risks loss of control flight controlled flight into terrain or midair collision significant findings an effective policy has three main attributes it is well thought out and clearly written to balance the needs of safety and accomplishment company management handles the policy consistently and company front line employees aware is such that the policy is carried out reliably research revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the industry operator and employee levels high significant findings are the collective industry norm is to accept the noncom pli of go polices despite empirical data that indicate this is the most common contributor to alas the industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable approaches as the sole means to reduce alas even though empirical data show that unstable approaches affect less than half of runway excursions pilots overall awareness of ala risks and of the impact those risks have on approach and landing safety is low management is generally disengaged from go noncompliance and has low awareness of the impact it has on alas management perception of risk is low pilots do not see current go policy criteria as realistic for the operational environment effective go decision making in flight deck com muni cation is low go although considered normal flight man eu are rare as reported by flight crews one in go has potentially hazardous outcome such as an aircraft per for exceed ance there are variable go techniques and challenges depending on the point during the approach when the go around begins procedures and training do not adequately address many of these challenges pilot experience in the aircraft type affects go proficiency go complexity including complex controller radio transmissions can affect go proficiency recommendations it is evident that the state of noncompliance has been steady for many years and will remain steady unless changes are made first and foremost the industry must improve its awareness of the problem shift in focus and cultural norms is required it is believed that significant improvement is attainable however the cultural shift will be easier if the industry shifts collectively as opposed to individual comp attacking the issue on their own as several are already doing as stated above three key attributes of an effective policy are the policy makes operational sense to both the employees who execute it and those who manage it the policy is managed effectively to level that satisfies company objectives and the employees who should follow the policy are very aware of that policy and the environment in which it is applied as such the following recommendations touch upon these key attributes more detailed recommendations can be found in the full report high strategic recommendations for go decision making include the following ensure the policy makes sense operationally update the stable approach definition and stable ap height to maximize their relevance among flight crews and their manageability among management separate the stable approach definition and criteria from decision criteria to improve aware that these are two distinct aspects of go policies and that decision making is viable beyond the defined approach phase this separation does not imply that these two distinct areas cannot meet at points throughout the approach and landing rather it is intended for developers of standard operating pro ce dures and communication procedures to break the psychological attachment of these two aspects manage the policy effectively operators set specific compliance rate targets performance indicators and establish initiatives to achieve them amend industry and regulatory audit programs to include standards and recommended practices that address go noncompliance increase situational awareness increase awareness of gan and risks associated with continuing to land when unstable and the significant impact that noncompliance has on alas among operator management ii flight crews iii industry and pilot associations regulators and manufacturers enhance situational awareness aware to heighten flight crews awareness throughout the approach and landing through policy and procedural enhancements communication improvements and iii minimizing the subjectivity of go decision making for the decision maker the pilot flying or captain to mitigate those components of situ awareness that compromise the pilot risk assessment and decision ability each recommendation helps improve the psychological riv that affect good decision making and it is this obj ec that the recommendations were specifically designed to address although all strategic recommendations are important and should be implemented as part of holistic approach few are worth highlighting first if an operator has the means to install automated stable approach and land alerting systems it should be priority these systems address many of the psychological issues associated with noncompliance and could be the single most effective way to improve go decisions second management must be more involved in managing the policy an area where management has been very much absent key steps to be taken by management are to set go compliance rate targets consistent with safety management system prin and to investigate and follow up on each approach that continues to an unstable landing finally flight crew situational awareness needs to be improved primarily through better communication throughout the approach and landing which can be achieved largely through active communication techniques as part of standard opera procedures high strategic go execution recommendations ensure that go training and awareness appro pri reflect different go execution risk scenarios review go policy procedures and ocu men to maximize their effectiveness clarity and understanding ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitoring during approach landing and go as with any significant program change desired and undesired effects should be closely monitored by appro pri audit programs such as flight data analysis line operations safety audits or international air trans association operational safety audits action taken in light of the findings and recommendations it is appar that revisions are required to flight safety foundation elements of stabilized approach and safe landing guidelines analysis indicates there are facets of that guidance that are not optimal for effective decision making and that may encourage go for approaches that may be of very low risk when this report was being published the analysis for such revisions had already taken place but the project review committee recommended an operational trial before changes in the foundation guidelines are formally adopted appendices and for flight safety foun stabilized approach and go guidelines for industry validation and safe landing guidelines for industry validation project conclusion report the problem of go policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the greatest threat to flight safety today and the po impact of improvement in compliance is significant no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go around the industry must improve its awareness of the problem to accomplish that shift in focus and cultural norms is required it is believed that significant improvement is attain however the cultural shift will be much easier if the in shifts collectively as opposed to individual companies taking individual action however several companies already have chosen to go it alone on this issue the project accomplished the goals of the document that outlined the terms of flight safety foundation go safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight crew members and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight managers and to consider the safety risk assoc with go and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of the report not all envisioned products have been completed however and this is noted in the report as work yet to be done by flight safety foundation background curtis william ia meeting boeing seattle presentation in flight safety foundation international advisory committee was briefed about concerns that go around often were not being conducted when an unstable approach occurred below the stable approach height the ensuing discussion concluded in agreement that the issue should be studied further interestingly the foundation eu advisory committee began its own discussion related to go the lack of unstable approach policy compliance the risk of the go maneuver itself and what effect air traffic services providers could have on the issue these discussions led the foundation to look more deeply into the empirical data supporting such concerns failure to conduct go is the number one risk factor in approach and landing accidents and the number one cause of runway excursions the year in review recent analyses of data from through indicate that percent of all accidents are runway excursions and that they are the most common type of accident the year in review unstable approaches occur on to percent of all approaches and to percent of flight crews whose airplanes are in this state continue the approach to landing the year in review evidence based training in of approach and landing accidents and serious incidents one of several studies conducted by flight safety foundation approach and landing accident reduction task force and published by the foundation in the task force con an in analysis of accidents and incidents that occurred from through the task force found that go was initiated in only percent of the occurrences and said that the evidence analysts expected the initiation of higher number of go in practice safety foundation alar task force approximately percent of all accidents are alas curtis one analysis concluded that more than percent of alas would have been preventable if the crew had decided to go around the year in review simply calculated potentially about half of all accidents could be prevented with decision to go around no other single de can have such an impact on the overall aviation accident rate although all of these studies are somewhat subjective the consistencies from study to study indicate the problem is real and is of the magnitude the studies indicate clearly go around decision can yield great benefits but what about the risks associated with the go maneuver itself there is no shortage of informative studies that have ana what occurred during alas and what factors contrib to the accidents however no known study has examined flight crew decision making from psychological perspective to determine why some crews continued with an unstable approach knowingly violating company policies and why th elected to go around what are the drivers of intentional noncompliance with critical safety policy the alar task force analysis of approach and landing accidents and serious incidents identified professional judgment decision making as the most re casual factor occurring in percent of the events another form of poor decision making or continuing an approach when conditions suggest otherwise accounted for percent of all occurrences safety foundation alar task force more questions arise about the actions or inactions of company management in these events if the data have been consistent for many years why have managers not been able to correct the problem with such low industry compliance rate some basic questions about management role need to be answered are they aware of the noncompliance rates and if so then why have they been unable to mitigate or improve compliance with established go policies if they are not concerned with the poor compliance rate why not man issues were not cited in any of the conclusions of the alar task force final of fatal approach and landing accidents however in the task force conclusions of related study of approach and landing ac and serious incidents management fail was identified as circumstantial factor in percent of the occurrences safety foundation alar task force based on these analyses better awareness of the problem and new questions flight safety foundation initiated the go decision and execution project it was designed as joint ea project with each committee focusing on one specific aspect of the issue the ia focused on go decision making and the ea focused on the performance of the go go decision making flight crew methodology and information collection the presage group was commissioned by flight safety foun to conduct research and analysis on the psychology of factors contributing to intentional noncompliance the basis for much of the following comes from two studies conducted by presage one that analyzed the psychology of

although the issue extends beyond unstable approaches the studies were conducted on this phase of flight as data were readily attainable from flight crews psychological survey was developed that used unique questioning and experimental methodologies to understand the causation of compliant versus noncompliant flight crew go decision making these techniques included assess pilots experiences using series of questions designed to explore the psychological precursors of risk assessment and decision making second survey was designed to assess the perceptions beliefs and experiences of airline man ag and safety and operational personnel regarding unstable approaches and how they are managed at their host comp to fully understand the systemic roots and dynamics of noncompliance with unstable approach policies across the industry the results of the managers study were compared with those of the parallel flight crew study flight crew event recall study segmentation in this segment of the study we asked pilots to recall recent specific instances of unstable approaches at or below sah we asked for the last instance they had experienced this special recall task elicited detailed descriptions of their experiences during the minutes leading up to and including decision on whether to call for go these experiences include subjective aspects their situational and risk assessments

their resulting psychological states during the critical time interval leading up to the decisions states that were hypothesized to be the highly important precursors of those decisions in addition to help refine the analysis pilots also reported variety of basic demographic information rank time on type base of operations etc and flight operational characteristics haul versus short haul operations aircraft type etc the content of the entire survey was thoroughly reviewed commented upon and amended in accordance with the recommendations made by members of the ia and ea and other expert advisory team members the pilots were divided into groups those who only experienced continuing to land with an unstable approach group those who only experienced go group and those who had experienced both go and unstable approach events pilots in this group were randomly as to one of two groups to recall scenario in which they had flown an unstable approach but did not call for go or to recall go event this random experimental assignment allowed us to conf identify objective and psychological situational factors associated with noncompliance with go policies re go decision making pilots who reported they had only flown go or an unstable approach recently in the last five years recalled their last event of those respective types the main set of psychological and psychosocial factors assessed was

operationally compliant decision making pilot go thresholds study segmentation second experiment was included in this survey and we report some findings below but the details are too nu mer to fully describe here this experiment was designed to uncover the environmental and physical instability param that influence pilots perceptions of the risks inherent in flying unstable approaches and to examine when their attention to these parameters affects their judgments about when to call for go in this study pilots were pre with hypothetical flight scenario in which they were randomly assigned to receive variations in the severity of the risk associated with wind conditions runway conditions braking action and runway length they were then asked at what degree of deviation on five different flight parameters those variations would cause them to call for go pilots were instructed to report on their likelihood of calling for go based on their own personal risk criteria not those of their companies or of the industry on this set of five flight parameters and to do so at different altitudes this allowed us to infer where on the flight path different risk factors become personally salient and important as drivers of pilots judgments to go around and how these factors might interact the objective was to determine whether there was basic alignment between pilots perce about when there is need to call for go and general company policies about when these instabilities necessitate such decision in case of evidence of any gaps between these two our goal was to use these data to guide realistic recommendations about changes in policy that might bring them into alignment while ensuring that safety would not be compromised to the extent that pilots do not see current policies as constituting set of legitimately unsafe conditions they are likely to ignore such standard opera procedures and engage in potentially riskier noncom pli flight behaviors this was an experimentally based attempt to explore pilot perceptions of what should constitute the conditions to go around in their experienced judgment and to begin to develop view about whether such beliefs could be or should be incorporated into policy guidance and sops in way that would help ensure compliant safe behavior pilot respondent sampling respondents to this survey were solicited through direct communication with safety personnel at various pilot ass and fsf and non airlines globally as well as through various social media forums the goal was to invite and administer the online survey to as many pilots as possible from around the world representing variety of fleets aircraft flight operations respondent experience levels cultures physical geographies and so on anonym was assured to

policy as well as those responsible for day quality control of flight op series of questions regarding their views of the safety practices procedures and organizational cultures with which unstable approaches and go occur in their own airline operations specifically we asked such managers about the rates of compliance with unstable approach policies that they believed their airlines experienced as well as the compliance rates experienced by the commercial industry as whole beyond this basic knowledge we asked whether they were satisfied with their airline performance on comp li with their unstable approach policies and procedures and whether they thought them effective about their perceptions of the clarity and appropriateness of these policies and procedures about their beliefs that they had the support support and organizational approval to manage their company go rates and about their overall assessment of how urgently they believed that the risks any perceived in their go rates needed to be addressed at all the content of the entire survey was thoroughly reviewed commented upon and amended in ac with the recommendations made by members of the ia the ea and other expert

several caveats are explained below in fact the distributions by gender continent and language in the managers sample were nearly identical to those in the pilots sample while few directors completed the survey there were sizeable number of mid and senior managers in the sample however subsequent question about respondents roles and responsibilities within their airlines for re com and leading

development or implementation the considerable efforts that we made in our outreach and engagement strategy for the survey garnered unique visits to the survey portal we consider this number of hits to be very good indicating that the engagement strategy drove meaningful number of airline managers to the site however of those visiting only percent completed the survey response rate low in both absolute terms and relative to the rate of participation among pilots percent who were asked to complete much longer and more demanding survey this low response rate constitutes we believe the first evidence pointing toward disengagement with the topic of unstable approach policy and procedures among airline flight operations personnel at the managerial level this is especially true when we consider that the original criterion for inclusion in our final analysis stipulated that respondents must be in position to develop and influence unstable approach go policies and procedures at their airlines by virtue of their authority to recommend or make changes based on this inclusion criterion and an analysis of respondents self reported roles and responsibilities we achieved sample of only qualified re spon to increase the sample size for analysis we widened the sample frame to include those respondents responsible for quality control of day flight operations at their airlines even if they did not have policy development responsibilities thorough comparison of the latter group with the original target revealed no systematic differences in their survey responses justifying their inclusion in the final sample the study therefore reports the results from managers per of all survey respondents and percent of survey site visitors this low response rate essen disallowed us from analyzing data for second experimental task of determining personal go around thresholds for unstable approach risk among managers similar to the pilots go threshold experiment meanwhile in light of the low response rate caveat must be issued for all other results that we report below that is because the normative response to the survey invitation among managers worldwide was to choose not to participate therefore we must question whether this was valid and reliable sample of managers that said the results although based on this small sample are highly suggestive of trends in managers perspectives on unstable approach policies and procedures while we are unsure if the sample is in fact biased our intuition tells us that any sample bias if present would tend toward having surveyed managers who are more engaged aware and concerned about the issue than those who are less so if this is true these results may more likely over the degree of awareness and concern about unstable approach around noncompliance that exists in the industry industry sensing throughout the project there have been numerous dis with operators regulators manufacturers and bodies and conference and meeting present with follow conversations off accounts from agencies not wishing to be identified indicate that of those that have tracked go compliance rates are in the range of those discussed above to percent and that they have been in that range for protracted period of time the exceptions are couple of airlines that indicated their go around compliance rates approach percent additionally they say that their flight data acquisition programs are set to report out when the number of stable approach parameter exceed ance is greater than one the federal aviation administration aviation safety

condition or unstable approach because they had recently experienced only that one type of event findings from comparison of these groups are conservative and represent situationally important factors associated with go decision making not pilot dispositional factors however pilot tendencies and preferences associated with flying unstable approaches are of course present in the aviation community and we will also point out in the data how such pilot di sposi factors may additionally contribute to noncompliance with go sops it is our belief that the best way to present the findings is to describe how pilots noncompliant behavior is function of decision process influenced by the in aircraft and environmental factors that shape pilots decisions their situational awareness competencies in encoding and inter the cues they receive about these aircraft and env factors their personal perceptions of risk and risk tolerance that result and their appetite for appropriate col conversation about risk during the approach as an input to decision making it is from both the pilots responses within each of these four classes of variables as well as the interactions between the two pilots that complete de scrip psychological profile for noncompliance emerges pilot situational awareness profile situational awareness of his or her environment in all its facets is the psychological prerequisite for pilot to judge risk and then to make decision to maintain compliance and safety in light of that judgment this study used the pre group situational awareness model for measuring and interpreting the psychological and social factors that col make up situational awareness recall that within this model situational awareness comprises nine distinct but interconnected and seamless aspects of awareness much of our discussion will be framed around how each of these aspects influences pilot decision processes singly and in concert with one another to remain compliant rather than noncompliant note in passing that the presage model classifies with an average percent accuracy whether pilots are describing an unstable approach and landing or go percent for unstable approaches and percent for go based only on its psychosocial measurements and excluding any knowledge of the objective factors present in the unstable approach scenarios reported this means that our assessment of the experience of aware as we have measured it does good job of predicting pilots decision behavior far beyond percent chance level of prediction the results of this study revealed as hypothesized that on all nine inter situational awareness factors unstable approach pilots were significantly less aware than go pilots in the moments leading up to and including their go around decision making that is they were less aware of their emotional responses to threat less able to anticipate risk more overconfident in their ability to compensate for the instability and in less agreement with company sops etc in other words the unstable approach pilots scored much lower than did the go pilots on every facet of situational awareness assessed seven of these nine differ held up statistically to the more rigorous analysis that compared just the experimentally assigned go and un approach pilots with one another and eight of the nine differences between the experimentally assigned go and unstable approach pilots were even more pronounced when comparing the ga and ua groups it is meaningful to ask does this awareness shape pilot perception of risk put simply pilot situational awareness competencies directly affect his or her perceptions and assessment of risk the lower the degree of threat that pilots associate with instability and environmental factors the perception of which is directly informed by their situ awareness the lower the significance that pilots will place on the contributing factors and the less risky they will perceive the situation to be table shows this result with unstable approach pilots reporting much lower assess of the riskiness and unmanageability of their inst bili than go pilots the spreading activation effect of situational awareness competencies we have asserted that the inter nature of the facets of situational awareness means that decline in one facet will produce rapid deleterious effect on the others this becomes clear when we consider the data relevant to this activation effect of situational awareness facets for example this cross effect is evident among the unstable approach pilot groups whose lower scores on their gut feel for threats as well as on actually seeing the threats leave them vulnerable to minimizing both their assessment of the potential threat of aircraft instability and their ability to see the threat of instability as risk to be managed correctly the natural outcome is that more unstable approach pilots are unstable at sah corollary of these lower aware scores is that unstable approach pilots also score lower in their ability to leverage crew relationships to maximize compliance and safety table shows that unstable approach pilots are more likely to minimize efforts to consider and discuss with their crew members both instability factors path deviation aircraft ref kt sink rate and land configuration and environmental factors turbulence contaminated runway and occupied runway it is the culminating effect of the aforementioned reduced awareness competencies that leaves the unstable approach pilots vulnerable to adopting mental model that minimizes the risk of instability and reduces their attention to details as the results for the instruments and equipment and the procedures indicate functional and hierarchical awareness in table unstable approach pilots are more tolerant of deviations from operational limits and procedures and less compliant with requirements that they perform all checklists and standard calls moreover as these pilots commit to continuing with an unstable approach they minimize what their professional experience could offer in executing what the sop states table note on experience or critical awareness in other words when an unstable approach pilot is not tuned into salient inform from his or her experience bank he increases the risk profile of the operation and denies himself the opportunity to correctly adjust or compensate for the operational threat table to threats or compensatory awareness the finding that unstable approach pilots more often than go pilots report being unstable at sah confirms this missed opportunity to remain compliant in concert with the former pattern is the finding that unstable approach pilots were more comfortable operating on the margins of the safety envelope example in table note the lower scores on the limits or task empirical awareness which translates to greater tolerance for risk that is seen to be manageable in table note the assessment of the instability as risky if pilot is paying less attention to his situational awareness competencies he would likely also shut himself off from avail resources such as by using interpersonal relationships to protect operational safety and remain compliant table note each other safe or relational awareness there are number of significant findings at the gran level of this construct that tell meaningful story most notable among these is that unstable approach pilots are relatively more likely than go pilots to feel crew pre to land to perceive lack of crew support for possible go decision to feel discomfort in being challenged and in challenging others and to feel inhibited about calling for go because of the authority structure in the cockpit also go pilots are about four times more likely than unstable approach pilots percent vs percent to report recalling that an individual was prompting the crew to initiate ref is reference landing speed go the evidence is clear that rather than leveraging the crew relationships as tool for safe decision making crew roles expectations and communication had suboptimal even deleterious effect finally compounding this risk profile are the findings that unstable approach pilots score lower on support for safety and that fewer than percent of unstable approach pilots believed they would be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to land while at the same time maintaining that their company criteria for when to execute go are not realistic in the end for the unstable approach pilots there is less buy to company sops and an incentive structure that or is at least not seen to discourage unstable approaches that are continued to landing these results describe situation that creates internal conflict for the unstable approach pilots at least in hindsight when they express regret for their decision to continue an unstable approach to landing specifically compared with go pilots unstable approach pilots rated their flight outcomes less positively believed less often that they had made the right decision believed much more strongly than go pilots that they should not have made the decisions they did and finally agreed more strongly that they had engaged in needless risk interpretation of results the results appear to imply conflicting message from the unstable approach pilot group on one hand unstable ap pilots regret their decisions to continue an unstable approach and land knowing that they have taken risk and yet at the same time they don believe that the company criteria for go are realistic the latter may be in part rationalization of their noncompliant decision and one that they carry forward into the next such unstable approach situation at the moment of decision the potential for noncompliant behavior based on these beliefs is very pre while the chance seems remote that pilots may anticipate post regret for not calling for go and may have that anticipation inhibit their tendency to continue the unstable approach consider the psychosocial factors affecting unstable ap pilots at the time they need to make an appropriate decision on whether to go around they have lowered sense of situational awareness across most facets which has led them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their assessment of risk further their decision process re little help from protective crew norms and processes and there is no real disincentive to fly unstable approaches the expected company response to that decision these are the ingredients of recipe for the of deviance to contaminate this component of aviation safety culture essentially this term refers to the development of normal mode of operation which is passively support tolerated and approved by its stakeholder owners management and in some cases regula once entrenched within given culture this new mode power and authority can considerably influence behavior as evidenced in the challenger and columbia space shuttle tragedies supportive evidence from the results of this study indicates that in their acceptance of the noncom normal unstable approach pilots have surrendered level of situational awareness competency that directly impacts accurate risk assessment and full compliance with sops as published in short new norms roles and incentives have come to displace some of the influence that situational awareness should have in proximity to risk assessment and decision making pilot thresholds for going around another area for discussion is the second experimental part of the survey which asked pilots to describe their risk toler thresholds for various in parameters given set of flight and environmental conditions we found that braking action vs poor had particularly large impact on pi perception of the degrees of instability that warrant call for go on the whole however pilots thresholds for calling for go varied as function of both height agl and the instability parameter they were considering as reason for going around for several of these instability fac the perceived threshold occurred well below ft agl to in particular pilots said that they should be on profile at roughly ft agl and that they could com pen for instabilities for ref and sink rate later in the decent at around ft agl in another project analysis combined data from six north american airlines international jet airlines three regional jet airlines and one regional turboprop airline that are studying this problem independently show pilot responses to the question is the lowest altitude you believe safe go could be executed from with

levels of unstable approach risk full analysis of the objective levels of risk in each event recalled by the pilots is warranted to fully explain the he of broad noncompliance with go policies and sops the inherent risks associated with the percent of unstable approaches that continue unstable can only be indirectly inferred from the present methodology based on pilot self this study mainly assessed the psycho logi characteristics and attributes in situ of pilots who choose to continue unstable approaches to landing versus those who make decisions to go around the study does not segregate the various unstable approach scenarios into classes of env presenting high or low objective risks while it is understood that not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent risk the percent of unstable approaches that are flown to completion include the highest ap and these can result in accidents in the absence of definition of the objective level of risk associated with given approach pilots have only one set of criteria one definition of the instabilities and environmental threats that are expected to trigger go choice beyond this single definition it is up to

this determination flows directly from his level and type of situational awareness and the mental models of risk he constructs based on that awareness to the extent that pilot has lowered situational awareness whether caused by acute aspects of the situation such as high workload or chronic aspects of the cultural environment such as lessened acceptance of the company go policy guidance or generally few challenges to cockpit command he will be less sensitive to relevant situational awareness cues and therefore be more likely to continue an unstable approach irrespective of the inherent objective risks associated with the approach these inadequately informed mental models of risk less accurately and sensitively represent the objective levels of the present threat as result they will not track re and will tend to produce an over of noncom decision making complete prescriptive policies vs predominately prescriptive policies complete prescriptive go policies and sops lend them to

landing distance available ref reference landing speed source the presage group for flight safety foundation and environmental threats that are expected to trigger go choice single set of criteria is often insufficient to cover all eventualities however as tony kern an aviator psychologist and author of several books on human behavior has said guidance is ef when it is thought out and fair written clearly explained thoroughly commonly understood and voluntarily complied with too many rules lead to cynicism and noncompliance and because not all situations can be anticipated rules cannot be developed to cover all possible developments in these cases the human ability to adapt to changing situations is just as important as the implementation of effective policies and procedures need to reach point where two types of professional discipline become second habits kern said first is the organizational discipline to keep the rules to an absolute minimum and enforce the rules across the board the second is the personal discipline to comply company policies too often he said policies and procedures conflict with cultural norms and when that happens who studies noncompliance knows that culture will nearly always trump policy at least in the long run not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent risk and based on the different objective environments from approach to approach there can be conflict between these and the singular prescriptive company go policy as in by the pilots disagreement with company go policy thresholds once pilot is outside the prescriptive box of go policy and has made the decision to continue the approach he is left to his individual risk assessment method whatever that may be to determine his personal risk thresh without guidance robust prescriptive policies that allow for some guided open analysis of risk and decision making can offer solution to these cases in which the objective env and stated policies do not align well for example if company go policy says that flight crew must go around in all cases if the aircraft has not touched down within seven seconds of crossing the threshold the pilots likely would view the importance of that policy dif depending on the conditions of the day they would likely be more in agreement with the policy for an approach to shorter runway that was contaminated and had slight tail wind than for an approach to longer dry runway with slight head wind if the policy is written to allow some devi from the seven requirement under some guiding principles pilots will agree with the policy more often in this example of the short contaminated runway the pre briefing should include statement that there would be no modification of the seven rule whereas in the case of the dry long runway the briefing may include an allowance to increase that time frame to seconds it is important to em that these allowances should follow guided process laid out by the company and that the policies remain pre do mi prescriptive in this example guiding principles may be that all crew members agree in advance of the modification and that the landing distance available exceeds the landing distance required by predetermined percentage allowing some guided decision making pilots will be more likely to trust and voluntarily comply with written policies in part because those policies will address the highly variable environments in which pilots work and also because the pilots will recognize that their expertise and real knowledge are being used in the risk process an increased agree on policy leads to increased buy and to the normalization of compliance stable approach criteria gates callout and decision points it is also worth discussing the relationship between the stable approach criteria the sah targets gates safe landing guidelines and decision points as the decision to go around remains possible up until the point of thrust deploy and go policies usually indicate that go should be initiated any time an aircraft becomes unstable below the sah then it follows that the decision point to go around defines the beginning of zone in which go is mandatory if the approach is unstable thrust reverser deployment defines the end of that zone most sop callout however channel flight crews to specific decision points to determine if they are in state in which it is safe to continue the approach these points are before thrust deploy these sop callout points are usually linked with sah leaving no formal stable callout for an extended period of time when go is viable active calls selection of calls that are mandatory for all varying objective conditions force communication between pilots passive or conditional calls on the other hand are only communicated if stimulated by condition the weakness in the passive call process is that if call is not made it could be for reasons other than the required objective condition being present for example if crew member did not see the condition call would not be made in addition crew member might choose not to make call for varying reasons such as subjective interpretation of the condition or fear of the cockpit authority structure active calls are always made and as stated they force com munic their absence indicates another problem such as pilot incapacitation many responsive callout by the pilot flying at sah or minimum approach height suggest what will happen what they are going to do for example suggestive calls like this to degree influence the decision to land and close the window for the decision to go around even though go may be required if the flight becomes unstable very late in the approach or landing repeated and escalated calls allow condition to remain alive in the conscious mind of the pilot on the other hand single callout for example at sah raises situational awareness about the condition at that moment as situational awareness is dynamic it can change quickly improving or worsening and callout that are designed to continue as long as the condition exists help to maintain awareness of that condition escalation of the calls can heighten awareness take the example of callout from enhanced ground proximity warning systems and other terrain awareness and warning systems the system alerts the flight crew to pending condition and continues with callout until the condition is no longer present the same effect can be ac com in unstable approach callout by both crew members and automated systems as the onset of approach instabilities can occur at any time even late in the landing phase keys to safe arrival the window for go decision follows that is the deci is not made at defined point at the sah the decision points for go are separate and distinct from the stable approach window and as such procedure designers can separate the two to maximize go decision making in reviewing the fsf alar task force elements of stabilized approach safety foundation alar task force we discover somewhat conflicting mes it states that approaches in instrument meteorological conditions must be stabilized before reaching ft agl visual meteorological conditions they must be stabilized before ft agl in precision non precision and visual approaches alike on the other hand the document indicates that descent below ft is acceptable in maneuver for circling approach and specifies that should be level on final when the aircraft reaches ft above airport elevation in other words on precision guided approach the documented guidance is that the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl in vmc and on circling non guided approach the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl it is not difficult for pilot to conclude that if it is acceptable and safe to fly off final approach profile until ft agl on non approach then it is also safe to fly an instrument approach to ft off profile although that is by definition unstable objective monitoring objective monitoring is that which does not require an individual to interpret information based on his or her ex or opinion it is usually factual information objective feedback in the cockpit minimizes the need for interpretation and can lead to more consistent and faster decision making additionally stating fact instead of interpreting inform making judgment or forming an opinion helps mini the effect of steep authority gradient in the cockpit such as may exist when low first officer is paired with high captain an example of objective feedback is that by an automated system such as egp ws in this case there is little subjective analysis done by the pilot when re to automated callout and the response can be quick and predictable this is in part why an automated energy management approach monitoring and alerting sy can be very effective in improving go compliance another example of the use of objective feedback is the use of radio altimeter automatic callout rather than interpreting radio altimeter readout information readouts can fluctuate due to terrain variances and must be observed and evaluated callout on the other hand are only heard in the absence of an automated energy management system after pilots cross the threshold they usually subjectively interpret or sense how much runway has passed by or how much remains from this they decide whether to conduct go if the pilot monitoring times the threshold crossing and then makes procedural call at the point where touchdown should occur or go should begin this call constitutes objective feedback to the pilot flying and makes clear that some either touchdown or go should occur should have occurred driven by policy and sops minimizing subjectivity in go decision pro is an objective that procedural designers should make every effort to achieve analysis management decision making overview of results in table we present data for managers self of their awareness of and if possible their specific estimates of both the industry and their own companies rates of compliance with unstable approach policy when asked whether they knew what the industry compliance rate was only percent of managers said that they did of those who claimed awareness however fewer were willing to estimate rate thirty managers percent of the participating offered an estimated rate which averaged percent compliance times the true rate and was highly variable percent to percent standard deviation percent only one in seven managers percent reported rate that was considered percent of the actual percent industry rate the perception of industry rates may not be the central concern of managers working to police their own noncompliance with unstable approach policy but this general lack of awareness and accuracy in estimating the true rate even among those claiming awareness cannot be overstated when asked whether they knew what their own company compliance rate was percent of managers said that they did although only percent offered an estimate of that rate thus majority of managers are largely unaware of unstable approach compliance and noncompliance rates even within their own companies of the managers who offered estimates the mean rate was percent compliance again with large range to percent and standard de percent these managers are estimating comp li rates at their companies that are on average more than percent above the industry average as they perceive it percent if their estimates were accurate they would indicate that the managers companies were outperforming the indus as whole by more than tenfold percent vs percent what is most striking is the tremendous degree of variability in the data revealing that there is very little common basis of perception even among those claiming knowledge of the rates at their own airlines in our view it is highly unlikely that this is an objective estimate for perceptions to have truly tracked with reality these data would mean that companies are ex the full range of compliance from zero to percent it is hard to imagine that this is the case and hard to imagine how this could result in an industry average that hovers at percent year after year table manager self of awareness and levels of ua policy compliance perceived rates of compliance with ua policy for the industry for their company flight operations as indicated by their company flight data analysis program awareness of rate claiming knowledge of each rate reporting rate of perceived rate of compliance not answer perceived rate of compliance those reporting go na not applicable sd standard deviation ua unstable approach source the presage group for flight safety foundation all companies percent had flight data anal program of the managers at those comp percent reported on their rate of compliance as indicated by their data these managers are not the same who reported on their companies flight operations compliance rates in answer to the prior question one in eight managers percent reported fda compliance rates broadly in line with the industry average less than percent at the opposite end of the spectrum percent re rates above percent the mean rate was percent again with wide range and variability to percent with standard deviation of percent that such spread of compliance rates is reported by this sample is surprising we believe it reflects not only general lack of awareness among managers of the rates of compliance with their own policies strongly indicated by the incidence of non but perhaps also specific errors within their knowledge although objective data are available this assertion can only be made however by again assuming that compliance rates exceeding percent are rare in the industry we cannot rule this out because although we have access to self data we lack objective verification of company compliance rates if the self rates are accurate it suggests that our sample is drawn from an unusually compliant subsample of companies in that light the lack of awareness effects across the manager study suggests that industry awareness could be less than estimated we begin with some overall observations about the data in table first on each of the three questions the norma response is to not know and only minority of man ag claim to know or report rate of compliance second as expected managers claim and report compliance rates for their own companies more frequently than they do for the industry as whole probably because they are less familiar with industry data third their perception of the industry compliance is out of line with reality six times greater than the actual percent rate of compliance fourth managers tell us as an aggregate sample that they believe their companies are outperforming the industry rate of compliance by to percent on average this is the equivalent of compliance rate at least times greater than the industry as whole finally if we assume that these com have more realistic unstable approach policy compliance rate below percent rate span still up to three times better than the current industry norm this would mean that only about one in seven managers to percent in the survey reported an accurate rate for their own companies whether their reporting was based on personal estimate or on their fda data if we give them more credit and allow that their companies actually achieved rates upward of percent then high accuracy of managers rates of report is still shared by fewer than one of the sample seven in simply do not know their own rates or if they do know they over their compliance rates by more than percent these kinds of perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence and complacency about mangers unstable approach policy compliance manager situational awareness profile manager perceptual measures of situational awareness managers completed questions to assess their attitudes beliefs and behaviors concerning their company go rates and unstable approach policies the results are in table first the responses were subjected to an empirical factor analysis to determine how they merged in managers minds and to provide simpler summary categories for presentation and discussion three of the four factors to emerge had more than one associated question one factor was single assessment of behavior namely whether the respondent debriefed flight crew who had violated the com unstable approach policy factor theme was the perceived support that the re spon received from their companies in understanding and managing go rates the six questions this factor com were averaged and called support factor comprised questions assessing the degree to which managers thought that their companies unstable approach policies and procedures and their associated operational definitions were effective clear and appropriate responses to five questions were averaged to create an index of effectiveness finally factor was an expression of man ag concerns about and sense of urgency surrounding their companies go rates it was formulated by averaging responses to the five questions shown in table and named threat in addition to the four factors we present overall measures recorded by managers of their satisfaction with and the per effectiveness of their companies go policies and procedures as they relate to unstable approaches the first thing to notice in table about these manager per is the absolute levels of the means on the underlying six scale six scale did not offer midpoint but instead presented the opportunity to report slight moder or strong agreement or disagreement with each statement or assertion the midscale is on this to like rt scale like rt scale is

managers perceive moderate degree of effectiveness of their policies and procedures and slightly less than moderate level of up from their organizations in managing their go rates the overall measure of perceived effectiveness was slightly weaker than the index score of effectiveness overall satisfaction with compliance rates associated with their flight operation go policies while slightly lower was still on the positive side of the scale in concert with this pattern perhaps because of these perceptions and judgments man slightly disagreed overall threat that there was cause for concern or need for action to improve their go rates taken together these absolute scores indicate that man ag are not completely happy with their companies per for on go policy and procedures but their concerns are not great enough seemingly to stimulate greater aware or action as an aside regression analysis of the drivers of the effectiveness and satisfaction scores revealed that overall effectiveness is perceived in proportion to scores on the perceived effectiveness index and to lesser degree the lack of urgency and concern is expressed by scores on the perceived threat index in complementary fashion over satisfaction was driven first by lower perceived threat scores and secondarily by higher perceptions reflected in the perceived effectiveness index these meaningful differential patterns were observed although the overall measures of satisfaction and effectiveness were high finally managers on average narrowly agreed that they all flight crews who have broken our company policies on operational procedures for go taken at its face per disagree that all flight crews are debriefed high absolute number of managers who admit to less than complete debriefing protocols however while this may seem like high percentage the fact that the statement was phrased as debrief as opposed to company debriefs may account for the response to examine the relationships between positive perceptions of organizational support compliance effectiveness satis fac and low concern with their go rates we studied responses from only those managers who had reported on their companies fda go compliance rates that is of all those claiming knowledge of this inform we divided them into managers whose reports were generally close to the industry average of percent accept anyone who reported rate of less than percent into group we labeled reporting what looked like reasonably accurate rate compared with the industry base rate all other managers reported compliance rates from to percent and were placed in comparison group labeled reporting compliance rate not likely to be accurate the results show that stating an rate of comp li is associated at significant statistical levels with higher scores on two of the five questions on the second factor of per effectiveness the effectiveness index as whole and the overall single measure of effectiveness effective it is also correlated with lower scores on the perceived threat index and four of its five component questions while this pattern may seem obvious in hindsight it makes the point that independent of the level of support perceived for man ag company go rates were no differences on the perceived support index the perception of the company policies as effective and the threat as low may flow from basic lack of realistic knowledge or appraisal of the go compliance rates if this causal effect is true that is posi perceptions lead to low perceived threat then what is clearly indicated by these data is the need for consciousness raising about the industry norm of massive noncompliance and dissemination of the managers own companies data identifying their internal rates of unstable approach around policy compliance and noncompliance segmentation analysis to determine whether the sample included types of man ag whose views of their company go compliance rate and performance were consistent with each other and also different from other identified groups we conducted traditional cluster analysis on this sample of managers non agglomerative cluster analysis based on euclidean distances due to the small sample size we generated just two groups to compare and based the mathematics of this segmentation on variety of responses given in the survey this of segmentation consisted of the perception questions and the two overall measures of effectiveness and satisfaction all the measures presented in table not surprisingly the resulting groups consisted of one whose members perceived high risk in their go compliance rates risk perceivers group and second group whose members had more moderate view risk perceivers group the percent of man ag who perceived high risk differed from the percent of low perceivers on almost all measures in the survey and powerfully so in both the statistical sense and the magnitude sense degree of statistical difference table shows that on of measures and on all three indexes the high risk perceiver group showed pattern of higher concern and perceived threat lower satisfaction with their companies go compliance lower perceived policy and compliance presage

safety foundation effectiveness and lower perceived support from the organ iz for managing go rates they also reported lower rates of debriefing their noncompliant flight crews when we profiled these two groups on other measures collected in the study we found interesting correlated ef for example high risk perceiver types tended to see their company compliance rates as slightly under perform relative to industry norms whereas low risk perceiver types reported that their companies were definitely outperforming the industry compliance rate high risk types were more likely to claim that prior to the study they had been aware of the industry rate and of their own company flight operations rate of compliance interestingly those in the high risk perceiver group were more likely to report being in roles in which they had less power to effect change more often saying they were able only to offer re com added to the fact that members of the high risk perceiver group were three times less likely than those in the low risk perceiver group to say their compliance rates were between and percent suspect number and more than four times as likely to say that their fda showed their rate was between zero and percent number more in line with industry norms picture emerges of group whose members are more realistic and appropriately anxious and concerned about their companies low rates of go compliance but who perhaps have little voice or power within the company to change policy or procedures they see as more likely to be unrealistic or to offer new definition of what should constitute stable approach they see as overly narrow how did these managers score on the presage indices of situational awareness this situation presents clear instance of violation via near noncompliance of most airlines policies and procedures surrounding unstable approach go performance rates and their manage as such our metrics are likely to show low absolute scores on scale of to with corresponding to high safety awareness the first column of table which displays these scores for the overall sample shows this to be the case in no case does the absolute score on any of our awareness metrics exceed the midscale of safety awareness is low in all of the awareness areas assessed by our system we know in this instance that unstable approach go noncompliance is major problem for the industry our measures of situational awareness are scored higher when this problem is recognized to be present in the ap to scoring shown in table all measures are scored such that higher numbers indicate greater degree of realistic threat awareness and appraisal as result higher situational awareness on our measures is associated with seeing the cur threat to be real anticipatory awareness and the procedural measures used to compensate for it to be in ad adjusting to the threat managers with higher situational awareness see their current procedures as un re and the definitions of instability as too narrow scores on knowing the procedures and knowing the limits their experience awareness high reliance on ex peri tells them there is problem and they feel more anxious and eager to take action against this safety threat gut feeling for threats however because new plan is needed in the face of general lack of appreciation of the threat to compliance in their organizations higher awareness is also associated with perception that their companies have little will to change and are generally complacent about the sops in place to manage the threat relational and corporate support for safety as result those with higher awareness also feel less support from and higher level of discomfort in approaching senior management to broach the issue with this understanding of our scoring methods in mind we examined the scores of the two groups the managers who reported compliance rate based on their fda that was than percent versus those who overest the compliance rate percent or more we hypoth sized that more accurate awareness of the true low rate of compliance would be associated with heightened sense of awareness perceived threat and anxiety the felt need to com etc all aspects of the situational awareness model we predicted therefore that managers who were aware of the actual low rate of compliance with unstable approach around policies at their airlines would receive higher scores on all nine of our metrics than their colleagues who were unaware even if the magnitude of these scores was still low in absolute terms when compared to the scale range in table it can be seen that on seven of our nine metrics of situational awareness the hypothesis that the go respondents would report greater situational awareness was supported at level of statistical reliability of percent or better that is if this experiment were repeated times we would observe the same differences in of the replications only on the procedures and each other safe were the levels of awareness similar for the two groups albeit at low absolute levels in summary those aware of the low compliance rates at their companies scored at or above the midscale on five of our metrics critical af fec anticipatory and compensatory if minimum midscale threshold of situational awareness across majority of our measures was enough to trigger some action the individuals in this group were close to reaching such trigger point how note that this group constituted just percent of of our sample small minority coming to full aware of the problem table also shows results derived from cluster analysis on the presage metrics for the two groups those perceiving relatively high risk in their companies unstable approach around policies and rates percent of sample and those not generally perceiving such risks percent will be recalled these groups were designed for all managers in the sample irrespective of whether they claimed to know or ventured to report what their company compliance rate actually was according to fda or otherwise in this case all nine awareness factors are statistically reliably different with five means above the midscale for the high perception group these results are more encouraging in terms of the complement of managers perhaps ready to act in this important area of noncompliance as about one of the sample shows signs of having reached threshold of aware that will trigger activity to manage this issue more safely in the near future as demonstration of the effect that improved awareness in one area can have on overall situational awareness we compared the situational awareness scores of all managers with the scores of the group whose members were aware of their internal company go compliance rates figure shows the incremental benefit that awareness in one area can have across eight of the nine constructs finally it is relevant to discuss the industry approach to monitoring unstable approach flight data as many flight data monitoring programs are set to report only when more than one stable approach criterion is exceeded and in some programs to report only low level alert until three or more criteria are exceeded we see an indication from those responsible for the design of these programs that there is an acknowledged variability in the risk of unstable approaches and more importantly there is an indication of disc on between the level of management concern for low risk unstable approaches and the policy guidance for flight crews on those same approaches which is to execute go when one or more criteria are exceeded from the per spec of the flight crews why should they be concerned about the risk of this level of unstable approaches if management is not concerned enough to want to be told about them or act on situational awareness of managers who knew company compliance rules feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits cop orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures additional bene base score source the presage group for flight safety foundation them this is consistent with the results of both the pilot and management psychological studies industry sensing the conversation about reducing the risk of alas often drifts toward how to eliminate unstable approaches even though the discussion begins with focus on rates of compliance with go policies it is clear that there is larger disco with the existence of unstable approaches despite the fact that the industry has reduced unstable approaches to percent or less in an industry with such variable objective environments one must ask is the lowest attainable unstable approach rate it makes sense that an industry with almost nonexistent compliance with go policies would be concerned about the small number of unstable approaches that occur if we turn the tables and consider for moment an industry with high rate of go policy compliance would there be as much concern about unstable approaches and is the focus on eliminating unstable approaches the right strategy in reducing alas in flight safety foundation year study of runway excursions conducted in we see that percent of the landing excursions were las as veer and of these percent followed stable approach that became unstable during the landing phase only percent of the landing excursions followed unstable approaches overruns accounted for the other percent of landing excursions percent of overruns followed stable approaches and percent followed unstable approaches in total percent of landing runway excursions followed stable approaches and an almost number per followed unstable approaches separate analysis by boeing of runway overrun excursions from to found that percent followed stable approaches and aaron drawing from this concentrated effort to reduce figure overall manager situational awareness scores feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits cop orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures source the presage group for flight safety foundation number of unstable approaches that become unstable in the approach phase will address less than half of all landing excursions on the other hand reliable go decision making operation has the potential to affect most landing ex those occurring after flights that become unstable during the approach or landing phase clearly strategy to continue improving the stable approach rate in addition to improving the go compliance rate is the most com strategy the point of this discussion is to illustrate that the industry tendency to focus only on eliminating unstable approaches will not address large portion of alas and that improving the go compliance rate holds the greater risk potential in an fsf runway safety initiative determined that gap existed in alar tool kit risk reduction tools which did not address the landing phase itself the foundation then developed safe landing guidelines keys to safe arrival which are intended to be used by aircraft operators to enhance existing sops throughout this project and through industry confer and meetings it was apparent that these guidelines were not well known or commonly documented in company manuals these findings were not part of the data collection surveys findings go decision making the following are decision findings drawn from analysis mp denotes decision pilot findings

was prompting the crew to initiate go mp finding unstable approach pilots are less likely than go pilots to feel support for safety from their companies and said they were less likely to be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to landing and more likely to believe that the incentive structure of their company does not discourage unstable approaches to landing mp finding unstable approach pilots believe that their com criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic mp finding unstable approach pilots in hindsight feel regret about continuing an unstable approach more strongly than go pilots regret going around and feel less positive about the outcomes of their decisions mp finding unstable approach pilots have lower sense of situational awareness across most facets which leads them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their risk assessments finding pilot norms and processes for continuing unstable approaches provide little foundation for

assessment and decision making finding pilots who believe that their company criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe on whole that the threshold for the aircraft to be on profile and in proper configuration is below ft closer to to ft agl mp finding pilots who believe that their company criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe on whole that they can compensate for energy management until the aircraft descends to ft agl and under certain conditions below ft mm finding at the managerial level there are indications of general disengagement with the topic of go policy and procedures mm finding among managers there is general lack of awareness of industry rates of go policy compliance finding among managers there is general lack of awareness of their own company rates of go policy compliance finding among managers who have objective go noncompliance rate data such as flight data understanding of the compliance rate is likely inaccurate mm

or authority within the company to change policy or procedures mm finding managers who scored higher on the situational awareness measure associated with seeing the current threat as real awareness also scored lower in relative terms on the measure used to compensate correctly for the risk awareness suggesting the presence of helplessness with respect to effectively managing this risk mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores see their current procedures as being unrealistic and definitions of instabilities as being too narrow mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores had the perception that their companies have little will to change and are generally complacent about sops for managing go compliance mm finding managers with higher awareness of their companies go compliance rates also feel less support from senior managers and higher level of discomfort with ap them about the issue mm finding managers who were aware of low go compliance rates in their companies scored at or above the midscale on functional critical affective anticipatory and compensatory situational awareness metrics this is minority consisting of percent of respondents mm finding the industry tendency is to lean toward the single focus of improving the unstable approach rate as the best way to prevent alas even though empirical data indicate otherwise finding safe landing guidelines published by flight safety foundation to address an identified gap in the alar tool kit risk reduction tools is not well known by operators and not documented in operations manuals strategies for corrective action go decision making we conclude that there are three high categories that can be defined in achieving an effective policy from psycho logi perspective the policy should make sense operationally for most environmental conditions encountered for the people executing the policy crews and those managing the policy operations management and should be acceptable to those externally effected by the application of the policy traffic controllers the policy must be managed effectively by the organ iz tion management personnel this is important not only because of the organization need to achieve objectives set out by senior management but also because those exec ut the policy crews need to see and understand that the policy is being managed management over of the policy is apparent awareness of the policy guidance and the risks associated with not executing the policy must be high for both flight crews and management the following is list of recommended higher decision making strategies to mitigate go noncompliance dm strategy ensure the policy makes sense operationally update the stable approach definition and sah to maximize their relevance to flight crews and their manageability separate the stable approach definition and criteria from decision criteria and decision points to improve awareness that these are two distinct aspects of go policies and that decision making continues beyond the approach phase this does not imply that they cannot meet at points throughout the approach and landing it is intended for the sop and communication designers to separate the psychological attachment of these two aspects dm strategy manage the policy effectively operators set specific compliance rate targets per for indicators and establish initiatives to achieve them authorities amend industry and regulatory audit pro to include standards and recommended practices that address go noncompliance dm strategy increase awareness increase awareness of go noncompliance and risks associated with continuing to land when unstable and awareness of the significant impact that noncom pli has on alas among operator management ii flight crews iii industry and pilot associations regulators and manufacturers enhance situational awareness awareness to heighten flight crews awareness throughout the ap and beyond and landing through policy and procedural enhancements and ii communication improvements minimize the subjectivity of go decision making for the decision maker pf or captain as per com policy to mitigate those components of situational awareness that compromise the pilot risk assessment and decision ability for example by installing stable approach monitoring systems recommendations go decision making the following are decision recommendations for corrective action to mitigate go noncompliance and go execution risks each recommendation supports previously identified higher strategy dm recommendation manufacturers should continue develop of and operators should install stable approach and energy management monitoring and alerting systems dm recommendation operators should understand their own respective go compliance rates dm recommendation operators should establish internal go around compliance rate measures targets and goals dm recommendation where necessary flight crew assoc ia and operator management should establish basis and or process in which fda can be used to assist in effectively managing go compliance targets dm recommendation operators and the industry should re the stable approach criteria and sah to better align policies with manageable and operational safe practices see appendix for flight safety foundation analysis new stabilized approach and go guidelines for industry validation avoid stable approach criteria and heights that address very low approaches that is avoid criteria that if exceeded are not likely to result in go decision or that if go decision is made may transfer risk to higher go maneuver distinguish between profile criteria and lateral energy management criteria and go decision point criteria which could have distinct and separate heights allow for variable objective environments not all environ ment create the same risk profile high crosswind tail winds and contaminated runways statistically create the highest environments the stable approach criteria although mostly prescriptive should allow an element of guided risk decision making that is corroborated between crew members dm recommendation operators should establish and publish safe landing guidelines in operations manuals keys to safe arrival and bla je see appendix analysis revised safe landing guidelines for industry validation dm recommendation operators should develop com munic procedures to be performed during every approach that describes the state of stability and the intention of the decision maker based on company policy effective elements of these communications include the state of stability is made by the crew member not responsible for the decision to go around the pm or the first officer per company policy this creates shared responsibility for activity in the decision process communication procedures are active not passive or conditional call is made at the assigned point during every approach this forces communication communication procedures should be objective they should state facts about the condition this minimizes authority gradients within the cockpit communication procedures should be sequential and esca late if the condition is not corrected to within limits ac calls continue and escalate to defined point at which new directive call is mandated for example if an call at ft agl does not result in successful corrective action the calls continue every ft until the condition is corrected or critical point is reached and then directive call is made this maintains continuous situational awareness updating of the condition similar to ground warning system calls active communication should continue well into the ap proach and landing up to the touchdown limit point this maintains continuous situational awareness each condition call should be answered with an ac or notice call by the decision maker pf or captain per company policy the call should not suggest the exclusion of other possible outcomes calling at mini when go is an option can have the effect of minimizing the window of calling for go on the other hand responding with or assists in keeping decision making open dm recommendation operators should apply objective feedback procedures well into the approach and landing phase including in the touchdown zone energy management monitoring and alerting systems will minimize the need for crew calls dm recommendation operators should create standard pre descent briefing guidelines that include environmental risk factors instability factors that will result in go review of standard calls and decision making in the landing phase recommendation operators should create standard pre approach briefing guidelines that update the pre brief at low period just before the approach is begun dm recommendation operators should understand their re spec managers and flight crews situational awareness levels and psychological profiles for managing internal go policies dm recommendation operators should provide training to enhance psychosocial awareness and management and how they contribute to noncompliant decision making dm recommendation operators should ensure no fault go around policies are documented implemented and understood by management and flight crew dm recommendation operators should ensure that un approach and go policies are concise and un am big uous including follow procedures and expectations for noncompliance recommendation operators should communicate indus rates and internal go compliance rates measures targets and goals of performance to flight crews and the man ag involved in achieving them operators also should co mmu the risk potential that improved performance could have on the company overall risk profile dm recommendation state and industry audit programs such as the iata operational safety audit should establish go compliance standards and recommended practices for operators to manage go compliance dm recommendation state and industry safety organizations such as those associated with the international civil aviation organization the european aviation safety agency faa iata the faa commercial aviation safety team etc should review these recommendations and assess inserting them into their safety publications dm recommendation the aviation community should annually track through global aggregate flight data go compliance rates for both the approach phase and the landing phase of flight and communicate the findings to the industry this role is suited to safety organizations such as flight safety foundation dm recommendation the aviation community should develop and implement an initiative that communicates the industry go compliance rate and the risk potential that improved performance could have on the industry ala rate and the overall accident rate this is role suited to regulators global associations and safety organ such as flight safety foundation dm recommendation the aviation community should estab new information program to provide method for operators to share effective strategies to improve go around compliance rates alternatively the information should be incorporated into an existing program dm recommendation the industry should establish an ident fi for the threat effect of the phenomenon of noncompliance with go polices as labels such as con flight into terrain or loss of control make it easier for the industry to relate discuss understand and manage phenomenon label for this phenomenon will do the same and in so doing will help provide foundation for essential awareness effective utility of each recommendation is different and each recommendation addresses different finding or strategy as can be seen in appendix holistic approach to implementing these recommendations will have the best overall effect and as with any significant program change desired and undesired effects should be closely monitored by an appropriate audit program such as fda line operations safety audits or ios go execution methodology the go accident and incident review included non random selection of published reports on go in vol transport aircraft between and total of go events were included in some the safety of the go was central to the investigation and in others the go occurred in the aftermath of the event at the heart of the investigation the majority of the events percent involved single jets others involved twin turboprops percent and twin jets percent the nature of the sample independently investigated events in which an approach was followed at some point by go around meant that the sample group contained both safe and unsafe go sometimes the investigations focused on the circumstances that led to the go sometimes they focused on the go itself and sometimes they focused on both remarks contrasting the safe go with the risk bearing go are therefore subject to the qualification that the safe ones were just non subset of many more similar go that are routinely conducted because of both crew decisions and atc instructions the context safety aspects and overall level of risk of each event were shown on spreadsheet with as many of elec of as were applicable attached to each one not all tags were mutually exclusive and not all reports allowed the applicability of all of the tags to be established the extent to which many characteristics could be identified is therefore understated on the basis of the degree of risk posed by go each event was assigned to one of three categories high risk events moderate risk events and non events the non events involved circumstances some of which were similar to those of risk events that were the main concern of the investigation for the two risk categories six go around safety issues were defined in respect to the initiation and execution of each go most of the risk bearing events involved single gas but five events were assigned two gas is each each risk event was assigned one of three risks loc fit or midair collision the gas definitions and their associated outcome risks were ao initiation of go ineffective ao safe trajectory of aircraft not maintained once go around successfully initiated ao go not flown on required track at safe traffic separation not maintained during go around at wake turbulence hazard during go and en significant low wind shear during go in the percent of risk go in which the risk was attributable to the mismanagement and mishandling of the go by pilots failure to initiate go effectively was twice as prevalent as the failure to aviate and navigate properly once the go was initially established in the percent of risk go in which the risk was attributable to air traffic controllers the follow conditions applied one go followed controller failure to apply clearly established procedures in respect to late go which led directly to an unrecognized mac risk resolved by traffic and collision avoidance system resolution advisory five go involved controller misjudgments in dealing with the proximity of takeoffs to unexpected go around significant loss of separation in four cases and an unrecognized wake turbulence hazard in the other two events involved controllers talking to different aircraft on the same frequency in different languages in both cases pilots seeking to understand the developing situ both before and after the go began were deprived of valuable situational awareness two go involved single conflict between pilot declared go and controller go in which trainee controller under supervision in non radar environment was faced with an aircraft transition to conventional go and the resulting need to instruct the potentially conflicting aircraft which was on required navigation performance approach to fly an rn go the situational awareness of each flight crew both on go in imc of the potential proximity of the other aircraft was compromised by lack of procedure awareness decisions by pilots that were followed by poor initiation of go and that led to hull loss accidents in an airplane is destroyed or damaged and not repaired including events in which an airplane is missing or in acce due to either loc or fit were particularly likely to in crew in which either the pilot or the first officer was lacking in experience for the pic this lack of experience involved experience in either the aircraft type or the role of pic for the first officer it involved experience in the aircraft type or in multi operations generally all events in which the experience of both pilots was fully documented one or both pilots were low on experience ac to the above definitions in percent of fatal loss go accidents percent of all high go percent of all moderate go and percent of all non go excessive confidence by the pm pic that the pf first officer would achieve timely stabilization of the approach led the pic to delay takeover as pf often by the time the pic took the controls the circumstances had become more complex and the chances of not properly initiating the go had increased conversely excessive confidence by the pm first officer that the pf pic would achieve timely stabilization led in operating cultures that may not have addressed the effect of significant relative experience gap between the first officer and the pic to delayed or absent go call and in some cases to near takeover or an on takeover of control in order to make such call the more go are more likely than safer go around to have been preceded by one or more of the following significant procedural noncompliance which was recorded in percent of high events but in only percent of moderate events the same percentage as reported in non events delay in making the decision to go around which was re corded in percent of high events but only percent of medium events an even lower proportion than for non events and complex situation at the time of the go decision which was recorded in percent of high events but only percent of medium events about the same as for non events significant violation of landing minimums followed by go around decision was particular precursor of the nine fatal defined in this analysis as one or both of hours on type or hours in command defined in this analysis as one or both of hours multi experience or hours on type accidents during subsequently attempted go four percent of risk go decisions were made above ft half of these decisions were made because of an unstable approach condition compared with moderate go high go around are more likely to involve pilots with low levels of experience involve go decision made below decision altitude descent altitude be flown by the pic as pf be at risk of loc follow violation of da and involve surprise that they have become necessary high go are less likely to follow an unstabilized approach and involve change of pf at initiation of or during the go compared with moderate go non go are more likely to follow go decisions that were foreseen as poss bili rather than those that occurred unexpectedly and be made on atc instructions they are less likely to take place at night involve pilots with low levels of experience have the first officer as pf and involve surprise that they have become necessary they are just as likely to be preceded by significant procedural noncompliance and involve change of pf at the initiation of or during the go analysis go execution the go flight operations data analysis was performed with the objective of examining the prevalence of go safety risk during normal routine operations more than go events flown by jet aircraft operated by range of airlines from around the world were examined the analysis focused on the point at which the go began and the way it was conducted go events were found in data detailing almost flights the majority of these flights percent involved single jets twin jets made up the remain percent data showed that percent of the flight crews disc on the autopilot above ft percent disconnected the auto throttle above flare altitudes and percent disc on the flight director during the approach data showed the overall rate of go was percent or in approaches however it was possible to distinguish two subgroups lower go rate of percent for operators that appeared more likely to sub se divert following go and higher rate of percent for operators that appeared less likely to do so the go rate for long operations was percent higher than the overall rate for single jets the autopilot was engaged prior to go initiation in percent of the events and remained engaged in percent of these cases for twin jets the autopilot was engaged prior to the go initiation in percent of the events and remained engaged in percent of these cases forty percent of all go were initiated below ft percent were initiated below the category instrument landing system ils minimum height of ft and percent were initiated below ft exceed ance of the maximum permitted airspeed with flaps extended fe was recorded in percent of single jet go and percent of the twin jet go these fe exceed ance correlated with failure to reach and maintain the appropriate pitch target extended duration of go power settings an elapsed time of more than seconds without re trac of one stage of flaps applied in percent of cases and unstable approach an overall association was identified between the height on the approach at which go was initiated and the pitch attitude at which it was then flown the earlier the initiation of the go the lower the pitch attitude the data showed widespread prevalence of delayed flap retraction once go had been initiated whereas in only percent of go did it take more than seconds to retract the landing gear findings go execution go safety forum initiated by flight safety foundation the european regions airline association and euro control took place june at euro control headquarters in brussels it was held in support of the flight safety foundation go safety initiative to assist in early implementation of the actions detailed in the european action plan for the prevention of runway excursions issued in january the conference was attended by over par including members of the french bureau et who were conducting study of airplane state awareness during go the execution findings findings from the go safety forum included the following safety found era euro control ex finding go occur at an average rate of one to three per approaches there is large variation of go around rates among different aircraft operators and operational environments ex finding the go is normal phase of flight and pilots should be encouraged to conduct one when conditions warrant as well as when they are instructed to do so however since go is the least flown normal flight phase there are particular safety issues associated with it ex finding one in go reports record potentially hazardous outcome including exceeded aircraft performance limits or fuel endurance ex finding go is relatively rare maneuver for most commercial pilots on average short pilot may conduct go once or twice year and long pilot may conduct one every two to three years ex finding conducting go carries number of risks including ineffective initiation of go which can lead to loc failure to maintain control during go which can lead to loc including abnormal contact with the runway or to fit failure to fly the required track which can lead to fit or mac failure to maintain traffic separation which can lead to mac and generation of wake turbulence which may create hazard for another aircraft that can lead to loc ex finding the height at which go is initiated during an approach can present different challenges and risks above the approach procedure minimum altitude at the approach procedure minimum altitude and below the approach minimum altitude finding low relevant experience of one or both pilots is associated with difficulty in flying go ex finding go that follow violation of approach minimums are associated with reduced safety margin ex finding it is necessary for operators to be aware of the extent to which go are being flown and the validated reasons for them as well as the extent to which the go are flown safely ex finding just culture must prevail if problems in go around safety are to be sufficiently understood and addressed ex finding aircraft energy states that are too high or too low make the safe execution of go less likely and this situation can be exacerbated by failure to understand how to manage aircraft pitch attitude ex finding the safety of go is compromised by de in deciding to begin go when the aircraft becomes unstabilized below mandatory stabilized approach gate approach gates ex finding the decisions that precede unsafe go are often made at points other than pre procedural decision points finding pilot go training needs to be pro por to the rate at which go are experienced in line operations ex finding the effectiveness of flight deck monitoring can have significant effect on the safe execution of go but such monitoring often is poor ex finding lack of an adequate understanding of automation by pilots can affect go safety ex finding pilot understanding of how the pitch control system works is not always apparent in their actions during go ex finding the potential for traffic and wake vortex conflict during go is sometimes reduced if pilots are unaware of other traffic in the vicinity ex finding most pilots fly the potentially complex transition to go from circle approach so infrequently that maintaining competency will require an unrealistic amount of recurrent training in proportion to other requirements ex finding the extent of controller training in respect to go around risk management is variable ex finding controllers sometimes issue instructions that may prevent pilots from conducting stabilized approach and may thereby increase the number of go ex finding go procedures can be complex at time of high workload for pilots the procedures are not always published tactical de of go can place high demands on controllers complexity is increased when there are multiple approach procedures for the same runway each with its own missed approach point ex finding too much information in one controller radio transmission an explanation of the reason when giving an executive instruction can lead to pilot confusion late provision of or changes to go instructions late changes to published map unless these clearly simplify it increase workload for pilots ex finding some pilots are reluctant to decline acceptance of atc instructions that are not compatible with aircraft per especially when issued at times when pilot work is already high issuing unpublished go approach tactical instructions at or after the initiation of go can place high demands on pilots there is no direct link between aircraft operator and atc go training awareness ex finding current pilot go procedures may not adequately address all the circumstances in which an ad hoc go around decision may be made especially above ft agl or after decision to continue an approach made at da ex finding go operational challenges are not ad reflected in current regulatory requirements strategies for corrective action go execution the safety forum discussed in depth the issues related to go around decision making execution and training and the air traffic management aspects of safe go forum par agreed on series of conclusions in respect to eight safety improvement strategies three of these strategies were execution strategies strategies related to the safe execution of go ex strategy ensure that go training and awareness ap reflect different go execution risk scenarios note independent cast analysis determined similar find and recommendations which are outlined in cast safety enhancement ex strategy review go policy procedures and ocu men to maximize their effectiveness clarity and understanding ex strategy ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew members does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitor during approach landing and go recommendations go execution the following principal recommendations for safe go execution recommendations are based on safety forum conclusions ex recommendation aircraft operators and atc should im their mutual understanding of each other go practices ex recommendation industry partners should develop go around training aids ex recommendation effective monitoring depends on ensuring that pilots with low relevant experience are able to contribute to safe go decision making and execution ex recommendation pilots and their employers should under that one of the many reasons that violating approach minimums is unacceptable is because evidence indicates that if go then becomes necessary the chances of safe transition to the go are reduced ex recommendation pilots must be able to demonstrate that they are able to safely execute go that begin from both high energy and low energy states at the point where go around decision is indicated ex recommendation pilots must be able to exercise tactical judgment as well as procedural compliance when deciding to go around below stabilized approach gate so that safe execution is not hindered by an inappropriate delay in decision making validation of this must be achieved through realistic training scenarios ex recommendation go training for pilots should include range of operational scenarios including go from positions other than da and the designated sta approach gate scenarios should involve realistic simulation of surprise typical landing weights and full go ex recommendation go training for both pilots and controllers should incorporate lessons learned from operational events ex recommendation clear guidance should be provided to pilots on how to act in respect to the three stages of monitoring during approach landing and go noticing alerting and taking control members of augmented crews who are observing should have clear understanding of the nature of their contr to effective monitoring ex recommendation if an aircraft has the capability to fly automatic go pilot training should be provided and the operator automation policy should address the go procedure ex recommendation pilots must have clear understanding of how the pitch control system works on the aircraft type that they fly this should be validated by both theoretical testing and use of suitable full flight simulator exercises involving approach and go with full rather than reduced power available and at typical landing weights ex recommendation review should be conducted to deter whether pilots can lose situational awareness of pot en conflicting traffic during go if other pilots are exchanging radio transmissions with atc in languages other than english ex recommendation high priority should be accorded to the provision of rn approach and missed approach pro ce dures when current procedures involve circle and when active radar surveillance of the transition to go is not available consideration should be given to withdrawing circle procedures at airports where neither option is available ex recommendation air navigation service providers should review and if necessary enhance the provision of go around risk awareness training for controllers ex recommendation ensure that the importance of fac lit at stabilized approach and the correct application of final approach procedures is included in training and in briefings for atc staff recommendation implementation advice training should include appropriate speed control instructions timely descent instructions the importance of avoiding late change of runway or change in the type of approach the importance of assigning landing runway with no significant tail wind component the need to avoid vectoring too tightly onto final ap and intercepting glide path from above and the importance of providing the crew with correct information about distance to touchdown ex recommendation the agency responsible for instrument approach procedure design should ensure that straightforward go procedures are available and published for each runway these go procedures should be designed in consultation with pilots who are representative of those who will be expected to use them advice the principles which underlie the map for each run should as much as possible be the same low below ft first stop altitude and an early turn in missed approach procedure should be avoided conditional go procedures approach procedures xxx but not later than yy should be avoided the common missed approach fix should be located close to the airport to ensure that an aircraft in trouble can be landed immediately on any runway with any track chosen by the pilot procedural de of the missed approach path from other traffic and from the risk of exposure to wake turbulence especially from late go should be provided if both rn and conventional missed approach pro ce are published then an explicit risk assessment of such availability should be performed environmental restrictions especially noise abatement restrictions must not affect the design of missed approach procedures if their imposition would compromise safety standards ex recommendation on final approach pilots should be advised of any significant changes in weather and runway surface conditions contingency arrangements should exist for use in wind shear conditions implementation advice pilots should receive more relevant and quicker up of weather information about develop such as changes in visibility wind and runway status quantity of water on the runway improved information should be provided to crews about tail winds wind shear and significant wind variation including reports from preceding aircraft runway information should include items such as braking action reports information about the pre of standing water debris and wildlife including birds reports of technical problems on the ground and reports of laser interference ex recommendation guidance should be developed for controllers regarding the content and timing of go instructions advice controllers should consider whether go instruction should be delivered in separate trans mis from one that explains the instruction controllers must always use the standard map if there is no imperative reason for an adaptation if non missed approach procedure is to be followed controllers should detail it when issuing the approach clearance controllers should avoid last changes or in except in emergency situations once pilot has declared go or is otherwise known to have begun one controllers should avoid unnecessary transmissions pilot should inform atc as soon as possible if devi from the published go procedure become necessary ex recommendation an sps should consider the feasibility of establishing formal interface between pilots and controllers to explore operational issues and reach an understanding implementation advice pilots can be invited to attend controllers training sessions and controllers may be able to arrange to observe pilots training sessions days can be provided for pilots to observe operations at atc facilities and it may be possible to organize familiarization flights for controllers pilots and controllers should participate in joint crew resource management training in establishing such interfaces be aware that it is most unlikely that the pilots participating in such an initiative will be representative of those using the atc services involved and any such bias must be explicitly recognized ex recommendation aircraft manufacturers should ensure that go procedures presented in aircraft pilot training and aircraft operating manuals are applicable to go that are begun at any stage on final approach up to and including land that are rejected after touchdown ex recommendation safety regulators should review current mandatory go training requirements for both pilots and controllers and should ensure that the conclusions of this report are appropriately addressed flight safety foundation future work establish go noncompliance industry label such as gan noncompliance or fga to go around this is to establish easy recognition as has been accomplished with other labels such as loc or fit analyze and report at global aggregate level unstable approaches and unstable landings to determine the level of associated risk report global go compliance performance annually develop go execution and training guidelines for operators establish industry go noncompliance audit standards and recommended practices with organizations such as the international civil aviation organization and iata in order to minimize the exposure to unnecessary go while ensuring safety further analysis is required to deter the risk balance point between an unstable approach and go the foundation should ensure industry partners pursue this analysis promote the distribution and presentation of this report in industry and encourage republication in complementing publications and safety initiatives project conclusion the problem of go policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the largest threat to flight safety today the potential impact of improvement in compliance is igni fi no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go around the first and foremost change required is that the industry must improve its awareness of the problem to achieve this shift in focus and cultural norms is required it is believed that significant improvement is attainable however the cultural shift will be much easier if the industry shifts collectively as opposed to individual companies making changes on their own having said this several companies are already attacking this issue internally the project accomplished the goals set forth in the document announcing the fsf go safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight crew members and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight managers and to consider the safety risk associated with go and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines

fully stabilized when all of the following criteria are met pro only small changes in heading are required to maintain the correct flight path profile specific types of approaches are stabilized if they fulfill the following cat ils within deviation of glide path and localizer rna within deflection of vertical and lateral scales and within rn requirements loc within lateral deviation and visual

airspeed is stabilized within ref kt to ref wind adjustments thrust is stabilized to maintain the target approach airspeed sink rate is no greater than fpm general the stabilized approach gates should be observed and active communication calls made during each approach normal bracketing corrections in maintaining stabilized conditions occasionally involve momentary overshoots made necessary by atmospheric conditions such overshoots are acceptable frequent or sustained overshoots are not unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions requiring deviation from the above elements require

notes continuing past the related gate should only occur if meeting the objective of the next gate is achievable otherwise go around example if the is not con by ft it could continue if being fully stable by ft is achievable if the call at the respective gate indicates an undesired state con or that call should be repeated at an appropriate interval until the condition is corrected example repeated every ft stabilized approach and go decision guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind flight safety found guidelines for conducting stabilized approaches and achieving reliable go decision making why the change the current fsf guidelines were established in november and updated in analysis revealed that facets of that guidance are not optimal for effective deci making and that they may encourage go for approaches involving very low risk the overall goal is to improve go decision making in revising the stabilized approach guidelines four objectives must be met the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and management resulting in greater acceptance of the policy safety must be ensured during the approach by mitigating against the common types of alas energy short hard landing tail strike and runway excursions veer it must be ensured that the resulting go are con ducted for approaches of appropriate risk and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to go ma increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on atc the flight crew collective situational awareness must be improved through better communication flight crews indicated in the foundation project research that current guidelines on when go must be executed are not realistic for most real operational environments and approaches they described what realistic parameters look like from their perspective the criteria for which stable approach is defined can be grouped into three types of parameters flight path profile and lateral configuration gear and speed brakes and energy management of descent speed and thrust add to these the variable environmental conditions length and condition and weather and there are four groups of parameters to be considered when designing stable approach criteria approach gates we can address all stable approach parameters and ala safety issues at three procedural gates agl configuration gate from ft to ft depending on aircraft type agl stable gate and agl go gate the stable approach criteria are the same at each gate for ap conducted in both imc and vmc ft agl configuration gate previous guidance required that go must be con if the flight was not fully stable in imc with respect to the physics of go safety is the same in both imc and vmc in this context differentiation of go at feet in imc and at feet in vmc is not required the new functional significance of the mark is that it is the last suitable point along the approach to ensure that final landing configuration is selected and verified by the flight crew the flap and gear transition deceleration to final approach speed and thrust stabilization should occur before the aircraft reaches the next gate at ft agl it should be emphasized that initial configuration should occur before reaching the gate this gate is the last point at which final landing configuration should be selected and confirmed the gate is familiar demarcation to flight crews and is often accompanied by an automatically generated callout note that the gate may vary for air type and gross weight the operator should determine the appropriate height of the gate based on aircraft de cele ra characteristics and the manufacturer recommend the following discussion of aircraft energy management during approach is based on the fsf alar briefing notes safety foundation aircraft deceleration characteristics although deceleration characteristics largely depend on the aircraft type and gross weight the following typical values can be considered for quick assessment and management of aircraft deceleration capability deceleration on three glide path with landing flaps and gear down to kt per nm note three glide path is typically equivalent to descent gradient of or vertical speed for final approach groundspeed of kt example aircraft with final approach speed of kt would need to be at maximum speed of kt at the gate to be stable at ft using the median deceleration rate of kt per nm and descent rate of fpm kt nm kt gate does not address any particular ala type but serves to facilitate achieving fully stabilized approach at the next lower gate ft additionally it is in line with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project that aircraft configuration and aircraft energy management are two separate and distinct aspects of stabilized approach and the aircraft energy stabilization height can be lower than the aircraft configuration height although go may be considered at this gate not mandating go at this point reduces the overall number of potential go by allowing low unstable approaches to continue at safe altitude analysis is discussed in improved collective situational awareness at this gate is achieved through procedural active communication between flight crew agl gate previous guidance required that go must be conduct if the flight was not fully stable in vmc the revised guid retains the recommendation that the approach should be fully stable at this gate however the mandate to go around has been removed although go may be considered at this gate not mandating go reduces the overall number of potential go by allowing low unstable approaches to con while at safe altitude analysis is found in not mandating go at this gate also aligns with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project findings indicating go can still be executed safely even from lower altitudes when conditions are stable or have only minor deviations outside the stable approach definition as this makes operational sense to those who execute and manage the policy there is better likelihood of compliance the gate is suitable point in the approach for flight crew to verify all stable approach criteria it is familiar de mar for flight crews and is also often accompanied by an au generated callout being stable at this point in the approach allows for subsequent developing instabilities to be compared against state of constant energy reduction improved collective situational awareness at this gate is also achieved through procedural active communication between flight crew ft agl go gate this gate is new establishing this gate clearly marks the boundary between higher altitudes where stable approach is strongly recommended and the point where continuing an unstable descent reduces the margin of safety it differentiates between approach stability and go decision these are two distinct flight issues and from sy perspective they should remain distinct elements in decision making it should be understood that the agl value is not intended to be absolute it can be approximated to take ad of aircraft automatic callout systems for example consider an ils minimum set for ft agl some manuf ac automatic callout systems provide an alert ft above minimums so in such cases ft agl could be established as the go gate value and utilized in the auto callout in the active call procedures descending in an unstable state below the gate should be warning to flight crews that the level of risk is increasing and action is required whether the aircraft is unstable at this gate or becomes unstable below ft analyses indicate that flight crews who continue an unstable descent below ft do not recognize the need for increased concern or the need for go the awareness of the increased need for action can be improved by heightening the definition of the aircraft condition from being in an unstable condition to being in condition to go around this can prompt the flight crew to make the correct decision to go around martin smith of the pre group explains psychological tipping point is the moment of maximum situational awareness is when the flight crew is primed to pull the trigger on the go the subtle change to to go around is such primer in other words the to go around is permission to act per mis to comply drawing comparison to another industry initiative the pilot not flying is now known as the pm change that was intended to influence the mindset of the pm and also to alter his behavior in recognition of the importance of monitoring similar effect can be realized in identifying an unstable flight condition below ft as go condition condition that demands go decision to further emphasize the point the to win can be viewed as the stable approach zone with the focus on ensuring that the aircraft is fully stabilized the area from ft to thrust can be viewed as the primary go zone where the focus shifts from tabi liz the aircraft to going around using rejected takeoff below maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action to stop the airplane within the accelerate stop distance as an analogy rejected takeoff below kt is considered to occur in different regime speed compared with rejected takeoff above kt high regime here through training and guidance there is shift in psychology for pilots operating in the low vs high regime similar shift can be realized through the approach to landing lowering the go execution altitude reduces the overall number of potential go by allowing low approaches to continue while at higher safer alti it makes the stable approach and go policies more in line with flight crews psychological beliefs and more manageable by management prevents risk transfer from low risk unstable approaches to potentially higher go and limits unnecessary demands on the air traffic system if not fully stable at or below this gate the decision to go around should be made without hesitation go below ft is not necessarily unsafe this determination depends on the degree and type of approach instability and aircraft type and performance characteristics this gate is essentially the beginning of the primary go zone from ft to thrust reverser deployment at this gate the low ala is addressed the most common types of low energy alas are landing short hard landing and tail strike if we analyze the most extreme case of low energy it is one where thrust is at flight idle speed is ref and the descent rate is fpm double normal rate of descent federal aviation regulations part says the landing configuration the steady gradient climb may not be less than percent with the engines at the power or thrust that is available eight seconds after initialization of move of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight idle to go power setting and design and construction of the engine must enable an increase from the fixed minimum flight idle power from not more than percent of rated takeoff power or thrust available to percent in not less than five seconds the most limiting of these two regulations is the eight requirement in our extreme low case of descending at fpm using linear anal without taking into consideration lessening of the rate of descent as engines spool and achieving climb gradient the flight will descend ft figure per min ft another useful analysis comes from flight safety foundation alar tool kit which says that an aircraft being flown on go while on approach path with thrust at flight idle descending at fpm and with ref at minus kt will experience an altitude loss of approximately ft safety foundation if we more than double the rate of descent to fpm in this analysis the aircraft would ex an altitude loss of approximately feet alar tool kit figure it is also interesting to look at design specifications for taws such as egp ws the technical standard order for such systems requires that for the final approach segment descent warning be given in time to allow for obstacle clear altitude after recovery that includes one pilot response time and standard gravitational accel era pull of transportation faa the tso further describes the altitude loss of an aircraft de at fpm with response time of one second and pull as being ft and says the required warning should be given no later than ft above the obstacle tso figure in comparison with these analyses gate of ft agl to execute go provides adequate altitude margin for even the most extreme low unstable approach the margin in this case results in percent increase over the linear eight part determination percent increase over the fsf alar determination and percent increase over the taws determination although the number of approach and landing accidents is greater than the number of go accidents the go around phase of flight has more fatalities per accident by ensuring safe altitude of ft to conduct go in the extreme unstable low case and by allowing low unstable approaches to continue between ft and ft the potential number of go would be reduced lower the exposure to go risks comparisons of revised gates to industry monitoring and alerting systems and faa runway overrun prevention references the project identified significant decision benefits in reducing the subjectivity of the decision analysis by flight crew the most impactful way to minimize subjectivity is to

source flight safety foundation tcas to help flight crews make timely and consistent decisions the industry has developed few systems in the form of stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems for approach and landing energy management the airbus runway overrun protection system has number of alerting and monitoring functions but those that are pertinent to this analysis are the visual alert that begins at ft agl and the aural alert at ft agl rop does present evaluation of aircraft real energy and the runway distance available for landing and provides visual too short alert at ft and an aural alert at ft jacob because of the lower altitudes at which these alerts occur and considering the severity of the condition that is not enough runway to stop the aircraft go really is the only option except in the most dire emergencies when comparing this condition to the conditions being applied to the proposed stabilized approach and go guidelines the fsf guide are quite conservative honeywell smart landing system also has many alerting and monitoring functions including aural alerts beginning at ft agl and ending at ft agl with an unstable alert the criteria used by the system to make the alert are variable but based on monitoring excessive approach angle excessive speed and flap settings honeywell intern again the altitudes where these alerts are given are similar to those recommended in the stabilized ap and go guidelines achieving collective situational awareness through active communication this project found that situational awareness is lacking among most flight crews who continue an unstable descent and land unstable communication is vital in achieving high situational awareness two key types of communication are recommended for improvements approach and landing brief and active communication sops throughout the approach pre approach and landing briefings and pre briefings most airlines already have procedures for briefings which ad the most important aspects of the approach and landing detailed guidance is provided in fsf alar briefing note safety foundation alar task force the following guidance is not intended to replace those briefings but is an addition to current standard briefing guidance improve overall ala awareness and improve awareness of specific approach and landing risks as demonstrated in the project data simply knowing few overall statistics can raise situational awareness igni fi when company statistics are available they should be referenced however in their absence the following industry statistics can be used alas make up approximately percent of all accidents approximately percent of unstable approaches result in go and more than percent of runway excursions follow stable approach that becomes unstable after threshold crossing additionally reviewing the effects of runway contamination and tail winds on runway excursions is relevant because they contribute to significant number of runway excursions the flight safety foundation runway safety initiative found that about percent of runway landing excursions are veer off of that percentage percent follow stable approaches of all veer percent were associated with wind and percent with runway contamination the remaining per of runway landing excursions are overruns and of that group percent follow unstable approaches safety foundation this project found that awareness of instabilities is crit important in the landing phase as well as in the approach phase some simple rules of thumb regarding the effect of poor landing technique on landing distance can significantly improve situational awareness for example pilots should plan for landing distances to in by ft per second of floating ft per kt excess speed from ref on dry runway ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet runway and ft per ft excess above ft over runway threshold this also applies when the vertical guidance for the ap by design places the aircraft higher than ft agl when crossing the threshold landing distances are based on threshold crossing briefings including these statistics and rules of thumb should occur at intervals that will ensure that flight crews have an in depth awareness of the information for example bi briefings also should discuss any allowances for flight crews to adjust company policies discussion in safe landing guidelines as permitted by guided procedures in the policies themselves for example allowing crew to conduct touchdown beyond the normal approach and landing and pre briefing guidance pre briefing should include in addition to existing approach briefing components an emphasis on approach and landing threats when available company statistics should be used periodically bi the briefing should include approach and landing accident statistics overall statistics alas make up approximately percent of all accidents approximately percent of runway excursions develop from approaches that become unstable after threshold crossing and approximately percent of unstable approaches or unstable landings result in go runway excursion environmental contributors percent of landing excursions are veer with wind factor in percent and runway contam nation factor in percent about percent of veer follow stable approaches and percent of landing excursions are overruns of these percent follow unstable approaches landing distance increase rules of thumb ft per second of floating ft per kt excess speed from ref landing speed on dry runway ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet runway and ft per ft excess above ft over runway threshold for each approach briefing should include environmental ala threats contamination crosswind tail winds go readiness in addition to normal go briefing heightened readiness should be discussed in the event of poor environmental conditions and any adjustments to approach and landing policy requirements as permitted by written policy guidance landing beyond the normal touchdown zone if performance permits pre briefing at an appropriate low period just prior to commencing the approach crews should recap current environmental threats go readiness and any adjustments to go policy procedures source flight safety foundation touchdown zone as long as adequate landing performance and distance references exist finally as pre briefings often occur minutes or more before an approach the project findings and recommend suggest that short update or refreshment of the current threats and go readiness be briefed just prior to the ap during low period in the lower descent this can refresh and up flight crews situational awareness pre approach and landing and pre briefing guidance active communication throughout the approach this project determined that communication is one of the key attributes of effective collaborative decision making by flight crews by factor of approximately four flight crews who comply with their company go policy had comm uni about approach instabilities and for most crews who con an unstable approach and landing no one made the actual decision to continue that is there was no communication about the decision to continue it just happened the difficulty with passive calls which are made only if prob condition exists is that in their absence it is undetermined if the condition exists the call could be absent for several reasons as explained in the report findings active calls however force flight crews to speak discuss or express condition either positive or negative on every approach it is also important not to overload the flight crew with standard communication and to ensure that they have time to listen to atc and perform other tasks therefore active calls must be short and direct calls are usually initiated by the pm and responded to by the pf the pm call on the approach normally indicates condition and the response by the pf may either be an ac or directional response it is recommended that there be an active call at each ap gate if the active call indicates an undesired aircraft state the call should continue to be made periodically throughout the approach at intervals such as each ft or ft until the desired state is achieved or go is conducted this serves the same purpose as warning from egp ws or tcas active repetitive calls in the to zone also pre the pf for an eventual conclusion if the offending co ndi is not corrected that is go repetitive warning calls prime the pf anticipatory compensatory hierarch and relational awareness es as compared with common current procedures in which sudden single go around call is made at or ft which has lesser ef in primarily the hierarchical awareness the implementation of active calls should not imply that passive and communicative calls such as or be omitted passive calls remain an important component of situational awareness and should be used in combination with active calls as required the following are examples of active calls at approach gates during an approach if an airline has stable approach and monitoring system installed such as rop or smart landing the need for complete series of active calls throughout the approach and landing is largely removed these systems apply passive conditional calls however the nature of the automation provides form of reliability that passive calls from flight crews do not gate pm active call pf response ft agl con con or ft agl stabilized stabilized or ft agl stabilized around or to go around around agl above

touchdown aim point in reference to the available landing area as follows available landing area touchdown aim point touchdown aim point markings are white rectangular stripes one on each side of the runway centerline that begin at the distances indicated above the width of the aim markings varies with the width of the runway source flight safety foundation fsf safe landing guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind the revised flight safety foundation guidelines for safe landing and achieving reliable go decision making during the landing phase as with the stable approach and go decision guidelines there were several objectives namely that the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and manage to improve agreement with the policy ensure safety during landing by mitigating the common types of alas landing runway excursions and veer ensure the resultant go are in situations of ap risk and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to go maneuver increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on atc and improve the flight crew collective situational awareness the guidelines established here do not replace manufacturer limitations and procedural guidance or state regulations and guidance excursions that occur following an unstable approach are mitigated largely in the approach phase however they can still prevented in the landing phase additionally large numbers of excursions occur following stable approach that becomes unstable only after the aircraft passes the runway thresh guidelines in this section are targeted at these types of excursions landing excursions are of two types overruns in which aircraft run off the end of the runway surface and veer in which aircraft exit the side of the runway surface to address these types of alas we will enhance landing guidelines in four areas longitudinal limit awareness touchdown zone and distance lateral limit awareness centerline environmental variability and adjustments to established policies and situational awareness and communication project findings include that collective situational awareness is low during the landing phase and although most opera have policies defining where the touchdown should occur very few have guidance or sops on how to determine where the touchdown occurs or how and when to determine if go around should be executed for example most operators spec that the aircraft should touch down in the touchdown zone on the centerline however they do not train or specify how to determine if the aircraft has passed the dz who should make the determination or how much of deviation from the runway centerline is permissible before go should be conducted most pilots say either gut feeling or experience helps them judge when an aircraft has passed the acceptable limit even though they readily state that their experience does not include go from the landing phase the impact of improving collective situational awareness in the landing phase can be significant longitudinal limit awareness dz and distance touchdown zones vary in length with one determining factor being total runway length runways of ft and longer have touchdown zones ft long and runways of and longer have touchdown zones long relative positioning markings are present within the dz and are clearly identifiable on non runway the aiming point is the widest marking located at the distance from the threshold and distance from the threshold with the end of the dz being identified by the last marking at ft and approach alerting and monitoring systems such as smart provide aural alerts when an aircraft has passed company touchdown area when an aircraft passes this area without touching down an aural alert such as landing deep landing is given honeywell international sops then dictate go this objective warning immediately enhances crew awareness and leads to better decision making in the absence of such system the pm through sops can be directed to monitor the passing of dz markings and make an active call such as limit landing or of zone after passing the last marking indicating the passage of the dz in cases in which the runway is contaminated and markings are not visible couple of options exist if available runway remaining markers can be used or using the landing distance of thumb pilots can calculate that for an aircraft traveling ft per second the normal touchdown area of to ft will occur in four to eight seconds fps seconds to ft calculations also will show that the end of the dz will pass in approximately seconds ft fps seconds lateral limit awareness centerline most operators specify that the touchdown shall occur on the runway centerline but do not say how this will hap or who will determine when the aircraft is drifting as important as it is to have situational awareness regarding longitudinal limit it is equally important to understand lateral limits manufacturers often provide cockpit visual cues and techniques for determining where the main landing gear is in relation to the aircraft centerline as an example boeing says that for the the view through lower outboard corner of the pilot forward win to the ground is good visual reference for the outboard side of the main landing gear wheels on the same side the lower inboard corner of the pilot forward window is also good reference for the opposite side main gear wheels boeing company in the absence of other lateral limits maintaining the most outboard main landing gears on either side of the centerline is reasonable limit using visual cues as in the example above can help determine the positioning of the main landing gear this is considered rough operational guide with its own limitations however there are no known alternatives other than relying on sense the monitor of this positioning can be performed by the pm during the landing and if he or she sees that the position of the aircraft is incorrect he can make an appropriate call limit in that case sops would dictate go environmental variability and adjustments to established policies environmental variability can have significant effect on land performance and desired touchdown points operators should consider giving flight crews the tools and guidelines to determine when it makes sense to modify or adjust landing and go policies for safety and possibly operational efficiency it can be difficult for some operators to consider allowing crew to land beyond the dz however landing performance combined with sound guidance and policies for operating outside normal definitions makes sense when safe operations are assured over we also have the problem of rules with no room to apply judgment kern said in book of these policies begin with good intent but inside the good intent we create systems that defy logic and poison the well of fairness which often results in an unintended consequence loss of faith in the system of rules problems can develop when environmental conditions are such that operating outside established policies makes sense but there are no guiding principles on how to accomplish this for example an aircraft landing on run requires landing distance although the company policy states that go should be initiated if touchdown does not occur inside the dz is it the best course of action as opposed to an option of extending the touchdown point to ft km for example certainly the answer is yes if the mark is not definable however if the flight crew can identify this point and if they have briefed the revision to the policy is it still the best course of action to go around in this case the transfer of risk to go is questionable revised touchdown point can be determined by citing known distance point along the runway taxi marking runway distance marker or time period one second approximates ft in distance in another case in which weather and runway conditions demand that touchdown occur before the end of the dz guid should give crews the methods and means to identify the shorter touchdown limit for example if the crew wants to be touching down within ft of the runway thresh they need references to determine where this will occur using dz markings or time lapse seconds from the time the aircraft crosses the threshold in any case written policies and guidance must be in place to give the flight crew permission procedures and techniques to modify landing point limit this should be briefed and agreed upon by all crew figure approach and landing gates and active calls end of dz of zone of zone deep landing window stabilized go window stabilized not stabilized window con not con dz touchdown zone calls can be substituted with auto callout such as minimums above source flight safety foundation situational awareness and communication figure shows examples of new active com munic calls recommended in the landing phase of flight in the case of exceeding centerline touchdown limit it is difficult to define point in the dz where positive centerline active call can be made although not ideal in this case the use of passive call may be more operational that is the call is made only when the drift limit is reached note that stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems accomplish the objectives of some active calls therefore flight crew calls would not be required

aircraft fueling trucks during fuel servicing or de fueling operations the customer stated that the ramp at his airport is being repaved and grounding points are not being re installed in recent years there has been change in philosophy and practice with regard to grounding in the edition of the national fire protection association standard for aircraft fuel servicing the requirements for ground ing were deleted and requirements for bonding were clarified the practice in the united states has been to bond and ground but tests have proven that if the aircraft and fuel truck are properly bonded grounding wire carries no electrical charge at all this is why nfpa no longer specifies grounding for safety during aircraft fueling the nfpa determination was based on the following points grounding does not prevent sparking at the fuel surface grounding is not required per nfpa recommended practice on static electricity static electrical grounding points can have high resistance making them unsuitable for grounding the wire used for grounding might not be capable of conducting current in the event of an electrical fault in the ground support equipment connected to the aircraft and could become an ignition source if the wire fuses the gulf stream ground handling and servicing handbooks and aircraft maintenance manuals have removed the grounding requirement and call only for bonding

aircraft powered down and the battery ci cuit breaker closed depressing one of the entry light switches causes the controller to power up on aircraft atte ry power initiate minute countdown timer and turn on the associated light within the aircraft the deviation between the electrical drawing note and actual op ration comes about as result of the length of time that the switch is depressed the

long as the airplane remains within the protected airspace the recommendation is based on three types of entries depending on the sector from which the airplane arri ve at the holding fix these are the direct parallel and tear instrument ground school instrument ground school holding patterns standard holding pattern turns made to right inbound leg of holding pattern is minute at below ft and minutes above ft leg should be adjusted to yield minute inbound leg of the outbound leg should begin either abeam the fix or after completing the outbound turn holding pattern has fix direction to hold from the fix and an airway bearing course radial or route on which the aircraft is to hold instrument ground school holding patterns dme leg length may be used instead of time for holding patterns used dme leg length refers to the outbound leg length instrument ground school holding patterns you should triple the crosswind correction needed on the inbound leg to determine the outbound leg heading instrument ground school speed limits maximum holding speeds are established to keep aircraft within the protected holding area during their one and half above msl inbound and outbound legs for civil aircraft in the united states these airspeeds are to msl kias from to msl kias msl and above kias the icao maximum holding speeds to to to above with their higher performance characteristics military aircraft have higher holding speed limits instrument ground school direct entry is performed exactly as it sounds the aircraft flies directly to the holding fix and immediately begins the first turn outbound parallel entry the aircraft flies to the holding fix parallels the inbound course for one minute outbound and then turns back flies directly to the fix and continues in the hold from there an offset or teardrop entry the aircraft flies to the holding fix turns into the protected area flies for one minute and then turns back inbound proceeds to the fix and continues from there out ube instrument ground school holding clearance holding clearance is give at least minutes before arriving at the clearance limit or fix if the holding pattern assigned by atc is depicted on your aeronautical hart you are expected to hold as published unless advised otherwise by atc holding clearance includes from the fix of the fix length appropriate direction of tu rn if left turns are required further clearance time you lose comm the ef allows you to exit the holding pattern at definite time the last lap of the holding patter to be at the fix as close as possible

smooth out the traffic flow may request hold for example to wait for weather conditions to improve pattern size is directly proportional to aircraft speed your speed double the size of the holding pattern are to the right in standard hol ding patterns and to the left in nonstandard holding patters circuit of the holding pattern begins and ends at the holding fix the timing of you outbound leg to make your inbound leg one minute long correct for crosswind drift in the holding pattern triple your inbound wind correction angel on the outbound leg keep the volume of the protected airspace for

recommended are direct teardrop and parallel holding clearance should always con tai holding direction holding fix and expect further clearance time if the holding pattern is not published the

operating costs boeing cruise performance monitoring in addition to what might be considered its more common use of deter planning and fmc performance factors cruise performance monitoring can help airlines identify and solve in performance problems often performance monitoring will identify need for boeing to assist in determining the solution to given in problem however with good understanding of the monitoring process and the interactions among the variables involved airlines heir own problem diagnosing and solving cruise performance monitoring has been used for many years by airlines that strive to operate their airplanes as ef as possible these airlines know that continuous cruise performance monitoring of airplanes in their can decrease operating costs relative to airlines that do not monitor airplane performance levels continuous cruise performance monitoring can give airlines the information they need to just the baseline performance levels they use for planning and management computer mc fuel predictions so that the correct amount of fuel is loaded on each and every entify normal deterioration for of airplanes at ch the airplanes that perform best to their longest routes entify high fuel burning airplanes for possible maintenance validate performance degradation for extended twin operations top critical fuel reserves planning lieu of the regulatory requirement of percent fuel mileage deterioration allowance crease crew con in plans and possibly decrease the amount of discretionary fuel requested and loaded an additional less recognized bene of cruise performance monitoring is diagnosing and solving various airplane performance problems or issues these case studies show how cruise performance monitoring was used to determine solutions to three different problems an airline that operates airplane was concerned about what it considered to be exc ive fuel mileage deterioration relative to the fuel mileage levels its airplanes exhibited when they were new the airline requested help from both boeing and the engine manufacturer in de te mining what was causing this deterioration the airframe the engine or both through better understanding of the contributions that airframe and engine deterioration make to the overall fuel mileage deterioration the airline could more ef focus its maintenance resources to help resolve this issue the airline proposed an experiment involving an engine exchange airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration by dave anderson flight operations engineer and carolyn han reiter aerodynamics engineer aero quarterly qtr ew total fuel mileage diff er ence ol to ne airplane using he ol an ne engine between an old and new airplane six which was operating about percent below the planning database level of fuel mileage represented the old airplane while soon represented the new one the airline requested assistance and support from boeing and the engine manufacturer in carrying out the experiment which would ea sure pre fuel mileage on both the new and the old airplane swap swap all four engines between the new and old airplane ea sure fuel mileage again on both the new and the old airplane swap by using the same physical set of four engines on two different airframes the airline boeing and the engine manufacturer agreed that any measurable difference in fuel mileage for the same set of engines on two different airframes could be attributed to airframe effects alone that is drag deterioration boeing position was that proper maintenance of the exterior of an airplane would lead to minimal amounts of drag deterioration as an airplane ages as result the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including con inspection so that it would be considered as having properly maintained exterior before the engine swap control surfaces were re rigged seals were repaired and one engine was replaced minor leak in the pneumatic system discovered during the was not by the airline to cause about percent penalty in fuel mileage fuel mileage data was collected before and after the to determine any change across the check especially to quantify any changes resulting from re rigging the control surfaces and replacing any worn seals fuel mileage improved percent after the with percent attributed to proper re rigging of the controls and percent attributed to the changing of one engine fuel mileage data was then collected on both the old and new airplanes before and after the engine swap the data collected was combination of in data collected by the airplane condition monitoring system acm and hand data that was collected under more controlled test conditions average results from all four sets of data were then compared to determine the differences in fuel mileage between the old and new airplanes with the same set of engines for both the old and new engines the average improvement in fuel mileage for the new airframe relative to the old airframe was about percent the initial conclusion could be that the older airframe must contribute about percent toward the overall fuel mileage deterioration originally observed on the old airplane and engine combination however about percent of that difference is explainable of the total calculated difference of percent the pneumatic duct leakage discovered on the old airplane during the contributed about percent in addition the old airplane did not have the same revised vertical fairing as the new if the older airplane had had the newer vertical fairing it is estimated that the fuel mileage would have improved about percent after adjusting for the pneumatic system leak and the newer vertical fairing for the same set of engines the old airplane fuel mileage averaged about percent worse than the new airplane the results are supportive of the position that the drag deterioration of well airplane most likely will not exceed more than about percent the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including cong ration inspection boeing ne vertical fin fairing pneumatic leakage actual unexplainable diff er ence case study to help determine the primary cause of the fuel mileage deterioration boeing and the airline collected fuel mileage data on both new and old before and after an engine exchange an airline expressed concern to boeing that its new cfm airplanes equipped with aviation partners boeing apb blended winglets were exhibiting fuel mileage performance more than percent worse than the boeing database level while its older non winglet approximately two years old displayed fuel mileage performance similar to the database level the airline which collects cruise fuel mileage data on an ongoing basis based its analysis on acm cruise fuel mileage data analyzed using the boeing airplane performance monitoring apm program in initial discussions between boeing and the airline it was explained that the database being used by the airline to represent the with blended winglets was based on the original winglet test results completed in early this is the same database used in the flight crew operations manual the mc and the operational planning database additional tests had led to boeing latest best assessment of the delivered performance of the winglets which showed slightly less improvement than the original testing this revised database based on several add ition al test programs conducted in and includes different winglet drag increment to non winglet and an aer elastic correction absent in the earlier database at mach the difference between the two databases varies from percent to percent depending on the exact conditions with the airline database predicting better fuel mileage increment because of the winglets in all cases upon request the airline provided boeing with acm data for two of its airplanes with blended winglets boeing analyzed the data for each airplane using both the operational database and the revised database while the data was on average about percent closer to the newer database level than the operational database level boeing analysis did not agree with the airline analysis boeing analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the airline further discussions with the airline revealed that it had been using passenger weight allo ance of kg per passenger including carry baggage and kg per checked bag for all of its as of june the airline changed to the higher passenger weight allowances recommended in the joint aviation requirements operations ar checked baggage would be weighed whenever possible otherwise ar checked baggage weight allowances would be used the average passenger weight allowances are igni higher than the kg per passenger the airline had been using because the data sent to boeing for the two winglet airplanes was collected prior to june it was based on the lighter weight allowance of kg per investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall boeing analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the airline aero quarterly qtr passenger the airline analysis was based on data using combination of the weight allowances as the investigation continued the airline sent additional data to boeing for the same two winglet airplanes but only for conditions recorded after june based on the higher jar weight allowances the airline also included data for one more winglet airplane as well as for three non winglet airplanes the data for the two winglet airplanes showed an immediate fuel mileage improvement of about percent for each airplane based on analyzing only the data from ar weight allowances collected after june this result led quickly to the belief that the previous kg per passenger weight allowance was too light although both the fuel mileage and thrust required changed igni between data based on kg per passenger and data based on ar passenger weight allowances the thrust fuel consumption tsf hardly changed errors in the estimated weight of an airplane present themselves as high or low drag but do not affect the fuel tsf deviations calculated by apm igni improvement was observed for both of the winglet airplanes originally analyzed with data recorded before june the results for all six airplanes were still not as good as what boeing experience indicated for this model further investigation determined that this airline operates its of in mix of both scheduled and holiday charter using the spec ar weight allowances called out for each the data sent to boeing for the six airplanes included mixture of data from both these types of the average passenger weight allowance recommended for scheduled service is kg per passenger and kg per passenger for charter service are higher than the kg per passenger originally used by the airline at boeing request the airline separated all of the post june data into two groups charter service and scheduled service the data for each group was reanalyzed separately and the analysis revealed igni discrepancy in demonstrated fuel mileage and thrust levels between the charter and scheduled if airplane weight is underestimated perceived airplane performance will be poorer than expected weight that is unaccounted for shows up as increased airplane drag and decreased fuel mileage in this analysis the tsf deviations remained consistent between both sets of data but the thrust deviations increased igni for the charter strong indication of unaccounted airplane weight in this situation boeing proposed that the jar passenger weight allowances as recommended for holiday charter were underestimating the airplane weight for this particular airline charter operations although the airline was receptive to the possibility that the ar passenger weight allowances might be too light for its holiday charter it was not fully convinced the airline believed that the ar weight allowances for scheduled could just as easily be incorrect in which case their airplanes were performing as poorly as the charter data indicated to determine which weight allowances were correct the airline and boeing agreed to collect delivery performance data on the airline next new airplane delivery with production blended winglets installed the advantages of collecting delivery data as opposed to in data are he performance level of the airplane could be established at delivery he airplane would be weighed at the boeing factory with all the weight changes following weighing but preceding delivery accurately tracked and published in the weight and balance manual therefore the delivery empty weight could be considered accurate delivery are with minimum crew so the issue of passenger weight allowances would not exist after collecting cruise performance data on the delivery the airline would continue with its standard in data collection on both scheduled and charter comparing the results from the delivery with the results obtained in would help determine which jar passenger weight allowances gave the airline more accurate airplane gross weights if the weight allowances were too heavy airplane was actually lighter than estimated then the in performance would appear to be better than the delivery performance if the weight allowances were too light airplane was heavier than estimated then the in performance would appear to be worse than the delivery level the airline provided boeing with the weeks of acm in data for the airplane following delivery separating the data for charter and scheduled for this analysis the data was analyzed relative to the most recent with winglets database although the delivery results showed the airplane to be slightly better than the demonstrated database level the early in charter results show the airplane with an average per fuel mileage percent worse than the demonstrated level unaccounted weight shows up as airplane drag required according to the charter data the airplane experienced percent increase in thrust required on entering service partially offset by percent drop in engine tsf for percent drop in fuel mileage from the delivery level when the same ai plane scheduled service data for the same time period was analyzed the fuel mileage was much closer to the delivery level average in fuel mileage for the weeks of operation deviated from the delivery level by only percent percent below the demonstrated level which is within the acm ability to determine fuel mileage over given time period these results supported the conclusion that for this airline the ar passenger weight allo ance for scheduled more accurately re the true weight of the passengers plus carry baggage than the weight allowances recommended for the charter in addition both are much more representative than the original kg per passenger the airline had been using the weight allowances for scheduled of kg per

structural reinforcement of the wing followed by installation of the winglet eleven of the airplanes had the wing reinforcement completed many weeks before the winglets were installed with the airplanes returning to service with the reinforced wings for these airplanes the non winglet data was based on this reinforced wing con three of the airplanes had the wing reinforced and winglet installed at the same time for these three airplanes the non winglet data was based on the production non reinforced wing the two sets of data were analyzed separately in order to identify any differences in the improvement based on differences in the baseline before the winglets were installed boeing analyzed the data for all airplanes using the same in software tools used to analyze boeing data these software tools are different from the apm software provided to airline customers but the analysis produces basically the same results the main difference is that the boeing in software normalizes the data points to nominal weight to pressure ratios chosen by boeing while the apm software does not the improvements were plotted versus in order to illustrate that the magnitude of the improvement depends on for given mach number this dependency on is because the winglet improvement is function of airplane lift coef which in turn is function of weight altitude and speed the

results indicated this improve to be relatively small but still worth an average of few tenths of percentage at normal cruise weights and altitudes including the effects of both the wing strengthening and the addition of the winglets the fuel mileage and drag improve closely matched their predicted levels because the improvement in drag is fun of for given cruise speed the actual improvement in

the improvement in fuel mileage offset by any increase in airplane weight retro the winglets to the including wing reinforcement currently adds about kg to the empty weight of the airplane and this additional weight alone would increase fuel burn approximately percent to percent for an average leg an analysis similar to the boeing analysis could have been carried out by the airline itself using

represent airlines have asked boeing for help in reducing this cost recent results show that changing the way service bulletins are prepared and delivered combined with airline process improvements can reduce maintenance cosy and improve the ability to show conformance boeing has continually made enhancements to the content format and delivery of its service bulletins past enhancements include digital delivery simp li english and tabular work instructions boeing has been working directly with airlines to reduce end costs for service bulletin incorporation during this process it was observed that when airlines create their engineering orders they rewrite or re engineer service bulletins and re kit or repackage the kit of parts to match their own engineering orders this re engineering causes unnecessary delays and expense for the airlines in implementing service bulletins boeing developed the enhanced service bulletin also known as the generation service bulletin to minimize this re engineering effort while making it easier and less expensive to implement service bulletins the enhanced service bulletin in conjunction with airline process improvements will enable smooth work ensuring that information parts and tools are staged in coordinated manner to support the mechanic during service bulletin incorporation boeing enhanced service bulletins incorporate four key features

airplane structure and systems over their lifetimes as result of this approach the basic airplane will have percent lower airframe maintenance costs than any comparable product and will be available for revenue service more often than any other commercial airplane the boeing program has consciously designed in new state features and performance that reduce cost and increase airplane availability these features will lead to additional savings and greater revenue for boeing customers the re new life design philosophy that has dictated some igni changes in the way the airplane will be built these changes include extensive use of composites in the airframe and primary structure an electric systems architecture reliable and maintainable design and an improved maintenance program taken together these changes will offer customers guaranteed reduction in maintenance costs the life cost approach to design looks at the total cost picture for design options by examining all of the factors that affect an airplane over its lifetime traditionally the value of given design solution has been measured using factors such as drag weight oise and community schedule reliability development cost uil cost using these measures to compare design options helps determine the optimum choice with the boeing has expanded the life design approach by adding two unique performance measures maintenance cost and airplane availability clearly looking at the cost to maintain systems over their lifetimes becomes igni factor when attempting to understand the total effect of design decision on an operator cost structure airplane availability includes not only schedule reliability but also other factors such as the length of time an airplane must be out when maintenance is required obviously taking an airplane out of service for two days has much bigger effect on operator revenue than taking it out of service for two hours boeing from the ground upby justin hale deputy chief mechanic aero quarterly qtr advanced composites aluminum titanium steel landing gear boeing makes greater use of composite materials in its airframe and primary structure than any previous boeing commercial airplane under the design process without preconceived ideas enabled boeing engineers to specify the optimum material for spec applications throughout the airframe the result is an airframe comprising nearly half carbon reinforced plastic and other composites this approach offers weight savings on average of percent compared to more conventional aluminum designs selecting the optimum material for spec application meant analyzing every area of the airframe to determine the best material given the operating environment and loads that component experiences over the life of the airframe for example aluminum is sensitive to tension loads but handles compression very well on the other hand composites are not as ef in dealing with compression loads but are excellent at handling tension the expanded use of composites especially in the highly tension environment of the fuselage greatly reduces maintenance due to fatigue when compared with an aluminum structure this type of analysis has resulted in an increased use of titanium as well where loading indicates metal is preferred material system but environmental considerations indicate aluminum is poor choice titanium is an excellent low design solution titanium can withstand comparable loads better than aluminum has minimal fatigue con and is highly resistant to corrosion titanium use has been expanded on the to roughly percent of the total airframe every structural element of the has undergone this type of life analysis and material types are based on thorough and disciplined selection process how co

airlines would repair an airplane today with bolted repairs these can be just as permanent and damage tolerant as they are on metal structure boeing in addition to lowering the overall airplane weight moving to composite primary structure promises to reduce both the scheduled and nonroutine maintenance burden on the airlines reduced scheduled maintenance ex per ence with the boeing proves that composite str ct ure require less scheduled maintenance than noncom structures for example the composite tail is percent larger than the aluminum tail yet requires percent fewer scheduled maintenance labor hours this labor hour reduction is due to the result of reduced risk of corrosion and fatigue of composites compared with metal reduced nonroutine maintenance com structure also results in less nonroutine maintenance the structure is all composite and highlights the advantages of this material when applied in harsh environ airline operators are aware of the fatigue cracking and corrosion dif experienced with traditional aluminum beams the model has been for more than years with more than airplanes in the and to date has not replaced single composite beam boeing has also implemented rigorous process for evaluating the use of aluminum that combines likelihood of corrosion with consequence of corrosion this scoring system provides de measure for establishing acceptable application of aluminum in the design with full understanding of the maintenance implications corrosion and fatigue in structure add igni to the nonroutine maintenance burden on an operator nonroutine maintenance frequently double or even triples the total labor hours expended during maintenance check with the expanded use of composites and titanium combined with greater discipline in usage of aluminum boeing expects the to have much lower nonroutine labor costs than more conventional metallic airframe in addition to using robust structural design in damage areas such as passenger and cargo doors the has been designed from the start with the capability to be repaired in exactly the same manner that airlines would repair an airplane today with bolted repairs the ability to perform bolted repairs in composite structure is service on the and offers comparable repair times and skills as employed on metallic airplanes by design bolted repairs in composite structure can be permanent and damage tolerant just as they can be on metal structure in addition airlines have the option to perform bonded composite repairs which offer improved aerodynamic and aesthetic these repairs are permanent damage tolerant and do not require an autoclave while typical bonded repair may require or more hours of airplane downtime boeing has taken advantage of the properties of composites to develop new line of maintenance repair capability that requires less the right material for the right application without preconceived ideas boeing engineers were able to specify the optimum material for spec applications throughout the airframe aero quarterly qtr than an hour to apply this rapid composite repair technique offers temporary repair capability to get an airplane again quickly despite minor

consists of panel mounted kln and ka gps antenna an altitude input is required to obtain full navigation and operational capabilities additional system components may be added or interfaced to the kln which increase its features and capabilities some of these optional compo ne nts include an external course deviation indicator or horizontal situation indicator autopilot and external an nuncia tors typically an altitude input an external indicator and external annunciators are required for ifr approach certification kln panel mounted unit contains the gps sensor the navigation computer gas plasma discharge display and all con rol required to operate the unit it also includes the data base card which slides into the left side of the front panel ka gps antenna is available for use with the kln it is designed to always be mounted on the top of the aircraft kln has analog outputs to drive the left deviation bar of most mechanical cdi and hsi in addition the nav mode of the bendix fc ka ka ka fc ka fc fc fc and fc flight control systems may be coupled to the kln many other autopilots may also be coupled to the kln actual autopilot performance and capability when coupled to the kln may vary significantly from one autopilot model to another may be provided to the kln from an encoding al time ter or blind encoder altitude is used as an aid in position determination when not enough satellites are in view all ifr installations require remote annunciators to be mounted in the aircraft panel in order to select and indicate the status of certain kln functions en route and terminal ifr certifications require annunciators for message and way point alert non precision approach certifications also require switch to select and display when the approach mode is armed or active each kln system includes configuration module which is attached to the kln mounting rack the module allows the kln to be configured for the unique characteristics of your equipment installation parameters that are set by the configuration module include the kln may be used for ifr operations or not if it may be used for non approach ifr operations kln may only be used for vfr navigation or not the

north americas south data base coverage areas figure kln data base geographical region kln pilot guided ata base base chapter data base data basics the data base provides two primary functions first it makes pilot interface with the gps sensor much easier rather than having to manually look up and then enter the latitude and longitude for spe ci fic way point it allows you to merely enter simple way point identifier the data base automatically looks up and displays the lati tude and longitude associated with the identifier it should be obvious that the data base saves lot of tedious latitude entry and also greatly reduces the potential for data input mistakes second function of the data base is that it serves as very con means to store and easily access aeronautical information want to know the name of the airport the nearest city or the airport elevation just unleash the power of the kln and display the information right on the screen the kln data base stores non approaches in their proper sequence this allows you to select an approach as whole rather than entering the approach way point by way point data base contents and coverage areas there are four data base coverage areas available for the kln they are referred to as the north data base the south data base the data base and the data base international civil aviation organization and aeronautical radio inc break the world into the ten geographic regions shown in figure the kln americas north data base con tains aeronautical information for the group of icao regions consisting of canada usa and latin america the kln americas south data base contains aeronautical information for the group of icao regions consisting of usa latin america and south america the kln atlantic data base provides information for

training warning user defined way points identifier latitude and longitude icao identifiers way points are stored in the kln database almost exclusively by their icao identifiers icao civil aviation organization is an internationally accepted reference for the data in almost all cases the proper icao identifiers may be taken directly from eppes en or nos aeronautical charts identifiers in the contiguous united states alaska and canada are special cases in the icao system many airport ident fie rs for these areas have four letters beginning with prefix letter that corresponds to the geographic area in which it is located the prefix letter for the contiguous is thus the identifier for dallas worth international airport is dfw not dfw would be identical to the vor identifier likewise the identifier for orlando executive airport is kor while the vor identifier is orl the prefix letter for canada is and for alaska is there are several exceptions in alaska in many cases air ports with three letter identifiers receive the prefix but there are many that don the most reliable method of determining an alaska airport identifier is to look it up from the airport name or city see sec tion way points by name or city you can program the kln to default to certain letter as when you are entering way point identifier see section entry to learn about this handy feature all airport identifiers receive the prefix letter airport identifiers which are combinations of letters and numbers do not apply to the prefix rule examples of airport identifiers not using the prefix are and remember if you are entering or looking for an airport ident fie that is all letters numbers then it will begin with prefix in the contiguous in alaska some cases or in canada if there are numbers in the identifier then prefix is not used for other areas of the world the airport iden ti fie stored in the kln data base is identical to how it is charted updating the data base the information stored in the data base would eventually become obsolete if there wasn some means to update it for example new airports open navaids can move or change frequency com munic tion frequencies can change and on and on base base chapter by faa regulation you are required to have current data base in order to use the kln for non approach data base is contained in small card which plugs into the left side of the kln front panel it is designed so that there are two ways for the user to easily keep the data base current the first is to electronically update the data base by means of diskette supplied by honeywell and an ibm personal computer this method does not have to involve removing the kln from the aircraft instrument panel jack usually mounted in the air craft instrument panel provides means of interfacing the kln with the computer via an interface cable the diskettes are not returned to honeywell second method of data base update is to remove the old card and insert current card this method involves returning the old card to honeywell days honeywell receives new nav data from eppes en sanderson this information is processed and down loaded onto both diskettes and data base cards honeywell makes these two types of update services available to you in choice of several subscription or random update programs see section for details on these programs sends the update so that it arrives prior to the next effective date the new update may be installed any time prior to the effective date and the kln will use the previous data up to the effective date and automatically begin using the new data on the effective date warning the accuracy of the data base information is only assured if it is used before the end of the effectivity period use of out of date data base information is done entirely at the user own risk computer updating of the data base update information is sent to you on disks in order to use the update program you must have access to computer having disk drive capable utilizing megabyte high density diskettes this computer also needs to have an available com or com ser ial port if you wish to perform updates in the cockpit an optional pc interface kit must be used included in the kit is an interface cable that plugs into both the computer and into the data loader jack the data loader jack is included with the kln installation kit and is typically installed in the aircraft instrument panel pilot guided ata base base chapter data base base chapter the data base must be updated only while the air craft is on the ground the kln does not perform any navigation function while the data base is being updated since data base update takes approximately minutes it is good idea to turn off all electrical equipment on the aircraft except for the kln to avoid running down the aircraft battery diskettes sent to you can only be used to update one kln although they can update that specific unit numerous times the first time the diskettes are used in an update operation unique identification code from the kln being used is uploaded to the diskettes these diskettes may be used in this specific kln an unlimited number of times which could be required if you switch back and forth between the americas north americas south atlantic and pacific data bases during one update cycle these diskettes may not however be used to update other kln this update protection ensures that eppes en sanderson is properly compensated for the use of their nav data update the kln data base by computer the pin female connector end of the interface cable into com serial port of the computer if the computer has com and com serial ports either may be used some computers use pin com serial port connector while other computers use pin connector if the computer being used has pin connector the interface cable connector will plug directly into the computer pin connector if the computer com serial port uses pin connector use the pin to pin adapter included in the pc interface kit to adapt the interface cable connector to the computer connector you are using the pc interface kit in the cockpit plug the other end of the interface cable conductor male connector into the data loader jack that is mounted in the aircraft panel the diskette into the computer disk drive turn on the computer being used for the data base update the

the time to first fix will usually be less than two minutes if this information is not correct then the kln will start to look for any satellites eventually the kln will find enough satellites to

well acquainted this will allow you to utilize it to the maximum extent great way to get to know the kln is to use it outside the airplane using what we call the mode are products available which allow you to use the kln at your home office or hotel to have get time in the take mode for instance the commander from lone star aviation it is also helpful to do flight planning and perform data base updates outside the airplane perhaps with home personal computer more information on the commander or to place an order con star aviation corp tatum drive arlington tx phone fax the kln is in the

initialized to on the setup page section and time to first fix in addition ground speed and heading may be entered on the set page and the kln will track flight plan or direct to way point just as if it was actually functioning in an aircraft distances count down way points sequence and the devi tion bar follows the progress of the simulated flight using the take mode is an excellent way to learn the operation of the kln without worrying about the engine running other traffic or even terrain fortunately these phenomena are not simulated in the take mode kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid approaches and sid only this is the last chapter on the operation of the kln in this chapter you will learn how to use the kln for non approach and sid procedures note that only kln which are configured for ifr approaches are capable of performing the procedures discussed in this chapter kln which are con figured for en route and terminal operations only will give you access to sid procedures but not non procedures all of these procedures require that you are comfortable with the operation of the unit as presented up to this point in particular you need to be comfortable with flight plan operation and and the obs mode non approach operations flying non approaches using the kln are not in them selves very difficult however it is different than using traditional equipment such as vor and ndb with this in mind make sure that you practice with the kln in vfr weather with check pilot before attempting to use the kln in actual ifr conditions the kln obtains approach information from the data base therefore it is extremely important that the data base is current the kln is approved for ifr non approaches only when the data base is current if you attempt to select an approach when the data base is out of date you will be given the status message base expire in the bottom left portion of the screen as reminder following sections assume that your kln is properly installed in the aircraft with all of the necessary accessories to fly non approaches in most cases this will mean that the air craft has external switch to arm the approach mode an external annunciator to indicate when message is active and when way point sequencing is about to occur will also be installed in some installations the aircraft will have nav switch to select which navigation source is displayed on the primary hsi or cdi nav page has been specifically designed to provide most of the functions needed for non approaches this page pro vide an interface that presents pertinent navigation information way to access the flight plan and graphic presentation of the pre sent position relative to the flight plan way points you will find this page to be good friend while performing gps based non approaches approaches and sid and sid there are some approach procedures in the world that are not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base therefore it is not possible to use the kln for these approaches it is good pre flight practice ensure that the kln contains anticipated procedures for the flight addition to the two course modes and obs described in sec there are also two approach modes these are approach arm and approach active the status of the approach mode is indi cat ed on an external switch in most installations the external annunciator will indicate arm for the approach arm mode and approach active will be annunciated by act the main differ ence of these modes from the normal en route mode is that the integrity monitoring is set to tighter level another difference between these modes and the en route mode is that the cdi scale factor will usually change to nm for arm and will always change to nm when in the apr act mode the arm mode can be selected in two ways the normal way is that this mode will be selected automatically by the kln when the aircraft is within nm of an airport and an approach is loaded in the flight plan for that airport it is possible to arm the approach mode at distance greater than nm from the airport by pressing the exter al gps approach switch but the kln will not change the cdi scale factor until the aircraft reaches the nm point if the gps apr external switch is pressed while the approach mode is armed then the kln will disarm the approach and change back to en route mode the cdi scale factor will also change back to nm the approach can be re by simply pressing the gps apr switch again the apr act mode can only be engaged automatically by the kln to cancel the apr act mode press the external gps apr switch this will change the mode to apr arm once past the fa it is not possible to return to the approach active mode without con missed approach and flying back to the fa procedure for non approaches non approaches will all have the general flow of events as follows refer to figure and load the approach into the flight plan can bed one at almost any time but must be completed before reaching the final approach fix and should be done as soon as possible kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid corresponds to point in figure if the aircraft is greater than nm from the airport then the cdi scale factor will remain at the default nm full scale deflection to the approach arm mode this will occur auto when the aircraft is within nm of the airport and there is an approach loaded into the flight plan in fig ure the cdi scale factor will change to nm over the next seconds and the external annunciator will indicate arm established

will be required if the conditions do not change before reaching the fa if all of these conditions are met then the cdi scale factor will start to change to nm and the external annunciator will indicate act the fa in figure the cdi scale factor will be at nm and will remain at this scale factor until you manually cancel the approach mode by either pressing the external gps apr button to change to the arm mode by initiating direct to operation or by changing to obs mode it is not approved to conduct the final portion of the approach unless the kln is in the approach active mode on external annunciator to the missed approach point in figure the kln will not automatically sequence to the next way point must manually change to the appropriate way point accord ing to the situation by default the kln will nominate the first way point of the published missed approach procedure when is pressed and the active way point is the map and you have flown past the map number in section necessary conduct the missed approach procedure remember to always refer to the paper chart when conducting missed approach the obs mode is usually needed at some point during missed approach and is always required to fly the holding pattern in figure details of the above operations as well as several examples of how to conduct non approaches using the kln are given in the following sections and sid and sid selecting an approach the first item in the list from the previous section is to select and load the approach into the active flight plan approaches are selected from the apt act page of the airport for which you desire to shoot the approach if you are operating from flight plan the easi est way to get to the approach information is by turning to the act page for your destination as described in section following example will use the vor or gps rwy approach to los angeles international airport select and load an approach into the active flight plan to one of the apt pages and select lax by using the cursor inner and outer knobs the right inner knob to turn to the apt page if you select ed lax from the apt page turn the inner knob one click counter to reach the apt page the cursor on by pressing the cursor comes up on the first approach in the list of approaches use the right outer knob to move the cursor to different approaches if there are more than approaches to an airport you can move the cur sor down to the other procedures into view by rotating the right outer knob the flashing cursor over vor kln will present list of initial approach fixes corresponding to this approach in this example we want the elmo iaf select this by pressing when the cursor is over elmo note if there is only one iaf for procedure then the kln will skip this step and go on to the

sid and sid many cases atc will not tell you explicitly which iaf to use in these cases you need to select an iaf which is closest to the route of flight that you expect if you expect radar vectors then the selection of the correct iaf is less important because you will be given vectors to the fa and will not need to use the iaf kln next presents list of way points that make up the approach review these way points to make sure that you have selected the correct iaf if there are more than four way points in the approach you can move the cursor up to other way points into view by rotating the right outer knob the cursor over add of pl and press kln will then bring up the pl page and put the sequence of approach way points in front of the airport reference point any time during the process of selecting an approach you can easily return to the previous step by pressing the button way points that make up the approach procedure are loaded into the flight plan at the top of the list of approach way points is that describes the approach that follows an example of this is shown on line of figure which indicates that the vor approach for los angeles international airport is in the active flight plan the approach has been entered into the flight plan the kln to make sure that the resulting flight plan sense if the kln detects any way points that are in both the en route por tion

can only be entered into pl the active flight plan if the kln is turned off for more than minutes then the approach is deleted when power is turned back on interpreting what you see in the example above you may have noticed couple of way point swith somewhat strange names the second way point of the approach procedure lax has name that is not normal for way point this is an example of what are called way points these are way points that are associated with specific airport they are used to define spot on the ground that does not have normal way point name in the case of this point is nm from the lax vor on the the fifth way point in the approach pro ced ure ma is another type of terminal way point in this case this point is the missed approach point for runway this approach applies to both the left and right runways so the letter is used to mean are few other types of terminal way points that you will need tobe familiar with to fully understand gps non approaches the naming convention for these way points are as follows stands for final approach fi xix yy stands for intermediate fix yy stands for course fix mx yy stands for missed approach point rw zzz rw stands for runway fix this is usually the map for the approach zzz will be runway number possibly including for left for right for center or for both stands for dme arc way point aaa is the radial that the fix is on from the reference vor will be letter corresponding to the distance from the reference vor for example is the seventh letter of the alphabet so would be point on the nm from the reference vor dme arcs greater than nm will have way points where the first two characters are the first two letters of the dme identifier the next three characters will be the radial that the arc way point is on the rules above and yy are defined as follows for runways with only one approach will be replaced with an or for run ways that have multiple approaches will be replaced with for vor for ndb or for rna the letters yy will be replaced with either the runway identifier ff or for circling approaches the inbound course to the missed approach point ma along given radial will be named such that the first three letters are the reference vor and the next two are the dme distance if the distance is greater than nm the order is reversed for example lax is nm from lax while is nm from fl the aircraft is not too far from the destination airport the nav can be used to determine where some of these way points are relative to others in the approach at the time of this writing all of the nos charts and some eppes en charts do not show the special ter mina way points that are required for gps approaches for this reason it is good idea to understand what the special way points are used for and what they mean may have also noticed that some way points have small letter at the end of the way point name the small letter is an aid that we have added to the name of some way points to help you recognize important points in the approach these suffixes are displayed on many of the kln pages the definitions of these suffixes are the initial approach fix of the approach the final approach fix of the approach the missed approach point of the approach the missed approach holding point for the approach every approach will have fa and map almost all will have an iaf and missed approach holding point another item that you should notice in the flight plan is the line that has seq on it this is what is referred to as fence and the purpose of this line is to tell you that approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid kln will not automatically sequence past the way point that precedes the fence the way point before the fence is always the missed approach point the reason that way point sequencing is not allowed is that many missed approach procedures require specific actions before going to the missed approach holding point climbing on fixed heading until reaching an altitude changing or deleting an approach once loaded into the flight plan the sequence of way points that are retrieved from the data base of the kln define the approach procedures as they are charted to ensure that the proper path over the ground is followed it is not possible to either delete or add way points to the approach section of the flight plan to help you see which way points are en route way points and which are approach way points the kln does not display colon next to the way point number on the pl page if the way point is an approach way point it is only possible to replace the existing approach with another one delete the entire approach from the flight plan replace an existing approach or delete an approach the left page displaying the active flight plan turn the cursor on by pressing the cursor so that it covers the approach header at the top of the approach procedure once the cursor comes over the approach header it will automatically change to read change ppr if you press in this condition the kln bring up the apt page that corresponds to the current approach at this point it is poss ble to select different approach procedures different iaf or both you press the button while the cursor is over the approach header it will change to read delete ppr if you press now the kln vor ndb int usr act nav

plan if the kln was in the approach arm or the approach active mode then deleting the approach will cause the kln to change back to en route mode this means that the cdi scale factor will change back to the default nm scale example approach no procedure turn now that you know the basics of inserting an approach into the flight plan we can now show the approach operation of the unit by several examples this first example will use the approach that was loaded into the flight plan in section this example will show how the kln sequences through an approach and what type of an nunci ation and scale factor changes can be expected the kln will remain in the familiar leg mode so there will be no need to change between leg and obs mode in this example refer to the approach plate for this approach to see what the procedure looks like this example it is assumed that you are on an active flight plan with the final destination being the los angeles international airport lax it is also assumed that atc will not give you radar vectors during this approach the vor approach to lax as demonstrated in sec tion you are within nm of the airport the kln will auto mat ically arm the approach mode and provide the following message alt to set baro the message acts as reminder to make sure the kln is using the correct barometric pressure if the barometric information is not correct then the integrity monitoring provided by the kln will not be as good as it could be press to bring up the alt page and verify that the barometric pressure is correct if the kln is interfaced with compatible air data com that provides the correct barometric pressure to the kln then the previous message is not displayed and it is not necessary to update the barometric pressure this time the kln will smoothly change the cdi scale factor to nm the external approach annunciator installed in the aircraft will indicate that the approach is in the arm mode kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid you approach elmo the kln will provide way point alerting on the external annunciator as well as on the screen of the kln once you pass elmo the kln will auto mat ically sequence to the next way point in the approach lax approaches and sid and sid may be good time to select the nav page this page is especially useful for getting feeling of where you are in the approach the aircraft approaches the lax way point the kln will again provide way point alerting as the aircraft passes lax and sequences to fit on the kln will provide message telling you to set the external indicator or hsi to new value if desired track is shown on the screen this value will flash when the external selected course does not match the tk within the aircraft approaches the fa it is good idea to check over the status of the kln look at the kln screen to verify that leg sequencing is selected remember the kln will not transition to the approach active mode if the obs mode is selected if the kln shares an hsi or cdi with other nav sources it is also good to verify that the nav switch is set to gps the time the aircraft is nm from re by the final approach fix the kln will make prediction to see if integrity will be available at the fa and at the map if the pre diction indicates that integrity monitoring will be available and aim is currently available the kln will change the gps apr annunciator to read act at this time the kln will also start to change the cdi scale factor by the time the aircraft reaches the fa the cdi scale factor will be down to nm fix noel is not included in the list of way points provided in the data base you will need to identify this point by using the along track distances given in the profile view of the approach plate in this example noel is located nm from the map when the distance to ma is nm then the aircraft is at noel and you can descend to the md for this approach approach procedures require that you add up several along distances to be able to identify step down fix vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid kln will again provide way point alerting as you approach ma this is shown on the nav page by flashing active way point identifier following steps would need to be performed if missed approach is required reaching ma and not seeing the runway you decide to perform missed approach remember the kln will not automatically sequence past the missed approach point this is shown on the nav page by not showing any lines connecting way points that are past the map to perform the published missed approach procedure press to bring up the direct page the default way point will be the first way point of the missed approach procedure in this case the first way point is lax confirm this way point as the direct to way point and press reaching lax the kln will sequence to the next way point in the missed approach procedure in ish in this example there is no holding pattern published for the missed approach so you can expect further instructions upon reaching in ish atc gives you instructions for missed approach that is different from the published missed approach procedure it is always possible for you to select different direct to way point than the default direct to way point vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th example approach off navaid an approach that is quite common is an approach that is based off fan off navaid an example of this is the vor rwy approach to clovis new mexico municipal airport kc vn to fly this procedure as published use the following steps and refer to figure for the procedure for this example assume that the aircraft is approaches and sid and sid approaching from the northeast going direct the clovis airport with no active flight plan the approach into the flight plan as described in section in this case there is only one iaf so the kln does not present the option for you to select an iaf in this example there is no active flight plan to begin with so the kln will ask to add the approach to pl the area atc tells you to go direct the tx vor and clears you for the approach to kc vn this is easy to do from the nav page by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning through the active flight plan by turning the inner knob once tx is displayed in the scanning window press and then to initiate direct to operation to the tx vor distance of nm to the tx vor the kln will give the following message required select obs this message provides reminder that to fly course reversal the obs mode needs to be selected note from the approach chart that there is opt arrival sector for this approach if you are approach ing tx within the indicated area there is no need to perform course reversal and you need to ignore this message the opt sector is not stored in the data base so it is not possible for the kln to know if course reversal is required or not as result the kln will always give this message whenever way point could be used for course reversal the kln will properly sequence to the fa to map leg and transition to the approach mode when nm from the iaf however you are approaching from any other direction course reversal is required and the obs mode will need to be selected if the obs mode is not selected before reaching tx then the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach point this is not desirable when performing course reversal so the obs mode must be selected before reaching tx the kln will only remind you to select obs mode if the iaf is the active way point therefore if course reversal is required make sure the iaf is the selected way point pilot guide approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and sid and sid course reversal is required then upon reaching tx perform the appropriate holding pattern entry and set the inbound course on the external cdi or hsi in this example the inbound course is at this point the kln works very similar to con vent ion al vor established on the inbound course of switch back to the leg mode when leg mode is selected the fa is automat cally made the active way point when the iaf and the fa are at the same way point is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the fa as the active way point before crossing the fa to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale factor the cdi scale fac tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the fa delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor change this will make the transition more abrupt if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active mode the aircraft is nm from the fa the kln will verify that the proper integrity is available if integrity monitoring is available for the approach then the kln will change to the approach active mode this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to nm reaching tx the kln will automatically sequence to rw the missed approach point fix at dme from tx along the final approach course is not included in the way points that come from the data base since the distance that the kln is giving you is distance to the map you will need to mentally figure out when the aircraft has reached this point is done by looking at the along track distances given in the plan view of the approach in this case the fix is nm from rw upon reaching this distance you can descend to the md for this approach missed approach is required for this approach then the following steps would be required published missed approach procedure for this approach is to make climbing left turn to feet and proceed direct to the tx vor in this case tx will be the default direct to way point kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid is pressed this is the desired way point so press to confirm the way point and proceed direct to the vor if atc gives you instructions for missed approach that are different from the published missed approach procedure it is always possible for you to select different direct to way point than the default direct to way point the aircraft approaches tx you will need to select obs mode to stop way point sequencing and define the inbound course for the holding pattern if you do not select the obs mode before the aircraft is within nm of the holding point then the kln presents message reminding you to select the obs mode note another attempt at the approach is desired after holding itis necessary to manually change the active way point when the fa and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active way point to the fa when you change from obs to leg make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active mode example approach radar vectors for this example we will use the same approach that was used in the previous section except this approach will be conducted with the help of radar vectors from approach control the aircraft will be assumed to be arriving from the west although this does not change the way the approach will be flown using the kln approach has been selected and entered into the flight plan and the aircraft is going direct to kc vn new mexico municipal as described in section soon as atc mentions radar vectors you should immediately start to think of the obs mode once given radar vectors change the active way point to tx and select the obs mode note that it is not important what order these events take place it is just as effective to change to obs mode and then change the active way point as it is to change the active way point and then switch to obs mode change the selected course on the cdi or hsi to the final approach course for this exam ple the inbound course is is now possible to watch your progress on the nav page and anticipate when you will be given new headings to fly established on the inbound course you will need to change back to the leg mode to allow for proper approach operation and automatic leg sequencing for best performance the change back to leg mode should be made before the aircraft is nm from the fa it is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the fa as the active way point before crossing the fa to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale factor the cdi scale fac tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the fa delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor change this will make the transition more abrupt if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active mode rest of this approach would be flown using the same steps as presented in section and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln pilot guide approaches and sid

vor rwy approach to bowman airport in louisville kentucky the airport identifier for this airport is lou approaches and sid and sid this example assume that the aircraft is approaching lou from the nabb vor passing the nabb vor you are told to expect the vor approach at lou you load the approach using the procedure described in section the distance from the present position to the destination airport reaches nm the kln will automatically arm the approach mode the cdi scale factor will transition to nm and the kln will provide more sensitive integrity monitoring you also press to update the barometric information the aircraft is nm from the qm vor the kln will give message reminding you to select the obs mode the obs mode is required for the procedure turn after passing qm select the outbound course of the external cdi or hsi aircraft is now headed outbound for the procedure turn as soon practical you will need to change the active way point to ff the final approach fix this is done by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning until ff is displayed in the win dow then pressing then pressing the obs course will still be what is select ed on the external cdi or hsi the obs mode selected and ff as the active way point it is possible to fly the procedure turn allow enough distance past ff to complete the procedure turn and still be nm away before reaching the fa after completing the outbound portion of the procedure turn change the selected course to the inbound course of the external cdi or hsi established on the inbound course the leg mode will again need to be selected so that proper approach operation and way point sequencing will occur is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the fa as the active way point before crossing the fa to activate the

kln to change to the approach active mode the aircraft is nm from the fa the kln will verify that the proper gps integrity is available if integrity monitoring is available for the approach then the kln will change to the approach active mode this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to nm way point alerting will occur as the aircraft passes the final approach fix the leg from the final approach fix to the missed approach point will become active and the cdi scale factor will remain at nm if the auto scale factor was selected on the nav page then the scale factor will zoom in on the airport as the aircraft gets closer and closer to the missed approach point eventually the map scale changes to nm following steps are followed if missed approach is required missed approach instructions call for climbing left turn to heading of intercepting the course to the missed approach holding fix scum to fly this with the kln it will be necessary to put the kln into the obs mode and make scum the active way point change the selected course on the external cdi or hsi to the aircraft reaches scum you will need to perform holding pattern entry suitable for this holding pattern and set the selected course to the holding pattern example approach dme arc dme arc procedures with the kln are completely different from using traditional vor and dme equipment don worry though because dme arc procedures using the kln are also easier than using traditional equipment this is because the kln pro vide left guidance around the arc no more having to watch distance in one place and radial in another being vectored dme arc is really whole bunch of initial approach fixes placed one next to each other to form an arc very rarely do you actually fly to the beginning of an arc especially in radar environment instead the flight path of the aircraft generally intersects the arc at some point once the aircraft is near the arc it is then possible to turn so that the arc distance is maintained until time to turn to the inbound fix following example will show how dme arc procedures are flown using the kln this example approach will be to use the vor rwy approach to owatonna minnesota kow the approach plate for this approach is in figure assume that the aircraft is approaching from the north and is in radar environment assigns the vor rwy approach turn to the apt page for kow to select the approach you select the vor approach and the kln pre sents the iaf selection page are five choices for the iaf three of these choices you can recognize but the other two and are un amil ar and not shown on this chart these two way points are the data base identifiers for the ends of the arc means dme arc point is the radial on which the way point lies and indi cates the distance of the arc is the twelfth letter of the alphabet so the indicates that this is dme arc in similar manner can also be decoded in this example the aircraft is approaching from the north so the iaf will be selected kln knows that this point is associated with dme arc once an arc way point is chosen the kln determines what radial of the reference vor the aircraft is presently located on way point is created that is located at the intersection of the pre sent radial and the dme arc this way point is the first way point in the list of way points presented on the apt page before loading approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the approach into the flight plan this way point is

and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure caution the kln does not take into account the geom try of the active flight plan when determining the arc intercept point this point is defined solely on the present radial and the defined arc distance from the reference vor for this reason it is better to delay selecting approaches that contain dme arcs until the aircraft is closer to the destination the cursor over add to pl press the approach will be loaded into the active flight plan just like any other approach would be the approach is loaded into the flight plan the kln may give the message pts in pl edit en route pts as necessary this message is given because very often it will be necessary toed it the active flight plan to ensure that proper way point seq enc ing occurs examine the flight plan and if practical observe the nav page to make sure that the sequence of way points does not have any unnecessary legs in it kln will now provide guidance to the arc intercept point the nav page displays the entire arc on the screen the por tion that is between the beginning of the arc and the arc intercept is drawn with dashed line the part that is between the arc inter ept point and the end of the arc is drawn with the normal solid line some cases atc may provide radar vectors to the arc the kln provides means to define new intercept point based on the current track of the aircraft over the ground this can be done from either the nav page or from the pl page the dashed line displayed on the nav page will help you to deter mine if atc is giving you correct vectors the nav page pull out the right inner knob to bring up the way point scanning window the right inner knob until the first way point of the arc is displayed in this example for approaches this will have small appended to the way point name if the recalculation is to be done from the pl page then turn on the cursor and move it over the first way point of the arc and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure either page press this will change the way point to read move if it is desired to recompute the arc intercept point then press if new arc intercept

intercept the arc then the kln will display no in tcp tin the scratchpad area of the screen the aircraft approaches the arc the kln will provide way point alerting and turn anticipation to join the arc established on the arc the kln provides left guid ance relative to the curved arc distance to the active way point is the distance from the present position to the active way point not the distance along the arc refer to appendix for the geometry of the arc the arc the desired track will be constantly changing to help you keep the orientation correct the nav page will auto mat ically display tk on the fourth line it is not possible to change this to something else while on the arc the value dis played for the desired track will flash when the difference between the cdi or hsi and the current desired track is greater than dme arcs have defined radials that serve as step down fixes these points are not stored in the data base to help you determine your position relative to these step points along the arc the kln will display new value in the bottom right corner of the display on the nav page this new bit of inform tion is denoted by the letters arc followed by three numbers three numbers represent the current radial that you are on relative to the reference vor the arc radial is forced into this position when the aircraft is nm from the arc the arc display is shown in figure just watch this value and when it reads the same as one of the step points you can descend as necessary this particular example does not have such points but there are quite few approaches that do pilot guide approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and sid and sid performance may not be satisfactory if coupled in the nav mode while flying the arc

there will be problem with the integrity of the gps sy tem while you are conducting non approaches with the kln in some cases the kln will determine that there will not be sufficient integrity monitoring for the leg between the fa and the map or aim is not currently available in these cases the kln will not go into the approach active mode and will present the follow ing message not available apr mode inhibited predict aim on th these cases you will not be able to finish the approach because there is insufficient integrity monitoring the th page provides means for you to predict when aim will be available to perform aim prediction on the th page two pieces of in for ation are needed the first is the location that the prediction will be for and the second is the time for the prediction destination way point will by default be the missed approach point of an approach loaded in the flight plan if there is no approach in the flight plan then the default way point is the last way point in the active flight plan of course it is possible for you to enter any way point in this field time used for the aim prediction will be the current eta to the destination airport or the map this time is automatically updated by the kln so there is usually no need to enter value if you are making aim calculation for planning purposes it is also possible to enter time in this field an important point about this time is that the time used for aim prediction is always in the future and limited to hours from the present time for example if the time is now and the time entered for the eta is then the prediction will be made for the next day not one hour ago pilot guide approaches and sid and sid to perform manual aim calculation the left outer and inner knobs to select the th page

terminal arrival routes by sid name sid procedures stored in the data base can only be considered accurate as long as the data base is current even though the data base contains sid and star procedures there is lot of information that is not included in the data base therefore the paper chart is still the primary source of information for example many procedures require the aircraft to fly to certain altitude along heading until intercepting course and many other procedures that the kln can not automatically accomplish many procedures require pilot action to ensure that the proper path is flown over the ground the main purpose of loading sid or star into the active flight plan is to provide you with quick way of loading potentially large number of way points and star procedures can be as challenging to fly as some approaches are therefore it is mandatory that you are comfortable with the operation of the kln before attempting to fly sid and star procedures in particular flight plan operation and the obs mode should be second nature to you note are some sid procedures in the world that are not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base and therefore the way points that make up these procedures would have to be entered manually it is good preflight practice ensure that the kln con tains anticipated procedures for the flight and star procedures are stored with the airport for which they apply sid and star procedures are accessed through the apt page if there are both sid and stars for given airport then there will be two apt pages one to select sid and the other to select star this is indicated by apt it is also possible to have only sid or only star in which case there is only one apt page pilot guide approaches and sid and sid sid and star procedures are defined in three parts the parts are the sid or star name porte transition fellows and runway specific component rw the apt

difficult that you are likely to come across most procedures are not this difficult but this sid serves as good example for what steps to take when you encounter difficult procedure fly this procedure use the following steps and refer to the chart for this sid the sid as described in section procedure states and proceed via sfo the dme fix at or above to accomplish this por of the sid put the kln into the obs mode with sfo as the active way point and make selected course it is easiest to accomplish these steps before take sfo is the way point that is dme from the sfo vort ac and thein bound course to this fix after take climb to as required by the sid the aircraft reaches sfo turn left to heading of this point it is necessary to manually change the active way point to this is done easily from either the nav page or from the pl page in either case once porte is highlighted by the cursor press to bring up the direct top age to confirm porte as the direct to way point the selected course on the hsi or cdi to the new value of as required by the sid continue flying heading of the hsi or cdi needle centers and then fly to keep the needle centered and fly to porte and sid and sid kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid reaching porte change back to the leg mode to enable automatic way point sequencing once the aircraft reaches porte the kln will automatically sequence to the next way point esca passing esca the procedure calls for until intercepting the to wages intersection to do this with the kln change back to the obs mode and make sure that wages is the active way point set the selected course to reaching wages change to the leg mode this will allow automatic way point sequencing upon reaching wages is an altitude restriction marked with an on the chart the name of this point is means that the way point is nm from the fl vor make sure to meet any alti tude requirements upon reaching this way point the aircraft reaches fl proceed on with the rest of the flight plan as required example of star procedure to illustrate the use of the kln with star procedures the steps required to fly acton four arrival to dallas worth international will be shown in this section this procedure is considerably simpler than the sid example shown in section for this example assume that the aircraft departs from el paso texas and files for the acton four arrival with the wink transition use the fol lowing steps to fly this procedure with the kln and refer to the chart for this star the star into the flight plan as described in section star is very simple and the kln will automatically guide the aircraft along the proper route until the qn vor before reaching qn examine this procedure and notice that there are two different routes depending on what type of air craft is flying the star turbojets fly to creek intersection while non fly to rend intersection the data base in the kln has the sequence of way points for the turbojet procedure not the sequence for non is extremely rare to have different path over the ground for turbojets and non but be sure to cross check with your paper charts and sid and sid if the aircraft you are flying in is turbojet then fly the rest of the star as depicted on the chart with no changes to the flight plan if the aircraft is not turbojet then follow these steps to the pl page and delete the following way points mark um bry ar hulen flat and creek to do this turn on the cursor and rotate the right outer knob until the cursor is over one of the above way points pilot guide approaches and sid and sid and then to delete

example is the same as is the same as conversions appendix appendix gps primer background the global positioning system is satellite navigation system that was originally conceived and implemented by the united states department of defense the system is however avail able to all civilian users free of charge gps provides extremely precise position velocity and time information satellites are not geosynchronous as is the case with many weather and television satellites that is each satellite is not above fixed spot on the earth all the time but rather is continuously moving across the sky in fact each satellite completely orbits the earth two times per day department of defense imposes an intentional accuracy de gra of the gps system this degradation is known as selective availability when sa is active only military users have access to full gps accuracy for civilian users position accuracy is degraded to no worse than meters at the time of this writing selective availability is on therefore accuracy is degraded near ly of the time position determining concept the technique used to determine position is fundamentally very sim the complicated part is accounting for and correcting all the possible errors in the position gps receiver is able to determine the time it takes radio signal to travel from the satellite to the gps antenna since this radio signal travels at the speed of light statute miles per second the time delay can very easily be used to determine the receiver distance from given satellite if measurements are taken from four satellites three satellites and an input from an aircraft altimeter the receiver can identify its position very precisely pilot guide appendix primer appendix for example the gps receiver might determine that it is exactly miles from satellite miles from satellite and miles from satellite at the same time the aircraft en cod altimeter might be indicating an altitude of feet msl there is only one point in space that satisfies these four measurements data signals two of the primary types of signals that the gps satellites broadcast are almanac and ephemeris data these signals enable the gps receiver to quickly lock on to the satellites in view otherwise the receiver would have to look for each of the satellites to determine which ones could be used data is very crude data which describes the approximate orbital position of the satellites each of the satellites transmits the almanac data for all satellites so gps receiver has only to listen to one satellite in order to know which satellites are the sky at that particular time almanac data is good for about six months so when you turn the receiver off then back on month later it will know what satellites to look for data is very precise data which each satellite transmits to tell the gps receiver exactly where it is and what its orbital para me ter will be for about the next four hours each satellite transmits its own unique ephemeris data ff primer appendix nm nm nm ft msl not to calen gps system segments the gps system is composed of three segments the space segment the control segment and the user segment space segment consists of the nav star satellites which orbit the earth at an altitude of nautical miles the satellite orbits are very precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the gps system hours day every day there are almost always more than six satellites in view from anywhere on earth control segment consists of network of ground monitor and control stations the master control station is located in colorado springs colorado all satellite data which is collected by the other ground stations is assimilated and analyzed at colorado springs based on these analyses ephemeris updates as sy tem clock corrections are sent to the satellites through radio transmitters at the ground stations these ground stations are located at kwajalein of hawaii in the central pacific ocean diego garcia the indian ocean and ascension the south atlantic ocean an owner of gps system you can now claim to be certified member of the gps user segment gps has many users and uses and more are being dreamed up all the time not only are aircraft using gps navigation so are military systems and personnel boaters hikers and surveyors personal automobiles and transport trucks use intelligent transportation systems or its to find their destinations and track their movements some biologists attach gps receivers to animals to monitor their movement and migration patterns geologists even use gps to track the movement of lac ers and to analyze plate tectonics of the earth crust an exciting new technology as we move into the century autonomous integrity monitoring is function that every ifr gps receiver must continuously perform to assure an accurate position one characteristic of the gps space and control segments is that they can instantly fix satellite if it begins sending misleading positioning information for this reason gps receiver can rely on the gps satellites to tell it when there is pos error the words autonomous indicate that the gps kln pilot guide appendix primer appendix receiver on it own can detect an inaccuracy in the gps system it does this by using distance measurements from as many satellites as possible to check the consistency of the position is called an over position solution there are not enough satellites in view to assure the position in te gri the kln notifies the pilot five measurements with good geometry positions of the satellites are needed to provide aim this means that at least five satellites or four satellites and pressure altitude input from the aircraft altimeter are required to assure aim availability likewise if this check shows some in con sistency in the position the kln notifies the user that other navigation sources should be used to cross the position additionally sometimes the receiver is unable to assure the position to enough accuracy for the phase of flight due to the location of the satellites at that instant availability is very seldom difficulty when in the en route and terminal phases of navigation the allowable limits are much tighter when non approach is performed with kln for this reason the kln other page allows the pilot to enter time and location and the gps receiver will predict if aim will be available to shoot the non approach see section for more information about the aim prediction capability press receiver the kln and kln use an honeywell gps receiver known as the gps press it was dubbed this way because it is ident cal in size to an everyday credit card and its faster acquisition time than previous single designs the gps receiver has eight parallel channels which means each channel can continuously track satellite for continuous tracking of up to eight gps satellites the parallel receiver design has several advantages performance during high dynamic conditions and

qualification training and checking as well as for the relevant portion of conversion training and checking the course was verified to fulfill the requirements of jar amc in an acceptable way this type rating training course is an intense and demanding course additional training should be considered for pilots without any previous experience with efis and fms the safe operation of the airplane is predicated upon the awareness at all times and of both pilots of the airplane flight modes and flight parameters strict adherence to crew coordination procedures in normal as well as in abnormal situations is essential and should be regarded as mandatory these ccp specific to aircraft type and to operator should be fully integrated in the training the training organization therefore should be made aware of the specific crew coordination procedures as established by the operator before training is started pilots having no relevant experience with the app li cation of crew coordination proc dures will benefit from bridge course on this topic pilots having no relevant experience with the operation of an integrated avionics flight management system and flight guidance system like the collins pr suite will benefit from bridge on this topic these specific additional courses should ideally be completed before the full flight simulator training phase emergency procedures are an essential part of the training curriculum to avoid confusion during training as well as during actual operations the training organization and the candidate pilots need to be made aware of the items to be performed without immediate reference to the checklist these steps should be defined before training is started preferably by the operator as part of its standard operating procedures further areas of special emphasis are covered in separate paragraph eas recommends to include line flying under supervision in the conversion training program and to follow the requirements of eu including

previous efis or fms experience establishing ear ly confidence in manually flying the aircraft converting from manual to automatic controlled flight mode and back is equally important due to heavy reliance on the automatic flight control system in the event of flight path deviation due to input error or system malfunction the flight crew must be able to comfortably transition from automatic to manual mode and back in an orderly fashion european aviation safety agency aviation authorities joint operational evaluation board gulf stream issue september recurrent training recurrent training and currency serve to maintain pilot continued competency for the operational tasks to be performed during proficiency checks this competency is established it is every operator responsibility to establish recurrent training and proficiency checking program approved by the national authority which is relevant to the type of airplane and the intended operation the requirements for recurrent training program may vary with several factors which have significant influence some of these factors are actu al exposure of the flight crew member specific routes and aerodromes used by the operator and new developments in technology these factors and combination thereof will determine how much recurrent training will actually be required it is recommended to follow the requirements of eu subpart

the problem brief overview of how the project research and analysis were conducted and list of the significant findings and recommendations readers and front line managers who may need or want more details of the problem research and analysis and complete listing of findings and recommendations can refer to the full report that follows the go noncompliance problem approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for aviation accidents accounting annually for approximately percent of all accidents flight safety foundation study of years of runway excursions determined that percent could have been avoided with decision to go around in other words percent of all accidents could potentially be prevented by going around it is generally felt that an unstable approach is the primary cause of landing excursions however within this period just over half of the landing excur followed fully stable approach in these instances the flight became unstable only during landing critical industry policy designed to help prevent such accidents is the go policy interestingly and sadly the collective industry performance of complying with go policies is extremely poor approximately percent of unstable approaches result in go policy compliance why is critical policy designed to prevent the most common type of accident ignored by flight crews and why is that policy not being managed effectively by management improving the go compliance rate holds tremendous potential in re approach and landing accidents the go itself is not without risk there is an increased risk in loss of control events during go compared to exposure with all other phases of flight it follows that we should only go around when the risk associated with an unstable approach is greater than the risk associated with go what is that balance and how do we minimize go exposure to only those that are really necessary the flight safety foun go decision making and execution project was launched to research and answer the question are we so poor at complying with established go policies it was also intended to improve our understanding of the risks associated with executing go and to make re com to improve compliance and mitigate risks assoc with the go maneuver itself the full report includes complete research analysis find strategies and recommendations for industry corrective action and future work required as such it is meant as source for the development of easier operator refer products such as guidelines and checklists research and analysis many alas have been investigated thoroughly over time and much is known about contributing factors what is lacking however is an understanding of the psychology of noncom pli research and analysis of go decision making have been conducted primarily from the psychosocial science perspective to gain an understanding of the psychological drivers of noncompliance and to identify corrective steps that can be taken based on science this is the first industry anal of its type for this specific problem the presage group conducted the research and analysis based on its situational model of nine distinct constructs or attributes from two global studies via web surveys one survey analyzed the psychology of noncompliance by flight crew members and the other examined the psychology of management actions in handling company go policies detailed analysis can be found in the full report for the go execution research an accident and incident review was conducted that included non selection of published accident and serious incident re about go events involving transport category aircraft between and total of go events were included in some the safety of the go was central to the accident or incident investigation in th the aftermath of the go was the main purpose of the investigation the events involved single jets percent twin turboprops percent and twin jets percent the context safety aspects and overall level of risk of each event were analyzed and characterized by review team each event was assigned to one of three categories according to the degree of risk presented by the go high risk events moderate risk events and non events in the two risk categories six go safety issues were identified with respect to the init ia and conduct of each go most of the risk bearing events were associated with single gas but five events were associated with two gas is each risk event also was assigned one of three risks loss of control flight controlled flight into terrain or midair collision significant findings an effective policy has three main attributes it is well thought out and clearly written to balance the needs of safety and accomplishment company management handles the policy consistently and company front line employees aware is such that the policy is carried out reliably research revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the industry operator and employee levels high significant findings are the collective industry norm is to accept the noncom pli of go polices despite empirical data that indicate this is the most common contributor to alas the industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable approaches as the sole means to reduce alas even though empirical data show that unstable approaches affect less than half of runway excursions pilots overall awareness of ala risks and of the impact those risks have on approach and landing safety is low management is generally disengaged from go noncompliance and has low awareness of the impact it has on alas management perception of risk is low pilots do not see current go policy criteria as realistic for the operational environment effective go decision making in flight deck com muni cation is low go although considered normal flight man eu are rare as reported by flight crews one in go has potentially hazardous outcome such as an aircraft per for exceed ance there are variable go techniques and challenges depending on the point during the approach when the go around begins procedures and training do not adequately address many of these challenges pilot experience in the aircraft type affects go proficiency go complexity including complex controller radio transmissions can affect go proficiency recommendations it is evident that the state of noncompliance has been steady for many years and will remain steady unless changes are made first and foremost the industry must improve its awareness of the problem shift in focus and cultural norms is required it is believed that significant improvement is attainable however the cultural shift will be easier if the industry shifts collectively as opposed to individual comp attacking the issue on their own as several are already doing as stated above three key attributes of an effective policy are the policy makes operational sense to both the employees who execute it and those who manage it the policy is managed effectively to level that satisfies company objectives and the employees who should follow the policy are very aware of that policy and the environment in which it is applied as such the following recommendations touch upon these key attributes more detailed recommendations can be found in the full report high strategic recommendations for go decision making include the following ensure the policy makes sense operationally update the stable approach definition and stable ap height to maximize their relevance among flight crews and their manageability among management separate the stable approach definition and criteria from decision criteria to improve aware that these are two distinct aspects of go policies and that decision making is viable beyond the defined approach phase this separation does not imply that these two distinct areas cannot meet at points throughout the approach and landing rather it is intended for developers of standard operating pro ce dures and communication procedures to break the psychological attachment of these two aspects manage the policy effectively operators set specific compliance rate targets performance indicators and establish initiatives to achieve them amend industry and regulatory audit programs to include standards and recommended practices that address go noncompliance increase situational awareness increase awareness of gan and risks associated with continuing to land when unstable and the significant impact that noncompliance has on alas among operator management ii flight crews iii industry and pilot associations regulators and manufacturers enhance situational awareness aware to heighten flight crews awareness throughout the approach and landing through policy and procedural enhancements communication improvements and iii minimizing the subjectivity of go decision making for the decision maker the pilot flying or captain to mitigate those components of situ awareness that compromise the pilot risk assessment and decision ability each recommendation helps improve the psychological riv that affect good decision making and it is this obj ec that the recommendations were specifically designed to address although all strategic recommendations are important and should be implemented as part of holistic approach few are worth highlighting first if an operator has the means to install automated stable approach and land alerting systems it should be priority these systems address many of the psychological issues associated with noncompliance and could be the single most effective way to improve go decisions second management must be more involved in managing the policy an area where management has been very much absent key steps to be taken by management are to set go compliance rate targets consistent with safety management system prin and to investigate and follow up on each approach that continues to an unstable landing finally flight crew situational awareness needs to be improved primarily through better communication throughout the approach and landing which can be achieved largely through active communication techniques as part of standard opera procedures high strategic go execution recommendations ensure that go training and awareness appro pri reflect different go execution risk scenarios review go policy procedures and ocu men to maximize their effectiveness clarity and understanding ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitoring during approach landing and go as with any significant program change desired and undesired effects should be closely monitored by appro pri audit programs such as flight data analysis line operations safety audits or international air trans association operational safety audits action taken in light of the findings and recommendations it is appar that revisions are required to flight safety foundation elements of stabilized approach and safe landing guidelines analysis indicates there are facets of that guidance that are not optimal for effective decision making and that may encourage go for approaches that may be of very low risk when this report was being published the analysis for such revisions had already taken place but the project review committee recommended an operational trial before changes in the foundation guidelines are formally adopted appendices and for flight safety foun stabilized approach and go guidelines for industry validation and safe landing guidelines for industry validation project conclusion report the problem of go policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the greatest threat to flight safety today and the po impact of improvement in compliance is significant no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go around the industry must improve its awareness of the problem to accomplish that shift in focus and cultural norms is required it is believed that significant improvement is attain however the cultural shift will be much easier if the in shifts collectively as opposed to individual companies taking individual action however several companies already have chosen to go it alone on this issue the project accomplished the goals of the document that outlined the terms of flight safety foundation go safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight crew members and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight managers and to consider the safety risk assoc with go and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of the report not all envisioned products have been completed however and this is noted in the report as work yet to be done by flight safety foundation background curtis william ia meeting boeing seattle presentation in flight safety foundation international advisory committee was briefed about concerns that go around often were not being conducted when an unstable approach occurred below the stable approach height the ensuing discussion concluded in agreement that the issue should be studied further interestingly the foundation eu advisory committee began its own discussion related to go the lack of unstable approach policy compliance the risk of the go maneuver itself and what effect air traffic services providers could have on the issue these discussions led the foundation to look more deeply into the empirical data supporting such concerns failure to conduct go is the number one risk factor in approach and landing accidents and the number one cause of runway excursions the year in review recent analyses of data from through indicate that percent of all accidents are runway excursions and that they are the most common type of accident the year in review unstable approaches occur on to percent of all approaches and to percent of flight crews whose airplanes are in this state continue the approach to landing the year in review evidence based training in of approach and landing accidents and serious incidents one of several studies conducted by flight safety foundation approach and landing accident reduction task force and published by the foundation in the task force con an in analysis of accidents and incidents that occurred from through the task force found that go was initiated in only percent of the occurrences and said that the evidence analysts expected the initiation of higher number of go in practice safety foundation alar task force approximately percent of all accidents are alas curtis one analysis concluded that more than percent of alas would have been preventable if the crew had decided to go around the year in review simply calculated potentially about half of all accidents could be prevented with decision to go around no other single de can have such an impact on the overall aviation accident rate although all of these studies are somewhat subjective the consistencies from study to study indicate the problem is real and is of the magnitude the studies indicate clearly go around decision can yield great benefits but what about the risks associated with the go maneuver itself there is no shortage of informative studies that have ana what occurred during alas and what factors contrib to the accidents however no known study has examined flight crew decision making from psychological perspective to determine why some crews continued with an unstable approach knowingly violating company policies and why th elected to go around what are the drivers of intentional noncompliance with critical safety policy the alar task force analysis of approach and landing accidents and serious incidents identified professional judgment decision making as the most re casual factor occurring in percent of the events another form of poor decision making or continuing an approach when conditions suggest otherwise accounted for percent of all occurrences safety foundation alar task force more questions arise about the actions or inactions of company management in these events if the data have been consistent for many years why have managers not been able to correct the problem with such low industry compliance rate some basic questions about management role need to be answered are they aware of the noncompliance rates and if so then why have they been unable to mitigate or improve compliance with established go policies if they are not concerned with the poor compliance rate why not man issues were not cited in any of the conclusions of the alar task force final of fatal approach and landing accidents however in the task force conclusions of related study of approach and landing ac and serious incidents management fail was identified as circumstantial factor in percent of the occurrences safety foundation alar task force based on these analyses better awareness of the problem and new questions flight safety foundation initiated the go decision and execution project it was designed as joint ea project with each committee focusing on one specific aspect of the issue the ia focused on go decision making and the ea focused on the performance of the go go decision making flight crew methodology and information collection the presage group was commissioned by flight safety foun to conduct research and analysis on the psychology of factors contributing to intentional noncompliance the basis for much of the following comes from two studies conducted by presage one that analyzed the psychology of flight crew decision making during unstable approaches and another that analyzed the psychology of company management decision making pertaining to addressing noncompliance with com go safety policies jamieson and curtis why are go policies ineffective the syc ology of de making during unstable approaches jamieson and curtis why are go policies ineffective the view from the airline manager desk although the issue extends beyond unstable approaches the studies were conducted on this phase of flight as data were readily attainable from flight crews psychological survey was developed that used unique questioning and experimental methodologies to understand the causation of compliant versus noncompliant flight crew go decision making these techniques included assess pilots experiences using series of questions designed to explore the psychological precursors of risk assessment and decision making second survey was designed to assess the perceptions beliefs and experiences of airline man ag and safety and operational personnel regarding unstable approaches and how they are managed at their host comp to fully understand the systemic roots and dynamics of noncompliance with unstable approach policies across the industry the results of the managers study were compared with those of the parallel flight crew study flight crew event recall study segmentation in this segment of the study we asked pilots to recall recent specific instances of unstable approaches at or below sah we asked for the last instance they had experienced this special recall task elicited detailed descriptions of their experiences during the minutes leading up to and including decision on whether to call for go these experiences include subjective aspects their situational and risk assessments felt social pressures

operationally compliant decision making pilot go thresholds study segmentation second experiment was included in this survey and we report some findings below but the details are too nu mer to fully describe here this experiment was designed to uncover the environmental and physical instability param that influence pilots perceptions of the risks inherent in flying unstable approaches and to examine when their attention to these parameters affects their judgments about when to call for go in this study pilots were pre with hypothetical flight scenario in which they were randomly assigned to receive variations in the severity of the risk associated with wind conditions runway conditions braking action and runway length they were then asked at what degree of deviation on five different flight parameters those variations would cause them to call for go pilots were instructed to report on their likelihood of calling for go based on their own personal risk criteria not those of their companies or of the industry on this set of five flight parameters and to do so at different altitudes this allowed us to infer where on the flight path different risk factors become personally salient and important as drivers of pilots judgments to go around and how these factors might interact the objective was to determine whether there was basic alignment between pilots perce about when there is need to call for go and general company policies about when these instabilities necessitate such decision in case of evidence of any gaps between these two our goal was to use these data to guide realistic recommendations about changes in policy that might bring them into alignment while ensuring that safety would not be compromised to the extent that pilots do not see current policies as constituting set of legitimately unsafe conditions they are likely to ignore such standard opera procedures and engage in potentially riskier noncom pli flight behaviors this was an experimentally based attempt to explore pilot perceptions of what should constitute the conditions to go around in their experienced judgment and to begin to develop view about whether such beliefs could be or should be incorporated into policy guidance and sops in way that would help ensure compliant safe behavior pilot respondent sampling respondents to this survey were solicited through direct communication with safety personnel at various pilot ass and fsf and non airlines globally as well as through various social media forums the goal was to invite and administer the online survey to as many pilots as possible from around the world representing variety of fleets aircraft flight operations respondent experience levels cultures physical geographies and so on anonym was assured to

policy as well as those responsible for day quality control of flight op series of questions regarding their views of the safety practices procedures and organizational cultures with which unstable approaches and go occur in their own airline operations specifically we asked such managers about the rates of compliance with unstable approach policies that they believed their airlines experienced as well as the compliance rates experienced by the commercial industry as whole beyond this basic knowledge we asked whether they were satisfied with their airline performance on comp li with their unstable approach policies and procedures and whether they thought them effective about their perceptions of the clarity and appropriateness of these policies and procedures about their beliefs that they had the support support and organizational approval to manage their company go rates and about their overall assessment of how urgently they believed that the risks any perceived in their go rates needed to be addressed at all the content of the entire survey was thoroughly reviewed commented upon and amended in ac with the recommendations made by members of the ia the ea and other expert

several caveats are explained below in fact the distributions by gender continent and language in the managers sample were nearly identical to those in the pilots sample while few directors completed the survey there were sizeable number of mid and senior managers in the sample however subsequent question about respondents roles and responsibilities within their airlines for re com and leading

development or implementation the considerable efforts that we made in our outreach and engagement strategy for the survey garnered unique visits to the survey portal we consider this number of hits to be very good indicating that the engagement strategy drove meaningful number of airline managers to the site however of those visiting only percent completed the survey response rate low in both absolute terms and relative to the rate of participation among pilots percent who were asked to complete much longer and more demanding survey this low response rate constitutes we believe the first evidence pointing toward disengagement with the topic of unstable approach policy and procedures among airline flight operations personnel at the managerial level this is especially true when we consider that the original criterion for inclusion in our final analysis stipulated that respondents must be in position to develop and influence unstable approach go policies and procedures at their airlines by virtue of their authority to recommend or make changes based on this inclusion criterion and an analysis of respondents self reported roles and responsibilities we achieved sample of only qualified re spon to increase the sample size for analysis we widened the sample frame to include those respondents responsible for quality control of day flight operations at their airlines even if they did not have policy development responsibilities thorough comparison of the latter group with the original target revealed no systematic differences in their survey responses justifying their inclusion in the final sample the study therefore reports the results from managers per of all survey respondents and percent of survey site visitors this low response rate essen disallowed us from analyzing data for second experimental task of determining personal go around thresholds for unstable approach risk among managers similar to the pilots go threshold experiment meanwhile in light of the low response rate caveat must be issued for all other results that we report below that is because the normative response to the survey invitation among managers worldwide was to choose not to participate therefore we must question whether this was valid and reliable sample of managers that said the results although based on this small sample are highly suggestive of trends in managers perspectives on unstable approach policies and procedures while we are unsure if the sample is in fact biased our intuition tells us that any sample bias if present would tend toward having surveyed managers who are more engaged aware and concerned about the issue than those who are less so if this is true these results may more likely over the degree of awareness and concern about unstable approach around noncompliance that exists in the industry industry sensing throughout the project there have been numerous dis with operators regulators manufacturers and bodies and conference and meeting present with follow conversations off accounts from agencies not wishing to be identified indicate that of those that have tracked go compliance rates are in the range of those discussed above

condition or unstable approach because they had recently experienced only that one type of event findings from comparison of these groups are conservative and represent situationally important factors associated with go decision making not pilot dispositional factors however pilot tendencies and preferences associated with flying unstable approaches are of course present in the aviation community and we will also point out in the data how such pilot di sposi factors may additionally contribute to noncompliance with go sops it is our belief that the best way to present the findings is to describe how pilots noncompliant behavior is function of decision process influenced by the in aircraft and environmental factors that shape pilots decisions their situational awareness competencies in encoding and inter the cues they receive about these aircraft and env factors their personal perceptions of risk and risk tolerance that result and their appetite for appropriate col conversation about risk during the approach as an input to decision making it is from both the pilots responses within each of these four classes of variables as well as the interactions between the two pilots that complete de scrip psychological profile for noncompliance emerges pilot situational awareness profile situational awareness of his or her environment in all its facets is the psychological prerequisite for pilot to judge risk and then to make decision to maintain compliance and safety in light of that judgment this study used the pre group situational awareness model for measuring and interpreting the psychological and social factors that col make up situational awareness recall that within this model situational awareness comprises nine distinct but interconnected and seamless aspects of awareness much of our discussion will be framed around how each of these aspects influences pilot decision processes singly and in concert with one another to remain compliant rather than noncompliant note in passing that the presage model classifies with an average percent accuracy whether pilots are describing an unstable approach and landing or go percent for unstable approaches and percent for go based only on its psychosocial measurements and excluding any knowledge of the objective factors present in the unstable approach scenarios reported this means that our assessment of the experience of aware as we have measured it does good job of predicting pilots decision behavior far beyond percent chance level of prediction the results of this study revealed as hypothesized that on all nine inter situational awareness factors unstable approach pilots were significantly less aware than go pilots in the moments leading up to and including their go around decision making that is they were less aware of their emotional responses to threat less able to anticipate risk more overconfident in their ability to compensate for the instability and in less agreement with company sops etc in other words the unstable approach pilots scored much lower than did the go pilots on every facet of situational awareness assessed seven of these nine differ held up statistically to the more rigorous analysis that compared just the experimentally assigned go and un approach pilots with one another and eight of the nine differences between the experimentally assigned go and unstable approach pilots were even more pronounced when comparing the ga and ua groups it is meaningful to ask does this awareness shape pilot perception of risk put simply pilot situational awareness competencies directly affect his or her perceptions and assessment of risk the lower the degree of threat that pilots associate with instability and environmental factors the perception of which is directly informed by their situ awareness the lower the significance that pilots will place on the contributing factors and the less risky they will perceive the situation to be table shows this result with unstable approach pilots reporting much lower assess of the riskiness and unmanageability of their inst bili than go pilots the spreading activation effect of situational awareness competencies we have asserted that the inter nature of the facets of situational awareness means that decline in one facet will produce rapid deleterious effect on the others this becomes clear when we consider the data relevant to this activation effect of situational awareness facets for example this cross effect is evident among the unstable approach pilot groups whose lower scores on their gut feel for threats as well as on actually seeing the threats leave them vulnerable to minimizing both their assessment of the potential threat of aircraft instability and their ability to see the threat of instability as risk to be managed correctly the natural outcome is that more unstable approach pilots are unstable at sah corollary of these lower aware scores is that unstable approach pilots also score lower in their ability to leverage crew relationships to maximize compliance and safety table shows that unstable approach pilots are more likely to minimize efforts to consider and discuss with their crew members both instability factors path deviation aircraft ref kt sink rate and land configuration and environmental factors turbulence contaminated runway and occupied runway it is the culminating effect of the aforementioned reduced awareness competencies that leaves the unstable approach pilots vulnerable to adopting mental model that minimizes the risk of instability and reduces their attention to details as the results for the instruments and equipment and the procedures indicate functional and hierarchical awareness in table unstable approach pilots are more tolerant of deviations from operational limits and procedures and less compliant with requirements that they perform all checklists and standard calls moreover as these pilots commit to continuing with an unstable approach they minimize what their professional experience could offer in executing what the sop states table note on experience or critical awareness in other words when an unstable approach pilot is not tuned into salient inform from his or her experience bank he increases the risk profile of the operation and denies himself the opportunity to correctly adjust or compensate for the operational threat table to threats or compensatory awareness the finding that unstable approach pilots more often than go pilots report being unstable at sah confirms this missed opportunity to remain compliant in concert with the former pattern is the finding that unstable approach pilots were more comfortable operating on the margins of the safety envelope example in table note the lower scores on the limits or task empirical awareness which translates to greater tolerance for risk that is seen to be manageable in table note the assessment of the instability as risky if pilot is paying less attention to his situational awareness competencies he would likely also shut himself off from avail resources such as by using interpersonal relationships to protect operational safety and remain compliant table note each other safe or relational awareness there are number of significant findings at the gran level of this construct that tell meaningful story most notable among these is that unstable approach pilots are relatively more likely than go pilots to feel crew pre to land to perceive lack of crew support for possible go decision to feel discomfort in being challenged and in challenging others and to feel inhibited about calling for go because of the authority structure in the cockpit also go pilots are about four times more likely than unstable approach pilots percent vs percent to report recalling that an individual was prompting the crew to initiate ref is reference landing speed go the evidence is clear that rather than leveraging the crew relationships as tool for safe decision making crew roles expectations and communication had suboptimal even deleterious effect finally compounding this risk profile are the findings that unstable approach pilots score lower on support for safety and that fewer than percent of unstable approach pilots believed they would be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to land while at the same time maintaining that their company criteria for when to execute go are not realistic in the end for the unstable approach pilots there is less buy to company sops and an incentive structure that or is at least not seen to discourage unstable approaches that are continued to landing these results describe situation that creates internal conflict for the unstable approach pilots at least in hindsight when they express regret for their decision to continue an unstable approach to landing specifically compared with go pilots unstable approach pilots rated their flight outcomes less positively believed less often that they had made the right decision believed much more strongly than go pilots that they should not have made the decisions they did and finally agreed more strongly that they had engaged in needless risk interpretation of results the results appear to imply conflicting message from the unstable approach pilot group on one hand unstable ap pilots regret their decisions to continue an unstable approach and land knowing that they have taken risk and yet at the same time they don believe that the company criteria for go are realistic the latter may be in part rationalization of their noncompliant decision and one that they carry forward into the next such unstable approach situation at the moment of decision the potential for noncompliant behavior based on these beliefs is very pre while the chance seems remote that pilots may anticipate post regret for not calling for go and may have that anticipation inhibit their tendency to continue the unstable approach consider the psychosocial factors affecting unstable ap pilots at the time they need to make an appropriate decision on whether to go around they have lowered sense of situational awareness across most facets which has led them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their assessment of risk further their decision process re little help from protective crew norms and processes and there is no real disincentive to fly unstable approaches the expected company response to that decision these are the ingredients of recipe for the of deviance to contaminate this component of aviation safety culture essentially this term refers to the development of normal mode of operation which is passively support tolerated and approved by its stakeholder owners management and in some cases regula once entrenched within given culture this new mode power and authority can considerably influence behavior as evidenced in the challenger and columbia space shuttle tragedies supportive evidence from the results of this study indicates that in their acceptance of the noncom normal unstable approach pilots have surrendered level of situational awareness competency that directly impacts accurate risk assessment and full compliance with sops as published in short new norms roles and incentives have come to displace some of the influence that situational awareness should have in proximity to risk assessment and decision making pilot thresholds for going around another area for discussion is the second experimental part of the survey which asked pilots to describe their risk toler thresholds for various in parameters given set of flight and environmental conditions we found that braking action vs poor had particularly large impact on pi perception of the degrees of instability that warrant call for go on the whole however pilots thresholds for calling for go varied as function of both height agl and the instability parameter they were considering as reason for going around for several of these instability fac the perceived threshold occurred well below ft agl to in particular pilots said that they should be on profile at roughly ft agl and that they could com pen for instabilities for ref and sink rate later in the decent at around ft agl in another project analysis combined data from six north american airlines international jet airlines three regional jet airlines and one regional turboprop airline that are studying this problem independently show pilot responses to the question is the lowest altitude you believe safe go could be executed from with

levels of unstable approach risk full analysis of the objective levels of risk in each event recalled by the pilots is warranted to fully explain the he of broad noncompliance with go policies and sops the inherent risks associated with the percent of unstable approaches that continue unstable can only be indirectly inferred from the present methodology based on pilot self this study mainly assessed the psycho logi characteristics and attributes in situ of pilots who choose to continue unstable approaches to landing versus those who make decisions to go around the study does not segregate the various unstable approach scenarios into classes of env presenting high or low objective risks while it is understood that not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent risk the percent of unstable approaches that are flown to completion include the highest ap and these can result in accidents in the absence of definition of the objective level of risk associated with given approach pilots have only one set of criteria one definition of the instabilities and environmental threats that are expected to trigger go choice beyond this single definition it is up to

this determination flows directly from his level and type of situational awareness and the mental models of risk he constructs based on that awareness to the extent that pilot has lowered situational awareness whether caused by acute aspects of the situation such as high workload or chronic aspects of the cultural environment such as lessened acceptance of the company go policy guidance or generally few challenges to cockpit command he will be less sensitive to relevant situational awareness cues and therefore be more likely to continue an unstable approach irrespective of the inherent objective risks associated with the approach these inadequately informed mental models of risk less accurately and sensitively represent the objective levels of the present threat as result they will not track re and will tend to produce an over of noncom decision making complete prescriptive policies vs predominately prescriptive policies complete prescriptive go policies and sops lend them to

landing distance available ref reference landing speed source the presage group for flight safety foundation and environmental threats that are expected to trigger go choice single set of criteria is often insufficient to cover all eventualities however as tony kern an aviator psychologist and author of several books on human behavior has said guidance is ef when it is thought out and fair written clearly explained thoroughly commonly understood and voluntarily complied with too many rules lead to cynicism and noncompliance and because not all situations can be anticipated rules cannot be developed to cover all possible developments in these cases the human ability to adapt to changing situations is just as important as the implementation of effective policies and procedures need to reach point where two types of professional discipline become second habits kern said first is the organizational discipline to keep the rules to an absolute minimum and enforce the rules across the board the second is the personal discipline to comply company policies too often he said policies and procedures conflict with cultural norms and when that happens who studies noncompliance knows that culture will nearly always trump policy at least in the long run not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent risk and based on the different objective environments from approach to approach there can be conflict between these and the singular prescriptive company go policy as in by the pilots disagreement with company go policy thresholds once pilot is outside the prescriptive box of go policy and has made the decision to continue the approach he is left to his individual risk assessment method whatever that may be to determine his personal risk thresh without guidance robust prescriptive policies that allow for some guided open analysis of risk and decision making can offer solution to these cases in which the objective env and stated policies do not align well for example if company go policy says that flight crew must go around in all cases if the aircraft has not touched down within seven seconds of crossing the threshold the pilots likely would view the importance of that policy dif depending on the conditions of the day they would likely be more in agreement with the policy for an approach to shorter runway that was contaminated and had slight tail wind than for an approach to longer dry runway with slight head wind if the policy is written to allow some devi from the seven requirement under some guiding principles pilots will agree with the policy more often in this example of the short contaminated runway the pre briefing should include statement that there would be no modification of the seven rule whereas in the case of the dry long runway the briefing may include an allowance to increase that time frame to seconds it is important to em that these allowances should follow guided process laid out by the company and that the policies remain pre do mi prescriptive in this example guiding principles may be that all crew members agree in advance of the modification and that the landing distance available exceeds the landing distance required by predetermined percentage allowing some guided decision making pilots will be more likely to trust and voluntarily comply with written policies in part because those policies will address the highly variable environments in which pilots work and also because the pilots will recognize that their expertise and real knowledge are being used in the risk process an increased agree on policy leads to increased buy and to the normalization of compliance stable approach criteria gates callout and decision points it is also worth discussing the relationship between the stable approach criteria the sah targets gates safe landing guidelines and decision points as the decision to go around remains possible up until the point of thrust deploy and go policies usually indicate that go should be initiated any time an aircraft becomes unstable below the sah then it follows that the decision point to go around defines the beginning of zone in which go is mandatory if the approach is unstable thrust reverser deployment defines the end of that zone most sop callout however channel flight crews to specific decision points to determine if they are in state in which it is safe to continue the approach these points are before thrust deploy these sop callout points are usually linked with sah leaving no formal stable callout for an extended period of time when go is viable active calls selection of calls that are mandatory for all varying objective conditions force communication between pilots passive or conditional calls on the other hand are only communicated if stimulated by condition the weakness in the passive call process is that if call is not made it could be for reasons other than the required objective condition being present for example if crew member did not see the condition call would not be made in addition crew member might choose not to make call for varying reasons such as subjective interpretation of the condition or fear of the cockpit authority structure active calls are always made and as stated they force com munic their absence indicates another problem such as pilot incapacitation many responsive callout by the pilot flying at sah or minimum approach height suggest what will happen what they are going to do for example suggestive calls like this to degree influence the decision to land and close the window for the decision to go around even though go may be required if the flight becomes unstable very late in the approach or landing repeated and escalated calls allow condition to remain alive in the conscious mind of the pilot on the other hand single callout for example at sah raises situational awareness about the condition at that moment as situational awareness is dynamic it can change quickly improving or worsening and callout that are designed to continue as long as the condition exists help to maintain awareness of that condition escalation of the calls can heighten awareness take the example of callout from enhanced ground proximity warning systems and other terrain awareness and warning systems the system alerts the flight crew to pending condition and continues with callout until the condition is no longer present the same effect can be ac com in unstable approach callout by both crew members and automated systems as the onset of approach instabilities can occur at any time even late in the landing phase keys to safe arrival the window for go decision follows that is the deci is not made at defined point at the sah the decision points for go are separate and distinct from the stable approach window and as such procedure designers can separate the two to maximize go decision making in reviewing the fsf alar task force elements of stabilized approach safety foundation alar task force we discover somewhat conflicting mes it states that approaches in instrument meteorological conditions must be stabilized before reaching ft agl visual meteorological conditions they must be stabilized before ft agl in precision non precision and visual approaches alike on the other hand the document indicates that descent below ft is acceptable in maneuver for circling approach and specifies that should be level on final when the aircraft reaches ft above airport elevation in other words on precision guided approach the documented guidance is that the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl in vmc and on circling non guided approach the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl it is not difficult for pilot to conclude that if it is acceptable and safe to fly off final approach profile until ft agl on non approach then it is also safe to fly an instrument approach to ft off profile although that is by definition unstable objective monitoring objective monitoring is that which does not require an individual to interpret information based on his or her ex or opinion it is usually factual information objective feedback in the cockpit minimizes the need for interpretation and can lead to more consistent and faster decision making additionally stating fact instead of interpreting inform making judgment or forming an opinion helps mini the effect of steep authority gradient in the cockpit such as may exist when low first officer is paired with high captain an example of objective feedback is that by an automated system such as egp ws in this case there is little subjective analysis done by the pilot when re to automated callout and the response can be quick and predictable this is in part why an automated energy management approach monitoring and alerting sy can be very effective in improving go compliance another example of the use of objective feedback is the use of radio altimeter automatic callout rather than interpreting radio altimeter readout information readouts can fluctuate due to terrain variances and must be observed and evaluated callout on the other hand are only heard in the absence of an automated energy management system after pilots cross the threshold they usually subjectively interpret or sense how much runway has passed by or how much remains from this they decide whether to conduct go if the pilot monitoring times the threshold crossing and then makes procedural call at the point where touchdown should occur or go should begin this call constitutes objective feedback to the pilot flying and makes clear that some either touchdown or go should occur should have occurred driven by policy and sops minimizing subjectivity in go decision pro is an objective that procedural designers should make every effort to achieve analysis management decision making overview of results in table we present data for managers self of their awareness of and if possible their specific estimates of both the industry and their own companies rates of compliance with unstable approach policy when asked whether they knew what the industry compliance rate was only percent of managers said that they did of those who claimed awareness however fewer were willing to estimate rate thirty managers percent of the participating offered an estimated rate which averaged percent compliance times the true rate and was highly variable percent to percent standard deviation percent only one in seven managers percent reported rate that was considered percent of the actual percent industry rate the perception of industry rates may not be the central concern of managers working to police their own noncompliance with unstable approach policy but this general lack of awareness and accuracy in estimating the true rate even among those claiming awareness cannot be overstated when asked whether they knew what their own company compliance rate was percent of managers said that they did although only percent offered an estimate of that rate thus majority of managers are largely unaware of unstable approach compliance and noncompliance rates even within their own companies of the managers who offered estimates the mean rate was percent compliance again with large range to percent and standard de percent these managers are estimating comp li rates at their companies that are on average more than percent above the industry average as they perceive it percent if their estimates were accurate they would indicate that the managers companies were outperforming the indus as whole by more than tenfold percent vs percent what is most striking is the tremendous degree of variability in the data revealing that there is very little common basis of perception even among those claiming knowledge of the rates at their own airlines in our view it is highly unlikely that this is an objective estimate for perceptions to have truly tracked with reality these data would mean that companies are ex the full range of compliance from zero to percent it is hard to imagine that this is the case and hard to imagine how this could result in an industry average that hovers at percent year after year table manager self of awareness and levels of ua policy compliance perceived rates of compliance with ua policy for the industry for their company flight operations as indicated by their company flight data analysis program awareness of rate claiming knowledge of each rate reporting rate of perceived rate of compliance not answer perceived rate of compliance those reporting go na not applicable sd standard deviation ua unstable approach source the presage group for flight safety foundation all companies percent had flight data anal program of the managers at those comp percent reported on their rate of compliance as indicated by their data these managers are not the same who reported on their companies flight operations compliance rates in answer to the prior question one in eight managers percent reported fda compliance rates broadly in line with the industry average less than percent at the opposite end of the spectrum percent re rates above percent the mean rate was percent again with wide range and variability to percent with standard deviation of percent that such spread of compliance rates is reported by this sample is surprising we believe it reflects not only general lack of awareness among managers of the rates of compliance with their own policies strongly indicated by the incidence of non but perhaps also specific errors within their knowledge although objective data are available this assertion can only be made however by again assuming that compliance rates exceeding percent are rare in the industry we cannot rule this out because although we have access to self data we lack objective verification of company compliance rates if the self rates are accurate it suggests that our sample is drawn from an unusually compliant subsample of companies in that light the lack of awareness effects across the manager study suggests that industry awareness could be less than estimated we begin with some overall observations about the data in table first on each of the three questions the norma response is to not know and only minority of man ag claim to know or report rate of compliance second as expected managers claim and report compliance rates for their own companies more frequently than they do for the industry as whole probably because they are less familiar with industry data third their perception of the industry compliance is out of line with reality six times greater than the actual percent rate of compliance fourth managers tell us as an aggregate sample that they believe their companies are outperforming the industry rate of compliance by to percent on average this is the equivalent of compliance rate at least times greater than the industry as whole finally if we assume that these com have more realistic unstable approach policy compliance rate below percent rate span still up to three times better than the current industry norm this would mean that only about one in seven managers to percent in the survey reported an accurate rate for their own companies whether their reporting was based on personal estimate or on their fda data if we give them more credit and allow that their companies actually achieved rates upward of percent then high accuracy of managers rates of report is still shared by fewer than one of the sample seven in simply do not know their own rates or if they do know they over their compliance rates by more than percent these kinds of perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence and complacency about mangers unstable approach policy compliance manager situational awareness profile manager perceptual measures of situational awareness managers completed questions to assess their attitudes beliefs and behaviors concerning their company go rates and unstable approach policies the results are in table first the responses were subjected to an empirical factor analysis to determine how they merged in managers minds and to provide simpler summary categories for presentation and discussion three of the four factors to emerge had more than one associated question one factor was single assessment of behavior namely whether the respondent debriefed flight crew who had violated the com unstable approach policy factor theme was the perceived support that the re spon received from their companies in understanding and managing go rates the six questions this factor com were averaged and called support factor comprised questions assessing the degree to which managers thought that their companies unstable approach policies and procedures and their associated operational definitions were effective clear and appropriate responses to five questions were averaged to create an index of effectiveness finally factor was an expression of man ag concerns about and sense of urgency surrounding their companies go rates it was formulated by averaging responses to the five questions shown in table and named threat in addition to the four factors we present overall measures recorded by managers of their satisfaction with and the per effectiveness of their companies go policies and procedures as they relate to unstable approaches the first thing to notice in table about these manager per is the absolute levels of the means on the underlying six scale six scale did not offer midpoint but instead presented the opportunity to report slight moder or strong agreement or disagreement with each statement or assertion the midscale is on this to like rt scale like rt scale is

managers perceive moderate degree of effectiveness of their policies and procedures and slightly less than moderate level of up from their organizations in managing their go rates the overall measure of perceived effectiveness was slightly weaker than the index score of effectiveness overall satisfaction with compliance rates associated with their flight operation go policies while slightly lower was still on the positive side of the scale in concert with this pattern perhaps because of these perceptions and judgments man slightly disagreed overall threat that there was cause for concern or need for action to improve their go rates taken together these absolute scores indicate that man ag are not completely happy with their companies per for on go policy and procedures but their concerns are not great enough seemingly to stimulate greater aware or action as an aside regression analysis of the drivers of the effectiveness and satisfaction scores revealed that overall effectiveness is perceived in proportion to scores on the perceived effectiveness index and to lesser degree the lack of urgency and concern is expressed by scores on the perceived threat index in complementary fashion over satisfaction was driven first by lower perceived threat scores and secondarily by higher perceptions reflected in the perceived effectiveness index these meaningful differential patterns were observed although the overall measures of satisfaction and effectiveness were high finally managers on average narrowly agreed that they all flight crews who have broken our company policies on operational procedures for go taken at its face per disagree that all flight crews are debriefed high absolute number of managers who admit to less than complete debriefing protocols however while this may seem like high percentage the fact that the statement was phrased as debrief as opposed to company debriefs may account for the response to examine the relationships between positive perceptions of organizational support compliance effectiveness satis fac and low concern with their go rates we studied responses from only those managers who had reported on their companies fda go compliance rates that is of all those claiming knowledge of this inform we divided them into managers whose reports were generally close to the industry average of percent accept anyone who reported rate of less than percent into group we labeled reporting what looked like reasonably accurate rate compared with the industry base rate all other managers reported compliance rates from to percent and were placed in comparison group labeled reporting compliance rate not likely to be accurate the results show that stating an rate of comp li is associated at significant statistical levels with higher scores on two of the five questions on the second factor of per effectiveness the effectiveness index as whole and the overall single measure of effectiveness effective it is also correlated with lower scores on the perceived threat index and four of its five component questions while this pattern may seem obvious in hindsight it makes the point that independent of the level of support perceived for man ag company go rates were no differences on the perceived support index the perception of the company policies as effective and the threat as low may flow from basic lack of realistic knowledge or appraisal of the go compliance rates if this causal effect is true that is posi perceptions lead to low perceived threat then what is clearly indicated by these data is the need for consciousness raising about the industry norm of massive noncompliance and dissemination of the managers own companies data identifying their internal rates of unstable approach around policy compliance and noncompliance segmentation analysis to determine whether the sample included types of man ag whose views of their company go compliance rate and performance were consistent with each other and also different from other identified groups we conducted traditional cluster analysis on this sample of managers non agglomerative cluster analysis based on euclidean distances due to the small sample size we generated just two groups to compare and based the mathematics of this segmentation on variety of responses given in the survey this of segmentation consisted of the perception questions and the two overall measures of effectiveness and satisfaction all the measures presented in table not surprisingly the resulting groups consisted of one whose members perceived high risk in their go compliance rates risk perceivers group and second group whose members had more moderate view risk perceivers group the percent of man ag who perceived high risk differed from the percent of low perceivers on almost all measures in the survey and powerfully so in both the statistical sense and the magnitude sense degree of statistical difference table shows that on of measures and on all three indexes the high risk perceiver group showed pattern of higher concern and perceived threat lower satisfaction with their companies go compliance lower perceived policy and compliance presage

safety foundation effectiveness and lower perceived support from the organ iz for managing go rates they also reported lower rates of debriefing their noncompliant flight crews when we profiled these two groups on other measures collected in the study we found interesting correlated ef for example high risk perceiver types tended to see their company compliance rates as slightly under perform relative to industry norms whereas low risk perceiver types reported that their companies were definitely outperforming the industry compliance rate high risk types were more likely to claim that prior to the study they had been aware of the industry rate and of their own company flight operations rate of compliance interestingly those in the high risk perceiver group were more likely to report being in roles in which they had less power to effect change more often saying they were able only to offer re com added to the fact that members of the high risk perceiver group were three times less likely than those in the low risk perceiver group to say their compliance rates were between and percent suspect number and more than four times as likely to say that their fda showed their rate was between zero and percent number more in line with industry norms picture emerges of group whose members are more realistic and appropriately anxious and concerned about their companies low rates of go compliance but who perhaps have little voice or power within the company to change policy or procedures they see as more likely to be unrealistic or to offer new definition of what should constitute stable approach they see as overly narrow how did these managers score on the presage indices of situational awareness this situation presents clear instance of violation via near noncompliance of most airlines policies and procedures surrounding unstable approach go performance rates and their manage as such our metrics are likely to show low absolute scores on scale of to with corresponding to high safety awareness the first column of table which displays these scores for the overall sample shows this to be the case in no case does the absolute score on any of our awareness metrics exceed the midscale of safety awareness is low in all of the awareness areas assessed by our system we know in this instance that unstable approach go noncompliance is major problem for the industry our measures of situational awareness are scored higher when this problem is recognized to be present in the ap to scoring shown in table all measures are scored such that higher numbers indicate greater degree of realistic threat awareness and appraisal as result higher situational awareness on our measures is associated with seeing the cur threat to be real anticipatory awareness and the procedural measures used to compensate for it to be in ad adjusting to the threat managers with higher situational awareness see their current procedures as un re and the definitions of instability as too narrow scores on knowing the procedures and knowing the limits their experience awareness high reliance on ex peri tells them there is problem and they feel more anxious and eager to take action against this safety threat gut feeling for threats however because new plan is needed in the face of general lack of appreciation of the threat to compliance in their organizations higher awareness is also associated with perception that their companies have little will to change and are generally complacent about the sops in place to manage the threat relational and corporate support for safety as result those with higher awareness also feel less support from and higher level of discomfort in approaching senior management to broach the issue with this understanding of our scoring methods in mind we examined the scores of the two groups the managers who reported compliance rate based on their fda that was than percent versus those who overest the compliance rate percent or more we hypoth sized that more accurate awareness of the true low rate of compliance would be associated with heightened sense of awareness perceived threat and anxiety the felt need to com etc all aspects of the situational awareness model we predicted therefore that managers who were aware of the actual low rate of compliance with unstable approach around policies at their airlines would receive higher scores on all nine of our metrics than their colleagues who were unaware even if the magnitude of these scores was still low in absolute terms when compared to the scale range in table it can be seen that on seven of our nine metrics of situational awareness the hypothesis that the go respondents would report greater situational awareness was supported at level of statistical reliability of percent or better that is if this experiment were repeated times we would observe the same differences in of the replications only on the procedures and each other safe were the levels of awareness similar for the two groups albeit at low absolute levels in summary those aware of the low compliance rates at their companies scored at or above the midscale on five of our metrics critical af fec anticipatory and compensatory if minimum midscale threshold of situational awareness across majority of our measures was enough to trigger some action the individuals in this group were close to reaching such trigger point how note that this group constituted just percent of of our sample small minority coming to full aware of the problem table also shows results derived from cluster analysis on the presage metrics for the two groups those perceiving relatively high risk in their companies unstable approach around policies and rates percent of sample and those not generally perceiving such risks percent will be recalled these groups were designed for all managers in the sample irrespective of whether they claimed to know or ventured to report what their company compliance rate actually was according to fda or otherwise in this case all nine awareness factors are statistically reliably different with five means above the midscale for the high perception group these results are more encouraging in terms of the complement of managers perhaps ready to act in this important area of noncompliance as about one of the sample shows signs of having reached threshold of aware that will trigger activity to manage this issue more safely in the near future as demonstration of the effect that improved awareness in one area can have on overall situational awareness we compared the situational awareness scores of all managers with the scores of the group whose members were aware of their internal company go compliance rates figure shows the incremental benefit that awareness in one area can have across eight of the nine constructs finally it is relevant to discuss the industry approach to monitoring unstable approach flight data as many flight data monitoring programs are set to report only when more than one stable approach criterion is exceeded and in some programs to report only low level alert until three or more criteria are exceeded we see an indication from those responsible for the design of these programs that there is an acknowledged variability in the risk of unstable approaches and more importantly there is an indication of disc on between the level of management concern for low risk unstable approaches and the policy guidance for flight crews on those same approaches which is to execute go when one or more criteria are exceeded from the per spec of the flight crews why should they be concerned about the risk of this level of unstable approaches if management is not concerned enough to want to be told about them or act on situational awareness of managers who knew company compliance rules feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits cop orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures additional bene base score source the presage group for flight safety foundation them this is consistent with the results of both the pilot and management psychological studies industry sensing the conversation about reducing the risk of alas often drifts toward how to eliminate unstable approaches even though the discussion begins with focus on rates of compliance with go policies it is clear that there is larger disco with the existence of unstable approaches despite the fact that the industry has reduced unstable approaches to percent or less in an industry with such variable objective environments one must ask is the lowest attainable unstable approach rate it makes sense that an industry with almost nonexistent compliance with go policies would be concerned about the small number of unstable approaches that occur if we turn the tables and consider for moment an industry with high rate of go policy compliance would there be as much concern about unstable approaches and is the focus on eliminating unstable approaches the right strategy in reducing alas in flight safety foundation year study of runway excursions conducted in we see that percent of the landing excursions were las as veer and of these percent followed stable approach that became unstable during the landing phase only percent of the landing excursions followed unstable approaches overruns accounted for the other percent of landing excursions percent of overruns followed stable approaches and percent followed unstable approaches in total percent of landing runway excursions followed stable approaches and an almost number per followed unstable approaches separate analysis by boeing of runway overrun excursions from to found that percent followed stable approaches and aaron drawing from this concentrated effort to reduce figure overall manager situational awareness scores feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits cop orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures source the presage group for flight safety foundation number of unstable approaches that become unstable in the approach phase will address less than half of all landing excursions on the other hand reliable go decision making operation has the potential to affect most landing ex those occurring after flights that become unstable during the approach or landing phase clearly strategy to continue improving the stable approach rate in addition to improving the go compliance rate is the most com strategy the point of this discussion is to illustrate that the industry tendency to focus only on eliminating unstable approaches will not address large portion of alas and that improving the go compliance rate holds the greater risk potential in an fsf runway safety initiative determined that gap existed in alar tool kit risk reduction tools which did not address the landing phase itself the foundation then developed safe landing guidelines keys to safe arrival which are intended to be used by aircraft operators to enhance existing sops throughout this project and through industry confer and meetings it was apparent that these guidelines were not well known or commonly documented in company manuals these findings were not part of the data collection surveys findings go decision making the following are decision findings drawn from analysis mp denotes decision pilot findings and mm denotes decision management findings mp finding the unstable approach pilot group gut feeling for threats the of the pants experience characterized by an emotional sensory experience that triggers further cog ni analysis is lower than it is for the go pilot group mp finding the unstable approach pilot group ability to see and monitor real and potential threats as they change over time and space is lower than that of the go pilot group mp finding the unstable approach pilot group is more likely than the go pilot group to minimize efforts to discuss instability and environmental factors with other crew members and to shut themselves off from available resources mp finding unstable approach pilots are more tolerant than go pilots of deviations from operational limits and

lack of support for decision to go around mp finding unstable approach pilots are more likely than go pilots to feel discomfort in being challenged or chal others finding unstable approach pilots are likely to feel in about calling for go in situations with strong cockpit authority gradient mp finding go pilots indicated four times more often than unstable approach pilots that another crew mem ber was prompting the crew to initiate go mp finding unstable approach pilots are less likely than go pilots to feel support for safety from their companies and said they were less likely to be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to landing and more likely to believe that the incentive structure of their company does not discourage unstable approaches to landing mp finding unstable approach pilots believe that their com criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic mp finding unstable approach pilots in hindsight feel regret about continuing an unstable approach more strongly than go pilots regret going around and feel less positive about the outcomes of their decisions mp finding unstable approach pilots have lower sense of situational awareness across most facets which leads them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their risk assessments finding pilot norms and processes for continuing unstable approaches provide little foundation for

assessment and decision making finding pilots who believe that their company criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe on whole that the threshold for the aircraft to be on profile and in proper configuration is below ft closer to to ft agl mp finding pilots who believe that their company criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe on whole that they can compensate for energy management until the aircraft descends to ft agl and under certain conditions below ft mm finding at the managerial level there are indications of general disengagement with the topic of go policy and procedures mm finding among managers there is general lack of awareness of industry rates of go policy compliance finding among managers there is general lack of awareness of their own company rates of go policy compliance finding among managers who have objective go noncompliance rate data such as flight data understanding of the compliance rate is likely inaccurate mm

or authority within the company to change policy or procedures mm finding managers who scored higher on the situational awareness measure associated with seeing the current threat as real awareness also scored lower in relative terms on the measure used to compensate correctly for the risk awareness suggesting the presence of helplessness with respect to effectively managing this risk mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores see their current procedures as being unrealistic and definitions of instabilities as being too narrow mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores had the perception that their companies have little will to change and are generally complacent about sops for managing go compliance mm finding managers with higher awareness of their companies go compliance rates also feel less support from senior managers and higher level of discomfort with ap them about the issue mm finding managers who were aware of low go compliance rates in their companies scored at or above the midscale on functional critical affective anticipatory and compensatory situational awareness metrics this is minority consisting of percent of respondents mm finding the industry tendency is to lean toward the single focus of improving the unstable approach rate as the best way to prevent alas even though empirical data indicate otherwise finding safe landing guidelines published by flight safety foundation to address an identified gap in the alar tool kit risk reduction tools is not well known by operators and not documented in operations manuals strategies for corrective action go decision making we conclude that there are three high categories that can be defined in achieving an effective policy from psycho logi perspective the policy should make sense operationally for most environmental conditions encountered for the people executing the policy crews and those managing the policy operations management and should be acceptable to those externally effected by the application of the policy traffic controllers the policy must be managed effectively by the organ iz tion management personnel this is important not only because of the organization need to achieve objectives set out by senior management but also because those exec ut the policy crews need to see and understand that the policy is being managed management over of the policy is apparent awareness of the policy guidance and the risks associated with not executing the policy must be high for both flight crews and management the following is list of recommended higher decision making strategies to mitigate go noncompliance dm strategy ensure the policy makes sense operationally update the stable approach definition and sah to maximize their relevance to flight crews and their manageability separate the stable approach definition and criteria from decision criteria and decision points to improve awareness that these are two distinct aspects of go policies and that decision making continues beyond the approach phase this does not imply that they cannot meet at points throughout the approach and landing it is intended for the sop and communication designers to separate the psychological attachment of these two aspects dm strategy manage the policy effectively operators set specific compliance rate targets per for indicators and establish initiatives to achieve them authorities amend industry and regulatory audit pro to include standards and recommended practices that address go noncompliance dm strategy increase awareness increase awareness of go noncompliance and risks associated with continuing to land when unstable and awareness of the significant impact that noncom pli has on alas among operator management ii flight crews iii industry and pilot associations regulators and manufacturers enhance situational awareness awareness to heighten flight crews awareness throughout the ap and beyond and landing through policy and procedural enhancements and ii communication improvements minimize the subjectivity of go decision making for the decision maker pf or captain as per com policy to mitigate those components of situational awareness that compromise the pilot risk assessment and decision ability for example by installing stable approach monitoring systems recommendations go decision making the following are decision recommendations for corrective action to mitigate go noncompliance and go execution risks each recommendation supports previously identified higher strategy dm recommendation manufacturers should continue develop of and operators should install stable approach and energy management monitoring and alerting systems dm recommendation operators should understand their own respective go compliance rates dm recommendation operators should establish internal go around compliance rate measures targets and goals dm recommendation where necessary flight crew assoc ia and operator management should establish basis and or process in which fda can be used to assist in effectively managing go compliance targets dm recommendation operators and the industry should re the stable approach criteria and sah to better align policies with manageable and operational safe practices see appendix for flight safety foundation analysis new stabilized approach and go guidelines for industry validation avoid stable approach criteria and heights that address very low approaches that is avoid criteria that if exceeded are not likely to result in go decision or that if go decision is made may transfer risk to higher go maneuver distinguish between profile criteria and lateral energy management criteria and go decision point criteria which could have distinct and separate heights allow for variable objective environments not all environ ment create the same risk profile high crosswind tail winds and contaminated runways statistically create the highest environments the stable approach criteria although mostly prescriptive should allow an element of guided risk decision making that is corroborated between crew members dm recommendation operators should establish and publish safe landing guidelines in operations manuals keys to safe arrival and bla je see appendix analysis revised safe landing guidelines for industry validation dm recommendation operators should develop com munic procedures to be performed during every approach that describes the state of stability and the intention of the decision maker based on company policy effective elements of these communications include the state of stability is made by the crew member not responsible for the decision to go around the pm or the first officer per company policy this creates shared responsibility for activity in the decision process communication procedures are active not passive or conditional call is made at the assigned point during every approach this forces communication communication procedures should be objective they should state facts about the condition this minimizes authority gradients within the cockpit communication procedures should be sequential and esca late if the condition is not corrected to within limits ac calls continue and escalate to defined point at which new directive call is mandated for example if an call at ft agl does not result in successful corrective action the calls continue every ft until the condition is corrected or critical point is reached and then directive call is made this maintains continuous situational awareness updating of the condition similar to ground warning system calls active communication should continue well into the ap proach and landing up to the touchdown limit point this maintains continuous situational awareness each condition call should be answered with an ac or notice call by the decision maker pf or captain per company policy the call should not suggest the exclusion of other possible outcomes calling at mini when go is an option can have the effect of minimizing the window of calling for go on the other hand responding with or assists in keeping decision making open dm recommendation operators should apply objective feedback procedures well into the approach and landing phase including in the touchdown zone energy management monitoring and alerting systems will minimize the need for crew calls dm recommendation operators should create standard pre descent briefing guidelines that include environmental risk factors instability factors that will result in go review of standard calls and decision making in the landing phase recommendation operators should create standard pre approach briefing guidelines that update the pre brief at low period just before the approach is begun dm recommendation operators should understand their re spec managers and flight crews situational awareness levels and psychological profiles for managing internal go policies dm recommendation operators should provide training to enhance psychosocial awareness and management and how they contribute to noncompliant decision making dm recommendation operators should ensure no fault go around policies are documented implemented and understood by management and flight crew dm recommendation operators should ensure that un approach and go policies are concise and un am big uous including follow procedures and expectations for noncompliance recommendation operators should communicate indus rates and internal go compliance rates measures targets and goals of performance to flight crews and the man ag involved in achieving them operators also should co mmu the risk potential that improved performance could have on the company overall risk profile dm recommendation state and industry audit programs such as the iata operational safety audit should establish go compliance standards and recommended practices for operators to manage go compliance dm recommendation state and industry safety organizations such as those associated with the international civil aviation organization the european aviation safety agency faa iata the faa commercial aviation safety team etc should review these recommendations and assess inserting them into their safety publications dm recommendation the aviation community should annually track through global aggregate flight data go compliance rates for both the approach phase and the landing phase of flight and communicate the findings to the industry this role is suited to safety organizations such as flight safety foundation dm recommendation the aviation community should develop and implement an initiative that communicates the industry go compliance rate and the risk potential that improved performance could have on the industry ala rate and the overall accident rate this is role suited to regulators global associations and safety organ such as flight safety foundation dm recommendation the aviation community should estab new information program to provide method for operators to share effective strategies to improve go around compliance rates alternatively the information should be incorporated into an existing program dm recommendation the industry should establish an ident fi for the threat effect of the phenomenon of noncompliance with go polices as labels such as con flight into terrain or loss of control make it easier for the industry to relate discuss understand and manage phenomenon label for this phenomenon will do the same and in so doing will help provide foundation for essential awareness effective utility of each recommendation is different and each recommendation addresses different finding or strategy as can be seen in appendix holistic approach to implementing these recommendations will have the best overall effect and as with any significant program change desired and undesired effects should be closely monitored by an appropriate audit program such as fda line operations safety audits or ios go execution methodology the go accident and incident review included non random selection of published reports on go in vol transport aircraft between and total of go events were included in some the safety of the go was central to the investigation and in others the go occurred in the aftermath of the event at the heart of the investigation the majority of the events percent involved single jets others involved twin turboprops percent and twin jets percent the nature of the sample independently investigated events in which an approach was followed at some point by go around meant that the sample group contained both safe and unsafe go sometimes the investigations focused on the circumstances that led to the go sometimes they focused on the go itself and sometimes they focused on both remarks contrasting the safe go with the risk bearing go are therefore subject to the qualification that the safe ones were just non subset of many more similar go that are routinely conducted because of both crew decisions and atc instructions the context safety aspects and overall level of risk of each event were shown on spreadsheet with as many of elec of as were applicable attached to each one not all tags were mutually exclusive and not all reports allowed the applicability of all of the tags to be established the extent to which many characteristics could be identified is therefore understated on the basis of the degree of risk posed by go each event was assigned to one of three categories high risk events moderate risk events and non events the non events involved circumstances some of which were similar to those of risk events that were the main concern of the investigation for the two risk categories six go around safety issues were defined in respect to the initiation and execution of each go most of the risk bearing events involved single gas but five events were assigned two gas is each each risk event was assigned one of three risks loc fit or midair collision the gas definitions and their associated outcome risks were ao initiation of go ineffective ao safe trajectory of aircraft not maintained once go around successfully initiated ao go not flown on required track at safe traffic separation not maintained during go around at wake turbulence hazard during go and en significant low wind shear during go in the percent of risk go in which the risk was attributable to the mismanagement and mishandling of the go by pilots failure to initiate go effectively was twice as prevalent as the failure to aviate and navigate properly once the go was initially established in the percent of risk go in which the risk was attributable to air traffic controllers the follow conditions applied one go followed controller failure to apply clearly established procedures in respect to late go which led directly to an unrecognized mac risk resolved by traffic and collision avoidance system resolution advisory five go involved controller misjudgments in dealing with the proximity of takeoffs to unexpected go around significant loss of separation in four cases and an unrecognized wake turbulence hazard in the other two events involved controllers talking to different aircraft on the same frequency in different languages in both cases pilots seeking to understand the developing situ both before and after the go began were deprived of valuable situational awareness two go involved single conflict between pilot declared go and controller go in which trainee controller under supervision in non radar environment was faced with an aircraft transition to conventional go and the resulting need to instruct the potentially conflicting aircraft which was on required navigation performance approach to fly an rn go the situational awareness of each flight crew both on go in imc of the potential proximity of the other aircraft was compromised by lack of procedure awareness decisions by pilots that were followed by poor initiation of go and that led to hull loss accidents in an airplane is destroyed or damaged and not repaired including events in which an airplane is missing or in acce due to either loc or fit were particularly likely to in crew in which either the pilot or the first officer was lacking in experience for the pic this lack of experience involved experience in either the aircraft type or the role of pic for the first officer it involved experience in the aircraft type or in multi operations generally all events in which the experience of both pilots was fully documented one or both pilots were low on experience ac to the above definitions in percent of fatal loss go accidents percent of all high go percent of all moderate go and percent of all non go excessive confidence by the pm pic that the pf first officer would achieve timely stabilization of the approach led the pic to delay takeover as pf often by the time the pic took the controls the circumstances had become more complex and the chances of not properly initiating the go had increased conversely excessive confidence by the pm first officer that the pf pic would achieve timely stabilization led in operating cultures that may not have addressed the effect of significant relative experience gap between the first officer and the pic to delayed or absent go call and in some cases to near takeover or an on takeover of control in order to make such call the more go are more likely than safer go around to have been preceded by one or more of the following significant procedural noncompliance which was recorded in percent of high events but in only percent of moderate events the same percentage as reported in non events delay in making the decision to go around which was re corded in percent of high events but only percent of medium events an even lower proportion than for non events and complex situation at the time of the go decision which was recorded in percent of high events but only percent of medium events about the same as for non events significant violation of landing minimums followed by go around decision was particular precursor of the nine fatal defined in this analysis as one or both of hours on type or hours in command defined in this analysis as one or both of hours multi experience or hours on type accidents during subsequently attempted go four percent of risk go decisions were made above ft half of these decisions were made because of an unstable approach condition compared with moderate go high go around are more likely

surprise that they have become necessary high go are less likely to follow an unstabilized approach and involve change of pf at initiation of or during the go compared with moderate go non go are more likely to follow go decisions that were foreseen as poss bili rather than those that occurred unexpectedly and be made on atc instructions they are less likely to take place at night involve pilots with low levels of experience have the first officer as pf and involve surprise that they have become necessary they are just as likely to be preceded by significant procedural noncompliance and involve change of pf at the initiation of or during the go analysis go execution the go flight operations data analysis was performed with the objective of examining the prevalence of go safety risk during normal routine operations more than go events flown by jet aircraft operated by range of airlines from around the world were examined the analysis focused on the point at which the go began and the way it was conducted go events were found in data detailing almost flights the majority of these flights percent involved single jets twin jets made up the remain percent data showed that percent of the flight crews disc on the autopilot above ft percent disconnected the auto throttle above flare altitudes and percent disc on the flight director during the approach data showed the overall rate of go was percent or in approaches however it was possible to distinguish two subgroups lower go rate of percent for operators that appeared more likely to sub se divert following go and higher rate of percent for operators that appeared less likely to do so the go rate for long operations was percent higher than the overall rate for single jets the autopilot was engaged prior to go initiation in percent of the events and remained engaged in percent of these cases for twin jets the autopilot was engaged prior to the go initiation in percent of the events and remained engaged in percent of these cases forty percent of all go were initiated below ft percent were initiated below the category instrument landing system ils minimum height of ft and percent were initiated below ft exceed ance of the maximum permitted airspeed with flaps extended fe was recorded in percent of single jet go and percent of the twin jet go these fe exceed ance correlated with failure to reach and maintain the appropriate pitch target extended duration of go power settings an elapsed time of more than seconds without re trac of one stage of flaps applied in percent of cases and unstable approach an overall association was identified between the height on the approach at which go was initiated and the pitch attitude at which it was then flown the earlier the initiation of the go the lower the pitch attitude the data showed widespread prevalence of delayed flap retraction once go had been initiated whereas in only percent of go did it take more than seconds to retract the landing gear findings go execution go safety forum initiated by flight safety foundation the european regions airline association and euro control took place june at euro control headquarters in brussels it was held in support of the flight safety foundation go safety initiative to assist in early implementation of the actions detailed in the european action plan for the prevention of runway excursions issued in january the conference was attended by over par including members of the french bureau et who were conducting study of airplane state awareness during go the execution findings findings from the go safety forum included the following safety found era euro control ex finding go occur at an average rate of one to three per approaches there is large variation of go around rates among different aircraft operators and operational environments ex finding the go is normal phase of flight and pilots should be encouraged to conduct one when conditions warrant as well as when they are instructed to do so however since go is the least flown normal flight phase there are particular safety issues associated with it ex finding one in go reports record potentially hazardous outcome including exceeded aircraft performance limits or fuel endurance ex finding go is relatively rare maneuver for most commercial pilots on average short pilot may conduct go once or twice year and long pilot may conduct one every two to three years ex finding conducting go carries number of risks including ineffective initiation of go which can lead to loc failure to maintain control during go which can lead to loc including abnormal contact with the runway or to fit failure to fly the required track which can lead to fit or mac failure to maintain traffic separation which can lead to mac and generation of wake turbulence which may create hazard for another aircraft that can lead to loc ex finding the height at which go is initiated during an approach can present different challenges and risks above the approach procedure minimum altitude at the approach procedure minimum altitude and below the approach minimum altitude finding low relevant experience of one or both pilots is associated with difficulty in flying go ex finding go that follow violation of approach minimums are associated with reduced safety margin ex finding it is necessary for operators to be aware of the extent to which go are being flown and the validated reasons for them as well as the extent to which the go are flown safely ex finding just culture must prevail if problems in go around safety are to be sufficiently understood and addressed ex finding aircraft energy states that are too high or too low make the safe execution of go less likely and this situation can be exacerbated by failure to understand how to manage aircraft pitch attitude ex finding the safety of go is compromised by de in deciding to begin go when the aircraft becomes unstabilized below mandatory stabilized approach gate approach gates ex finding the decisions that precede unsafe go are often made at points other than pre procedural decision points finding pilot go training needs to be pro por to the rate at which go are experienced in line operations ex finding the effectiveness of flight deck monitoring can have significant effect on the safe execution of go but such monitoring often is poor ex finding lack of an adequate understanding of automation by pilots can affect go safety ex finding pilot understanding of how the pitch control system works is not always apparent in their actions during go ex finding the potential for traffic and wake vortex conflict during go is sometimes reduced if pilots are unaware of other traffic in the vicinity ex finding most pilots fly the potentially complex transition to go from circle approach so infrequently that maintaining competency will require an unrealistic amount of recurrent training in proportion to other requirements ex finding the extent of controller training in respect to go around risk management is variable ex finding controllers sometimes issue instructions that may prevent pilots from conducting stabilized approach and may thereby increase the number of go ex finding go procedures can be complex at time of high workload for pilots the procedures are not always published tactical de of go can place high demands on controllers complexity is increased when there are multiple approach procedures for the same runway each with its own missed approach point ex finding too much information in one controller radio transmission an explanation of the reason when giving an executive instruction can lead to pilot confusion late provision of or changes to go instructions late changes to published map unless these clearly simplify it increase workload for pilots ex finding some pilots are reluctant to decline acceptance of atc instructions that are not compatible with aircraft per especially when issued at times when pilot work is already high issuing unpublished go approach tactical instructions at or after the initiation of go can place high demands on pilots there is no direct link between aircraft operator and atc go training awareness ex finding current pilot go procedures may not adequately address all the circumstances in which an ad hoc go around decision may be made especially above ft agl or after decision to continue an approach made at da ex finding go operational challenges are not ad reflected in current regulatory requirements strategies for corrective action go execution the safety forum discussed in depth the issues related to go around decision making execution and training and the air traffic management aspects of safe go forum par agreed on series of conclusions in respect to eight safety improvement strategies three of these strategies were execution strategies strategies related to the safe execution of go ex strategy ensure that go training and awareness ap reflect different go execution risk scenarios note independent cast analysis determined similar find and recommendations which are outlined in cast safety enhancement ex strategy review go policy procedures and ocu men to maximize their effectiveness clarity and understanding ex strategy ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew members does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitor during approach landing and go recommendations go execution the following principal recommendations for safe go execution recommendations are based on safety forum conclusions ex recommendation aircraft operators and atc should im their mutual understanding of each other go practices ex recommendation industry partners should develop go around training aids ex recommendation effective monitoring depends on ensuring that pilots with low relevant experience are able to contribute to safe go decision making and execution ex recommendation pilots and their employers should under that one of the many reasons that violating approach minimums is unacceptable is because evidence indicates that if go then becomes necessary the chances of safe transition to the go are reduced ex recommendation pilots must be able to demonstrate that they are able to safely execute go that begin from both high energy and low energy states at the point where go around decision is indicated ex recommendation pilots must be able to exercise tactical judgment as well as procedural compliance when deciding to go around below stabilized approach gate so that safe execution is not hindered by an inappropriate delay in decision making validation of this must be achieved through realistic training scenarios ex recommendation go training for pilots should include range of operational scenarios including go from positions other than da and the designated sta approach gate scenarios should involve realistic simulation of surprise typical landing weights and full go ex recommendation go training for both pilots and controllers should incorporate lessons learned from operational events ex recommendation clear guidance should be provided to pilots on how to act in respect to the three stages of monitoring during approach landing and go noticing alerting and taking control members of augmented crews who are observing should have clear understanding of the nature of their contr to effective monitoring ex recommendation if an aircraft has the capability to fly automatic go pilot training should be provided and the operator automation policy should address the go procedure ex recommendation pilots must have clear understanding of how the pitch control system works on the aircraft type that they fly this should be validated by both theoretical testing and use of suitable full flight simulator exercises involving approach and go with full rather than reduced power available and at typical landing weights ex recommendation review should be conducted to deter whether pilots can lose situational awareness of pot en conflicting traffic during go if other pilots are exchanging radio transmissions with atc in languages other than english ex recommendation high priority should be accorded to the provision of rn approach and missed approach pro ce dures when current procedures involve circle and when active radar surveillance of the transition to go is not available consideration should be given to withdrawing circle procedures at airports where neither option is available ex recommendation air navigation service providers should review and if necessary enhance the provision of go around risk awareness training for controllers ex recommendation ensure that the importance of fac lit at stabilized approach and the correct application of final approach procedures is included in training and in briefings for atc staff recommendation implementation advice training should include appropriate speed control instructions timely descent instructions the importance of avoiding late change of runway or change in the type of approach the importance of assigning landing runway with no significant tail wind component the need to avoid vectoring too tightly onto final ap and intercepting glide path from above and the importance of providing the crew with correct information about distance to touchdown ex recommendation the agency responsible for instrument approach procedure design should ensure that straightforward go procedures are available and published for each runway these go procedures should be designed in consultation with pilots who are representative of those who will be expected to use them advice the principles which underlie the map for each run should as much as possible be the same low below ft first stop altitude and an early turn in missed approach procedure should be avoided conditional go procedures approach procedures xxx but not later than yy should be avoided the common missed approach fix should be located close to the airport to ensure that an aircraft in trouble can be landed immediately on any runway with any track chosen by the pilot procedural de of the missed approach path from other traffic and from the risk of exposure to wake turbulence especially from late go should be provided if both rn and conventional missed approach pro ce are published then an explicit risk assessment of such availability should be performed environmental restrictions especially noise abatement restrictions must not affect the design of missed approach procedures if their imposition would compromise safety standards ex recommendation on final approach pilots should be advised of any significant changes in weather and runway surface conditions contingency arrangements should exist for use in wind shear conditions implementation advice pilots should receive more relevant and quicker up of weather information about develop such as changes in visibility wind and runway status quantity of water on the runway improved information should be provided to crews about tail winds wind shear and significant wind variation including reports from preceding aircraft runway information should include items such as braking action reports information about the pre of standing water debris and wildlife including birds reports of technical problems on the ground and reports of laser interference ex recommendation guidance should be developed for controllers regarding the content and timing of go instructions advice controllers should consider whether go instruction should be delivered in separate trans mis from one that explains the instruction controllers must always use the standard map if there is no imperative reason for an adaptation if non missed approach procedure is to be followed controllers should detail it when issuing the approach clearance controllers should avoid last changes or in except in emergency situations once pilot has declared go or is otherwise known to have begun one controllers should avoid unnecessary transmissions pilot should inform atc as soon as possible if devi from the published go procedure become necessary ex recommendation an sps should consider the feasibility of establishing formal interface between pilots and controllers to explore operational issues and reach an understanding implementation advice pilots can be invited to attend controllers training sessions and controllers may be able to arrange to observe pilots training sessions days can be provided for pilots to observe operations at atc facilities and it may be possible to organize familiarization flights for controllers pilots and controllers should participate in joint crew resource management training in establishing such interfaces be aware that it is most unlikely that the pilots participating in such an initiative will be representative of those using the atc services involved and any such bias must be explicitly recognized ex recommendation aircraft manufacturers should ensure that go procedures presented in aircraft pilot training and aircraft operating manuals are applicable to go that are begun at any stage on final approach up to and including land that are rejected after touchdown ex recommendation safety regulators should review current mandatory go training requirements for both pilots and controllers and should ensure that the conclusions of this report are appropriately addressed flight safety foundation future work establish go noncompliance industry label such as gan noncompliance or fga to go around this is to establish easy recognition as has been accomplished with other labels such as loc or fit analyze and report at global aggregate level unstable approaches and unstable landings to determine the level of associated risk report global go compliance performance annually develop go execution and training guidelines for operators establish industry go noncompliance audit standards and recommended practices with organizations such as the international civil aviation organization and iata in order to minimize the exposure to unnecessary go while ensuring safety further analysis is required to deter the risk balance point between an unstable approach and go the foundation should ensure industry partners pursue this analysis promote the distribution and presentation of this report in industry and encourage republication in complementing publications and safety initiatives project conclusion the problem of go policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the largest threat to flight safety today the potential impact of improvement in compliance is igni fi no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go around the first and foremost change required is that the industry must improve its awareness of the problem to achieve this shift in focus and cultural norms is required it is believed that significant improvement is attainable however the cultural shift will be much easier if the industry shifts collectively as opposed to individual companies making changes on their own having said this several companies are already attacking this issue internally the project accomplished the goals set forth in the document announcing the fsf go safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight crew members and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight managers and to consider the safety risk associated with go and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines

fully stabilized when all of the following criteria are met pro only small changes in heading are required to maintain the correct flight path profile specific types of approaches are stabilized if

airspeed is stabilized within ref kt to ref wind adjustments thrust is stabilized to maintain the target approach airspeed sink rate is no greater than fpm general the stabilized approach gates should be observed and active communication calls made during each approach normal bracketing corrections in maintaining stabilized conditions occasionally involve momentary overshoots made necessary by atmospheric conditions such overshoots are acceptable frequent or sustained overshoots are not unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions requiring deviation from the above elements require

notes continuing past the related gate should only occur if meeting the objective of the next gate is achievable otherwise go around example if the is not con by ft it could continue if being fully stable by ft is achievable if the call at the respective gate indicates an undesired state con or that call should be repeated at an appropriate interval until the condition is corrected example repeated every ft stabilized approach and go decision guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind flight safety found guidelines for conducting stabilized approaches and achieving reliable go decision making why the change the current fsf guidelines were established in november and updated in analysis revealed that facets of that guidance are not optimal for effective deci making and that they may encourage go for approaches involving very low risk the overall goal is to improve go decision making in revising the stabilized approach guidelines four objectives must be met the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and management resulting in greater acceptance of the policy safety must be ensured during the approach by mitigating against the common types of alas energy short hard landing tail strike and runway excursions veer it must be ensured that the resulting go are con ducted for approaches of appropriate risk and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to go ma increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on atc the flight crew collective situational awareness must be improved through better communication flight crews indicated in the foundation project research that current guidelines on when go must be executed are not realistic for most real operational environments and approaches they described what realistic parameters look like from their perspective the criteria for which stable approach is defined can be grouped into three types of parameters flight path profile and lateral configuration gear and speed brakes and energy management of descent speed and thrust add to these the variable environmental conditions length and condition and weather and there are four groups of parameters to be considered when designing stable approach criteria approach gates we can address all stable approach parameters and ala safety issues at three procedural gates agl configuration gate from ft to ft depending on aircraft type agl stable gate and agl go gate the stable approach criteria are the same at each gate for ap conducted in both imc and vmc ft agl configuration gate previous guidance required that go must be con if the flight was not fully stable in imc with respect to the physics of go safety is the same in both imc and vmc in this context differentiation of go at feet in imc and at feet in vmc is not required the new functional significance of the mark is that it is the last suitable point along the approach to ensure that final landing configuration is selected and verified by the flight crew the flap and gear transition deceleration to final approach speed and thrust stabilization should occur before the aircraft reaches the next gate at ft agl it should be emphasized that initial configuration should occur before reaching the gate this gate is the last point at which final landing configuration should be selected and confirmed the gate is familiar demarcation to flight crews and is often accompanied by an automatically generated callout note that the gate may vary for air type and gross weight the operator should determine the appropriate height of the gate based on aircraft de cele ra characteristics and the manufacturer recommend the following discussion of aircraft energy management during approach is based on the fsf alar briefing notes safety foundation aircraft deceleration characteristics although deceleration characteristics largely depend on the aircraft type and gross weight the following typical values can be considered for quick assessment and management of aircraft deceleration capability deceleration on three glide path with landing flaps and gear down to kt per nm note three glide path is typically equivalent to descent gradient of or vertical speed for final approach groundspeed of kt example aircraft with final approach speed of kt would need to be at maximum speed of kt at the gate to be stable at ft using the median deceleration rate of kt per nm and descent rate of fpm kt nm kt gate does not address any particular ala type but serves to facilitate achieving fully stabilized approach at the next lower gate ft additionally it is in line with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project that aircraft configuration and aircraft energy management are two separate and distinct aspects of stabilized approach and the aircraft energy stabilization height can be lower than the aircraft configuration height although go may be considered at this gate not mandating go at this point reduces the overall number of potential go by allowing low unstable approaches to continue at safe altitude analysis is discussed in improved collective situational awareness at this gate is achieved through procedural active communication between flight crew agl gate previous guidance required that go must be conduct if the flight was not fully stable in vmc the revised guid retains the recommendation that the approach should be fully stable at this gate however the mandate to go around has been removed although go may be considered at this gate not mandating go reduces the overall number of potential go by allowing low unstable approaches to con while at safe altitude analysis is found in not mandating go at this gate also aligns with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project findings indicating go can still be executed safely even from lower altitudes when conditions are stable or have only minor deviations outside the stable approach definition as this makes operational sense to those who execute and manage the policy there is better likelihood of compliance the gate is suitable point in the approach for flight crew to verify all stable approach criteria it is familiar de mar for flight crews and is also often accompanied by an au generated callout being stable at this point in the approach allows for subsequent developing instabilities to be compared against state of constant energy reduction improved collective situational awareness at this gate is also achieved through procedural active communication between flight crew ft agl go gate this gate is new establishing this gate clearly marks the boundary between higher altitudes where stable approach is strongly recommended and the point where continuing an unstable descent reduces the margin of safety it differentiates between approach stability and go decision these are two distinct flight issues and from sy perspective they should remain distinct elements in decision making it should be understood that the agl value is not intended to be absolute it can be approximated to take ad of aircraft automatic callout systems for example consider an ils minimum set for ft agl some manuf ac automatic callout systems provide an alert ft above minimums so in such cases ft agl could be established as the go gate value and utilized in the auto callout in the active call procedures descending in an unstable state below the gate should be warning to flight crews that the level of risk is increasing and action is required whether the aircraft is unstable at this gate or becomes unstable below ft analyses indicate that flight crews who continue an unstable descent below ft do not recognize the need for increased concern or the need for go the awareness of the increased need for action can be improved by heightening the definition of the aircraft condition from being in an unstable condition to being in condition to go around this can prompt the flight crew to make the correct decision to go around martin smith of the pre group explains psychological tipping point is the moment of maximum situational awareness is when the flight crew is primed to pull the trigger on the go the subtle change to to go around is such primer in other words the to go around is permission to act per mis to comply drawing comparison to another industry initiative the pilot not flying is now known as the pm change that was intended to influence the mindset of the pm and also to alter his behavior in recognition of the importance of monitoring similar effect can be realized in identifying an unstable flight condition below ft as go condition condition that demands go decision to further emphasize the point the to win can be viewed as the stable approach zone with the focus on ensuring that the aircraft is fully stabilized the area from ft to thrust can be viewed as the primary go zone where the focus shifts from tabi liz the aircraft to going around using rejected takeoff below maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action to stop the airplane within the accelerate stop distance as an analogy rejected takeoff below kt is considered to occur in different regime speed compared with rejected takeoff above kt high regime here through training and guidance there is shift in psychology for pilots operating in the low vs high regime similar shift can be realized through the approach to landing lowering the go execution altitude reduces the overall number of potential go by allowing low approaches to continue while at higher safer alti it makes the stable approach and go policies more in line with flight crews psychological beliefs and more manageable by management prevents risk transfer from low risk unstable approaches to potentially higher go and limits unnecessary demands on the air traffic system if not fully stable at or below this gate the decision to go around should be made without hesitation go below ft is not necessarily unsafe this determination depends on the degree and type of approach instability and aircraft type and performance characteristics this gate is essentially the beginning of the primary go zone from ft to thrust reverser deployment at this gate the low ala is addressed the most common types of low energy alas are landing short hard landing and tail strike if we analyze the most extreme case of low energy it is one where thrust is at flight idle speed is ref and the descent rate is fpm double normal rate of descent federal aviation regulations part says the landing configuration the steady gradient climb may not be less than percent with the engines at the power or thrust that is available eight seconds after initialization of move of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight idle to go power setting and design and construction of the engine must enable an increase from the fixed minimum flight idle power from not more than percent of rated takeoff power or thrust available to percent in not less than five seconds the most limiting of these two regulations is the eight requirement in our extreme low case of descending at fpm using linear anal without taking into consideration lessening of the rate of descent as engines spool and achieving climb gradient the flight will descend ft figure per min ft another useful analysis comes from flight safety foundation alar tool kit which says that an aircraft being flown on go while on approach path with thrust at flight idle descending at fpm and with ref at minus kt will experience an altitude loss of approximately ft safety foundation if we more than double the rate of descent to fpm in this analysis the aircraft would ex an altitude loss of approximately feet alar tool kit figure it is also interesting to look at design specifications for taws such as egp ws the technical standard order for such systems requires that for the final approach segment descent warning be given in time to allow for obstacle clear altitude after recovery that includes one pilot response time and standard gravitational accel era pull of transportation faa the tso further describes the altitude loss of an aircraft de at fpm with response time of one second and pull as being ft and says the required warning should be given no later than ft above the obstacle tso figure in comparison with these analyses gate of ft agl to execute go provides adequate altitude margin for even the most extreme low unstable approach the margin in this case results in percent increase over the linear eight part determination percent increase over the fsf alar determination and percent increase over the taws determination although the number of approach and landing accidents is greater than the number of go accidents the go around phase of flight has more fatalities per accident by ensuring safe altitude of ft to conduct go in the extreme unstable low case and by allowing low unstable approaches to continue between ft and ft the potential number of go would be reduced lower the exposure to go risks comparisons of revised gates to industry monitoring and alerting systems and faa runway overrun

source flight safety foundation tcas to help flight crews make timely and consistent decisions the industry has developed few systems in the form of stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems for approach and landing energy management the airbus runway overrun protection system has number of alerting and monitoring functions but those that are pertinent to this analysis are the visual alert that begins at ft agl and the aural alert at ft agl rop does present evaluation of aircraft real energy and the runway distance available for landing and provides visual too short alert at ft and an aural alert at ft jacob because of the lower altitudes at which these alerts occur and considering the severity of the condition that is not enough runway to stop the aircraft go really is the only option except in the most dire emergencies when comparing this condition to the conditions being applied to the proposed stabilized approach and go guidelines the fsf guide are quite conservative honeywell smart landing system also has many alerting and monitoring functions including aural alerts beginning at ft agl and ending at ft agl with an unstable alert the criteria used by the system to make the alert are variable but based on monitoring excessive approach angle excessive speed and flap settings honeywell intern again the altitudes where these alerts are given are similar to those recommended in the stabilized ap and go guidelines achieving collective situational awareness through active communication this project found that situational awareness is lacking among most flight crews who continue an unstable descent and land unstable communication is vital in achieving high situational awareness two key types of communication are recommended for improvements approach and landing brief and active communication sops throughout the approach pre approach and landing briefings and pre briefings most airlines already have procedures for briefings which ad the most important aspects of the approach and landing detailed guidance is provided in fsf alar briefing note safety foundation alar task force the following guidance is not intended to replace those briefings but is an addition to current standard briefing guidance improve overall ala awareness and improve awareness of specific approach and landing risks as demonstrated in the project data simply knowing few overall statistics can raise situational awareness igni fi when company statistics are available they should be referenced however in their absence the following industry statistics can be used alas make up approximately percent of all accidents approximately percent of unstable approaches result in go and more than percent of runway excursions follow stable approach that becomes unstable after threshold crossing additionally reviewing the effects of runway contamination and tail winds on runway excursions is relevant because they contribute to significant number of runway excursions the flight safety foundation runway safety initiative found that about percent of runway landing excursions are veer off of that percentage percent follow stable approaches of all veer percent were associated with wind and percent with runway contamination the remaining per of runway landing excursions are overruns and of that group percent follow unstable approaches safety foundation this project found that awareness of instabilities is crit important in the landing phase as well as in the approach phase some simple rules of thumb regarding the effect of poor landing technique on landing distance can significantly improve situational awareness for example pilots should plan for landing distances to in by ft per second of floating ft per kt excess speed from ref on dry runway ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet runway and ft per ft excess above ft over runway threshold this also applies when the vertical guidance for the ap by design places the aircraft higher than ft agl when crossing the threshold landing distances are based on threshold crossing briefings including these statistics and rules of thumb should occur at intervals that will ensure that flight crews have an in depth awareness of the information for example bi briefings also should discuss any allowances for flight crews to adjust company policies discussion in safe landing guidelines as permitted by guided procedures in the policies themselves for example allowing crew to conduct touchdown beyond the normal approach and landing and pre briefing guidance pre briefing should include in addition to existing approach briefing components an emphasis on approach and landing threats when available company statistics should be used periodically bi the briefing should include approach and landing accident statistics overall statistics alas make up approximately percent of all accidents approximately percent of runway excursions develop from approaches that become unstable after threshold crossing and approximately percent of unstable approaches or unstable landings result in go runway excursion environmental contributors percent of landing excursions are veer with wind factor in percent and runway contam nation factor in percent about percent of veer follow stable approaches and percent of landing excursions are overruns of these percent follow unstable approaches landing distance increase rules of thumb ft per second of floating ft per kt excess speed from ref landing speed on dry runway ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet runway and ft per ft excess above ft over runway threshold for each approach briefing should include environmental ala threats contamination crosswind tail winds go readiness in addition to normal go briefing heightened readiness should be discussed in the event of poor environmental conditions and any adjustments to approach and landing policy requirements as permitted by written policy guidance landing beyond the normal touchdown zone if performance permits pre briefing at an appropriate low period just prior to commencing the approach crews should recap current environmental threats go readiness and any adjustments to go policy procedures source flight safety foundation touchdown zone as long as adequate landing performance and distance references exist finally as pre briefings often occur minutes or more before an approach the project findings and recommend suggest that short update or refreshment of the current threats and go readiness be briefed just prior to the ap during low period in the lower descent this can refresh and up flight crews situational awareness pre approach and landing and pre briefing guidance active communication throughout the approach this project determined that communication is one of the key attributes of effective collaborative decision making by flight crews by factor of approximately four flight crews who comply with their company go policy had comm uni about approach instabilities and for most crews who con an unstable approach and landing no one made the actual decision to continue that is there was no communication about the decision to continue it just happened the difficulty with passive calls which are made only if prob condition exists is that in their absence it is undetermined if the condition exists the call could be absent for several reasons as explained in the report findings active calls however force flight crews to speak discuss or express condition either positive or negative on every approach it is also important not to overload the flight crew with standard communication and to ensure that they have time to listen to atc and perform other tasks therefore active calls must be short and direct calls are usually initiated by the pm and responded to by the pf the pm call on the approach normally indicates condition and the response by the pf may either be an ac or directional response it is recommended that there be an active call at each ap gate if the active call indicates an undesired aircraft state the call should continue to be made periodically throughout the approach at intervals such as each ft or ft until the desired state is achieved or go is conducted this serves the same purpose as warning from egp ws or tcas active repetitive calls in the to zone also pre the pf for an eventual conclusion if the offending co ndi is not corrected that is go repetitive warning calls prime the pf anticipatory compensatory hierarch and relational awareness es as compared with common current procedures in which sudden single go around call is made at or ft which has lesser ef in primarily the hierarchical awareness the implementation of active calls should not imply that passive and communicative calls such as or be omitted passive calls remain an important component of situational awareness and should be used in combination with active calls as required the following are examples of active calls at approach gates during an approach if an airline has stable approach and monitoring system installed such as rop or smart landing the need for complete series of active calls throughout the approach and landing is largely removed these systems apply passive conditional calls however the nature of the automation provides form of reliability that passive calls from flight crews do not gate pm active call pf response ft agl con con or ft agl stabilized stabilized or ft agl stabilized around or to go around around agl above

touchdown aim point in reference to the available landing area as follows available landing area touchdown aim point touchdown aim point markings are white rectangular stripes one on each side of the runway centerline that begin at the distances indicated above the width of the aim markings varies with the width of the runway source flight safety foundation fsf safe landing guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind the revised flight safety foundation guidelines for safe landing and achieving reliable go decision making during the landing phase as with the stable approach and go decision guidelines there were several objectives namely that the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and manage to improve agreement with the policy ensure safety during landing by mitigating the common types of alas landing runway excursions and veer ensure the resultant go are in situations of ap risk and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to go maneuver increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on atc and improve the flight crew collective situational awareness the guidelines established here do not replace manufacturer limitations and procedural guidance or state regulations and guidance excursions that occur following an unstable approach are mitigated largely in the approach phase however they can still prevented in the landing phase additionally large numbers of excursions occur following stable approach that becomes unstable only after the aircraft passes the runway thresh guidelines in this section are targeted at these types of excursions landing excursions are of two types overruns in which aircraft run off the end of the runway surface and veer in which aircraft exit the side of the runway surface to address these types of alas we will enhance landing guidelines in four areas longitudinal limit awareness touchdown zone and distance lateral limit awareness centerline environmental variability and adjustments to established policies and situational awareness and communication project findings include that collective situational awareness is low during the landing phase and although most opera have policies defining where the touchdown should occur very few have guidance or sops on how to determine where the touchdown occurs or how and when to determine if go around should be executed for example most operators spec that the aircraft should touch down in the touchdown zone on the centerline however they do not train or specify how to determine if the aircraft has passed the dz who should make the determination or how much of deviation from the runway centerline is permissible before go should be conducted most pilots say either gut feeling or experience helps them judge when an aircraft has passed the acceptable limit even though they readily state that their experience does not include go from the landing phase the impact of improving collective situational awareness in the landing phase can be significant longitudinal limit awareness dz and distance touchdown zones vary in length with one determining factor being total runway length runways of ft and longer have touchdown zones ft long and runways of and longer have touchdown zones long relative positioning markings are present within the dz and are clearly identifiable on non runway the aiming point is the widest marking located at the distance from the threshold and distance from the threshold with the end of the dz being identified by the last marking at ft and approach alerting and monitoring systems such as smart provide aural alerts when an aircraft has passed company touchdown area when an aircraft passes this area without touching down an aural alert such as landing deep landing is given honeywell international sops then dictate go this objective warning immediately enhances crew awareness and leads to better decision making in the absence of such system the pm through sops can be directed to monitor the passing of dz markings and make an active call such as limit landing or of zone after passing the last marking indicating the passage of the dz in cases in which the runway is contaminated and markings are not visible couple of options exist if available runway remaining markers can be used or using the landing distance of thumb pilots can calculate that for an aircraft traveling ft per second the normal touchdown area of to ft will occur in four to eight seconds fps seconds to ft calculations also will show that the end of the dz will pass in approximately seconds ft fps seconds lateral limit awareness centerline most operators specify that the touchdown shall occur on the runway centerline but do not say how this will hap or who will determine when the aircraft is drifting as important as it is to have situational awareness regarding longitudinal limit it is equally important to understand lateral limits manufacturers often provide cockpit visual cues and techniques for determining where the main landing gear is in relation to the aircraft centerline as an example boeing says that for the the view through lower outboard corner of the pilot forward win to the ground is good visual reference for the outboard side of the main landing gear wheels on the same side the lower inboard corner of the pilot forward window is also good reference for the opposite side main gear wheels boeing company in the absence of other lateral limits maintaining the most outboard main landing gears on either side of the centerline is reasonable limit using visual cues as in the example above can help determine the positioning of the main landing gear this is considered rough operational guide with its own limitations however there are no known alternatives other than relying on sense the monitor of this positioning can be performed by the pm during the landing and if he or she sees that the position of the aircraft is incorrect he can make an appropriate call limit in that case sops would dictate go environmental variability and adjustments to established policies environmental variability can have significant effect on land performance and desired touchdown points operators should consider giving flight crews the tools and guidelines to determine when it makes sense to modify or adjust landing and go policies for safety and possibly operational efficiency it can be difficult for some operators to consider allowing crew to land beyond the dz however landing performance combined with sound guidance and policies for operating outside normal definitions makes sense when safe operations are assured over we also have the problem of rules with no room to apply judgment kern said in book of these policies begin with good intent but inside the good intent we create systems that defy logic and poison the well of fairness which often results in an unintended consequence loss of faith in the system of rules problems can develop when environmental conditions are such that operating outside established policies makes sense but there are no guiding principles on how to accomplish this for example an aircraft landing on run requires landing distance although the company policy states that go should be initiated if touchdown does not occur inside the dz is it the best course of action as opposed to an option of extending the touchdown point to ft km for example certainly the answer is yes if the mark is not definable however if the flight crew can identify this point and if they have briefed the revision to the policy is it still the best course of action to go around in this case the transfer of risk to go is questionable revised touchdown point can be determined by citing known distance point along the runway taxi marking runway distance marker or time period one second approximates ft in distance in another case in which weather and runway conditions demand that touchdown occur before the end of the dz guid should give crews the methods and means to identify the shorter touchdown limit for example if the crew wants to be touching down within ft of the runway thresh they need references to determine where this will occur using dz markings or time lapse seconds from the time the aircraft crosses the threshold in any case written policies and guidance must be in place to give the flight crew permission procedures and techniques to modify landing point limit this should be briefed and agreed upon by all crew figure approach and landing gates and active calls end of dz of zone of zone deep landing window stabilized go window stabilized not stabilized window con not con dz touchdown zone calls can be substituted with auto callout such as minimums above source flight safety foundation situational awareness and communication figure shows examples of new active com munic calls recommended in the landing phase of flight in the case of exceeding centerline touchdown limit it is difficult to define point in the dz where positive centerline active call can be made although not ideal in this case the use of passive call may be more operational that is the call is made only when the drift limit is reached note that stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems accomplish the objectives of some active calls therefore flight crew calls would not be required

being repaved and grounding points are not being re installed in recent years there has been change in philosophy and practice with regard to grounding in the edition of the national fire protection association standard for aircraft fuel servicing the requirements for ground ing were deleted and requirements for bonding were clarified the practice in the united states has been to bond and ground but tests have proven that if the aircraft and fuel truck are properly bonded grounding wire carries no electrical charge at all this is why nfpa no longer specifies grounding for safety during aircraft fueling the nfpa determination was based on the following points grounding does not prevent sparking at the fuel surface grounding is not required per nfpa recommended practice on static electricity static electrical grounding points can have high resistance making them unsuitable for grounding the wire used for grounding might not be capable of conducting current in the event of an electrical fault in the ground support equipment connected to the aircraft and could become an ignition source if the wire fuses the gulf stream ground handling and servicing handbooks and aircraft

has been brought to our attention by aircraft operator with the aircraft powered down and the battery ci cuit breaker closed depressing one of the entry light switches causes the controller to power up on aircraft atte ry power initiate minute countdown timer and turn on the associated light within the aircraft the deviation between the electrical drawing note and actual op ration comes about as result of the length of time that the switch is depressed the entry light switches are momentary switches that complete the circuit as long as the switch is depressed momentary tap second on one of the entry light switches completes the circuit long enough for the controller to recognize the request to power up in battery mode however by the time the operating system and application software are both running the active low signal through that entry light switch is no longer present result in in case where the countdown timer and location breakfast minutes november light are unable to turn on as both of these functions are controlled from within the application software troubleshooting revealed that if the initial switch press lasts for three to four seconds there is sufficient time for

countdown timer and determ inin which light switch was depressed to close the appropriate contact that turns the light on altern ative ly if the controller is powered up with the momentary press on the entry light switch and is fo lowed up with second pr ess couple of seconds later that the application software is running the countdown timer is initiated and the corresponding light is turned on the resulting action of single momentary tap of an entry light switch is the controller would be powered up on the battery without the count down timer being initiated that would eventually turn it

This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix\\nBe sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach\\nFAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed:\\n1.

Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References\\nFAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA:\\nThe approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable\\nThe threshold\\nThe threshold markings\\nThe visual approach slope indicator\\nThe threshold lights\\nThe runway end identifier lights (REIL)\\nThe touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings\\nThe touchdown zone lights\\nThe runway or runway markings\\nThe runway lights\\nBasic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting\\n6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible\\nFull scale needle deflection past the final approach fix\\nNavigation equipment required for the approach fails\\nATC instructs you to go missed\\nUnsafe runway\\nTraffic\\nController or pilot navigation errors\\nWeather – e.g., thunderstorm cell\\nWhen the aircraft is being operated below MDA – loss of visual references\\nIf your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions\\nIf ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure\\nA controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions\\nVerbal Missed Approach Instructions\\nATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach\\nATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required\\nATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency]. Be advised [Traffic...]“\\nIf executing instructions different from those on the procedure as dictated by approach, call “on the go\" or \"executing climb out\" to reduce confusion\\n9Missed Approach Chart SymbolsTo provide ready missed approach guidance, approach plates use quick reference icons\\nDue to limited space only four or less icons can be shown. Hence the icons may not show the entire missed approach procedure\\nThe full missed approach instructions are provided textually at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing10JEPP Missed Approach Chart Symbols11NACO Missed Approach Chart Symbols12Climb to altitudeTurn to specified headingTo Specified fixTrack RadialMissed Approach Point LocationThe missed approach point (MAP) on a non-precision approach is\\u2009not designed with any consideration to where the\\u2009aircraft must begin descent to execute a safe landing\\nIt is developed based on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and possibly air traffic considerations\\nDescent below the MDA, including during the missed approach, is not authorized\\nThe Decision Altitude (DA) is an altitude derived location where a missed approach will be initiated on a precision approach\\nObstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach\\nDecision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). 13Obstacle Protection Obstacle protection is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the DA/H or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA)\\nA climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart\\nWhen higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix\\nPreplan your approach to ensure you can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile) \\nHigher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute)\\nTables for climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are on page D1 of U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets\\nFormula: Required Climb Per Minute = ((_[climb gradient]_ ft/nautical mile) x ([ground speed] nautical miles/hour)/60) = 36,000 feet per hour = 14Beginning the Procedure Other Than at the MAP/DHIn the design of the missed approach procedure no consideration is given to an abnormally early missed approach turn from the approach course\\nWhen an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC, \\nFly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point \\nRemain at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver\\nCan begin climb early, absent altitude restrictions\\nThink CFIT when making an early missed!!15Circling Approach MAPExecuting the missed approach after starting the circling maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP\\nThe missed approach is executed for the runway the approach started on, not the runway you were circling to\\nThe initial turn on a missed approach will always be towards the landing runway until established on a segment of the missed approach\\nAlways think about how to execute the missed approach while circling so it is not a surprise if you enter IMC as aircraft is clear of obstacles only when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area16Since the circling missed approach maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost.Flying the Missed ApproachBefore the FAF \\nMemorize initial altitudes and headings\\nSet up No. 2 Nav if possible for missed approach initial navaid course17Flying the Missed Approach\\nInitial Missed Approach Segment ProcedureAt the MAP / DA\\nAdd climb power\\nRotate gradually (on-speed) to Vx\\nCheck for positive rate of climb\\nClean up the aircraft – gear and flaps up in the order specified by the POH\\nClimb out at appropriate speed18CommunicateUpon execution of a missed approach and becoming stabilized in climb notify ATC\\nIf communicating with the Tower -

The NOTAM will specify both the textual instructions and any additional equipment requirements necessary to complete the procedure\\nYou may reject an ATC clearance for an alternate missed approach that requires equipment not necessary for the published approach procedure when the alternate missed approach is issued after beginning the approach\\nHowever, if the alternate missed approach is issued prior to beginning the approach the pilot must either accept the entire procedure (including the alternate missed approach) or request a different approach procedure22G1000 Missed ApproachAt the MAP, “SUSP” is displayed in the HSI and directly above the SUSP softkey\\nAutomatic sequencing of approach waypoints is suspended at the MAP\\nA “FROM” indication is displayed on the CDI, but the course guidance is simply an extension of the final approach course \\nDo NOT follow this extended course\\nWhen the message “RAIM is not available” is displayed in the Alerts Window on the PFD a missed approach must also be executed23G1000 Missed ApproachFlying the Missed\\nInitiate the missed approach sequence by following the missed approach procedures as published / directed by ATC, for proper climb and heading instructions\\nIf not already using GPS as nav source, press the CDI softkey to switch external CDI output to GPS for guidance. \\nPress the SUSP softkey to return to automatic sequencing of waypoints\\nIf there is a missed approach course from a fix to altitude, Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey\\nUpon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to resume automatic leg sequencing\\nAfter pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD\\nThe G1000 will guide to the missed approach holding point and a recommended entry procedures for the holding pattern will be shown24G1000 Missed ApproachNote that the G1000 at the holding point again displays “SUSP” above the SUSP softkey.

The brain incorrectly resolves the two forces as a single pitch-up movement\\nWhen that occurs, the pilot feels as though the aircraft is climbing or that the nose is pitching up, when, in fact, it remains in level flight.  \\nThe normal reaction, absent visual clues, to the pitch-up illusion is to push forward on the stick with the risk of ground contact in a missed approach28Common ErrorsFailure to have essential knowledge of the information on the approach chart\\nFailure to have initial steps of missed approach committed to memory\\nFailure to identify DH or MAP or other condition requiring a missed approach\\nIncorrect communication procedures \\nNoncompliance with ATC clearances, the published missed approach or an ATC instruction or failure to notify ATC of inability to comply\\nFailure to accomplish checklist items\\nFaulty basic instrument flying techniques\\nFailure to accomplished a missed approach timely – e.g. motoring on to look for references29PTS Standards\\nArea of Operation VI.

', ' The Missed Approach – Hey Where’s the Runway?1Missed Approach SegmentA Missed approach is a procedure used when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing The Missed Approach Segment is that part of an instrument approach procedure between the missed approach point (MAP), the missed approach way-point (MAWP), or the point of arrival at the decision height and the specified missed approach NAVAID (navigational aid), intersection, fix, or waypoint, as appropriate, at the minimum IFR altitude It is in this part of the approach procedure that the aircraft will climb and return to the en route structure or is positioned for holding or subsequent approach The missed approach route and altitudes are shown on the instrument approach charts2The Missed ApproachThe missed approach is one of the most difficult and critical phases of an instrument approach and is the one practiced the least High workload, as the configuration of the aircraft must be changed (approach to climb out), coupled with new navigation route/Navaids An approach in actual conditions should be flown with the anticipation that the missed approach is an anticipated outcome The missed approach procedure typically includes an initial heading or track to follow, and an altitude to climb to.  This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix Be sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach FAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed: 1.  Whenever: Flight visibility is less than the specified visibility for the approach If required visual references are not seen at either of the following times:  When the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or Upon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DA/DH where a DA/DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that until touchdown. 2.  Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References FAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA: The approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable The threshold The threshold markings The visual approach slope indicator The threshold lights The runway end identifier lights (REIL) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings The touchdown zone lights The runway or runway markings The runway lights Basic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting 6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible Full scale needle deflection past the final approach fix Navigation equipment required for the approach fails ATC instructs you to go missed Unsafe runway Traffic Controller or pilot navigation errors Weather – e.g., thunderstorm cell When the aircraft is being operated below MDA – loss of visual references If your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure A controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions Verbal Missed Approach Instructions ATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach ATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required ATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency]. Be advised [Traffic...]“ If executing instructions different from those on the procedure as dictated by approach, call “on the go\" or \"executing climb out\" to reduce confusion 9Missed Approach Chart SymbolsTo provide ready missed approach guidance, approach plates use quick reference icons Due to limited space only four or less icons can be shown. Hence the icons may not show the entire missed approach procedure The full missed approach instructions are provided textually at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing10JEPP Missed Approach Chart Symbols11NACO Missed Approach Chart Symbols12Climb to altitudeTurn to specified headingTo Specified fixTrack RadialMissed Approach Point LocationThe missed approach point (MAP) on a non-precision approach is\\u2009not designed with any consideration to where the\\u2009aircraft must begin descent to execute a safe landing It is developed based on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and possibly air traffic considerations Descent below the MDA, including during the missed approach, is not authorized The Decision Altitude (DA) is an altitude derived location where a missed approach will be initiated on a precision approach Obstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach Decision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). 13Obstacle Protection Obstacle protection is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the DA/H or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA) A climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart When higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix Preplan your approach to ensure you can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile)  Higher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute) Tables for climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are on page D1 of U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets Formula: Required Climb Per Minute = ((_[climb gradient]_ ft/nautical mile) x ([ground speed] nautical miles/hour)/60) = 36,000 feet per hour = 14Beginning the Procedure Other Than at the MAP/DHIn the design of the missed approach procedure no consideration is given to an abnormally early missed approach turn from the approach course When an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC,  Fly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point  Remain at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver Can begin climb early, absent altitude restrictions Think CFIT when making an early missed!!15Circling Approach MAPExecuting the missed approach after starting the circling maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP The missed approach is executed for the runway the approach started on, not the runway you were circling to The initial turn on a missed approach will always be towards the landing runway until established on a segment of the missed approach Always think about how to execute the missed approach while circling so it is not a surprise if you enter IMC as aircraft is clear of obstacles only when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area16Since the circling missed approach maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost.Flying the Missed ApproachBefore the FAF  Memorize initial altitudes and headings Set up No. 2 Nav if possible for missed approach initial navaid course17Flying the Missed Approach Initial Missed Approach Segment ProcedureAt the MAP / DA Add climb power Rotate gradually (on-speed) to Vx Check for positive rate of climb Clean up the aircraft – gear and flaps up in the order specified by the POH Climb out at appropriate speed18CommunicateUpon execution of a missed approach and becoming stabilized in climb notify ATC If communicating with the Tower - \"[Place] tower, [Callsign], missed approach [Reason]\" If communicating with approach - \"[Place] approach, [Callsign] missed approach off of [Location] climbing through [Altitude] for [Altitude] with request\"19Lost Communications Missed ApproachIf communications are lost during the approach and you take a missed approach: Squawk 7600 Follow the published missed approach instructions to ensure adequate obstruction clearance Route: Proceed to the alternate IAF as filed and commence an approach Altitude: The EXPECTED altitude, if given one, after filing a “DRAFT” or; Your option of the highest of the two emergency safe altitudes depicted on the destination and alternate approach procedure charts if fields are within 200 NM of each other or At flight level 18,000\\' If destination altimeter is 29.92 inches or higher, fly FL180 If destination altimeter is less than 29.92, fly FL190 \"DRAFT\": Short flight plan including - a) Destination; b) Route; c) Altitude; d) Fuel State and e) Time En-route20NOW WHATDecide what your course of action will be Repeat the same approach at the same airport Another approach at the same airport Divert to planned alternate Divert elsewhere Hold for conditions to improve Consider fuel load and distance / time to a good alternate Inform ATC of your desires21Alternate Missed ApproachSome locations may have a preplanned alternate missed approach procedure for use in the event the primary NAVAID used for the missed approach procedure is out of service To avoid confusion, the alternate missed approach instructions are not published on the chart However, the alternate missed approach holding pattern will be depicted on the instrument approach chart  When the alternate missed approach procedure is implemented by NOTAM, it becomes a mandatory part of the procedure. The NOTAM will specify both the textual instructions and any additional equipment requirements necessary to complete the procedure You may reject an ATC clearance for an alternate missed approach that requires equipment not necessary for the published approach procedure when the alternate missed approach is issued after beginning the approach However, if the alternate missed approach is issued prior to beginning the approach the pilot must either accept the entire procedure (including the alternate missed approach) or request a different approach procedure22G1000 Missed ApproachAt the MAP, “SUSP” is displayed in the HSI and directly above the SUSP softkey Automatic sequencing of approach waypoints is suspended at the MAP A “FROM” indication is displayed on the CDI, but the course guidance is simply an extension of the final approach course  Do NOT follow this extended course When the message “RAIM is not available” is displayed in the Alerts Window on the PFD a missed approach must also be executed23G1000 Missed ApproachFlying the Missed Initiate the missed approach sequence by following the missed approach procedures as published / directed by ATC, for proper climb and heading instructions If not already using GPS as nav source, press the CDI softkey to switch external CDI output to GPS for guidance.  Press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic sequencing of waypoints If there is a missed approach course from a fix to altitude, Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to resume automatic leg sequencing After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD The G1000 will guide to the missed approach holding point and a recommended entry procedures for the holding pattern will be shown24G1000 Missed ApproachNote that the G1000 at the holding point again displays “SUSP” above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern The G1000 provides course guidance only on the inbound side of the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern to re-fly the approach, press the PROC key to “Select Approach” or “Activate Approach” (or use the Direct-To key to select another destination)  25G1000 Missed Approach Example Missed Approach Course From Fix To AltitudeAfter pressing the SUSP softkey, the missed approach sequence is automatically started with the course from fix to altitude leg After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey -  The G1000 returns to suspend mode when flying a course from a fix to altitude leg and indicates that automatic leg sequencing is suspended Fly the outbound course keeping the CDI needle centered. The Navigation Map Page depicts the flight path extending indefinitely from the Navfix. The distance increases and indicates the distance back to the Navaid Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic leg sequencing. Confirm that ‘SUSP’ no longer is displayed directly above the SUSP softkey The message “NEXT DTK 123” is the displayed, providing guidance to the holding fix. The actual desired track (DTK) depends on the ground speed and distance from the Navaid. Intercept and fly the inbound course, keeping the CDI needle centered As the plane approaches the Navaid (the missed approach holding point), a message in the navigation status bar recommends the holding pattern entry, e.g., “HOLD PARALLEL” Note that the G1000 again displays ‘SUSP’ above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern, press the PROC key to reactivate the approach or select a different approach, or press the Direct-To key to select another destination26G1000 Missed Approach Additional AutomationGA Switch (Go-Around)  Disengages the autopilot Selects the flight director Go-Around Mode, and  Activates the missed approach The GA Switch is located on the instrument panel above the throttle TOGA (Takeoff/Go-Around) Switch Offers automated go-arounds At the MAP, press the TOGA button Keeps the AP engaged Commands a climb Sets Autopilot to NAV mode and  Sequences to the missed approach 27Pitch-up IllusionPitch-up illusion is a significant hazard during the transition to climb out On approach the portion of the inner ear that provides sensory information related to acceleration—provides the sensation of stabilized speed, based primarily on the forces of gravity When acceleration and climb occur simultaneously as during the initial segment of a missed approach, two forces come together - gravity and acceleration The brain resolves the two forces (gravity and acceleration) as a single resultant force acting downward and backward. The brain incorrectly resolves the two forces as a single pitch-up movement When that occurs, the pilot feels as though the aircraft is climbing or that the nose is pitching up, when, in fact, it remains in level flight.   The normal reaction, absent visual clues, to the pitch-up illusion is to push forward on the stick with the risk of ground contact in a missed approach28Common ErrorsFailure to have essential knowledge of the information on the approach chart Failure to have initial steps of missed approach committed to memory Failure to identify DH or MAP or other condition requiring a missed approach Incorrect communication procedures  Noncompliance with ATC clearances, the published missed approach or an ATC instruction or failure to notify ATC of inability to comply Failure to accomplish checklist items Faulty basic instrument flying techniques Failure to accomplished a missed approach timely – e.g. motoring on to look for references29PTS Standards Area of Operation VI. C.Executes the missed approach procedure when the required visual references for the intended runway are not distinctly visible and identifiable: Non-Precision Approach – at the MAP Precision Approach - at Decision Altitude 30PTS Standards Area of Operation VI. C.Adequate knowledge of the missed approach procedure elements for standard approaches Initiates the missed approach promptly by applying power, establishing a climb attitude, and reducing drag in accordance with the aircraft manufacturer’s recommendations Reports beginning the missed approach procedure to ATC Complies with the published or alternate missed approach procedure Advises ATC or examiner anytime that the aircraft is unable to comply with a clearance, restriction, or climb gradient Follows the recommended checklist items appropriate to the go-around procedure Requests, if appropriate, ATC clearance to the alternate airport, clearance limit, or as directed by the examiner Maintains the recommended airspeed within ±10 knots; heading, course, or bearing within ±10°; and altitude(s) within ±100 feet during the missed approach procedure. Uses MFD and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position and track to help navigate the missed approach. Demonstrates an appropriate level of single-pilot resource management skills.31Questions32DisclaimerInstrument flight can be dangerous.

It’s European equivalent is ED-12B. A document that addresses the life process of developing embedded software in aircraft systems. It is a commonly accepted standard worldwide for regulating safety in the integration of software in aircraft systems.History of DO-178BSoftware in avionics has been around since the 1970’s By adding software to a system, certification becomes more complex. The RTCA creates DO-178 in 1980, while EUROCEA works on ED-35. The merged result is DO-178 / ED-12: the first common certification criteria for production of avionics software.Evolution of DO-178BIn 1985, revisions and updates were made to produce DO-178A / ED-12A. The documents became a worldwide basis for software certification in the aviation industry. DO-178B / ED-12B started in 1989 and finalized in 1992.DO-178B Document LayoutFigure 1-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”DO-178B Software LevelsDO-178B requires that all system requirements be mapped to one of the five software levels.  Level A - most critical failure level.  Failure at Level A results in catastrophic failure conditions for an aircraft.  Level B - the software at this level contributes to severe-major failure conditions.  Level C - software at this level contributes to major failure conditions.  Level D - software at this level contributes to minor failure conditions.  Level E - the software has no effect toward potential failure conditions.DO-178B Processes and OutputsDO-178B is divided into five main processes: Software Planning Software Development Software Verification Software Configuration Management Software Quality Assurance Each process has a set of expected documented outputs.Software Planning ProcessPurpose is to determine what will be done to produce safe, requirements-based software. Expected outputs: Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC) Software Development Plan Software Verification Plan Software Configuration Management Plan Software Quality Assurance PlanSoftware Development ProcessThe software development process is broken into four sub-processes: Software Requirements Process High-level requirements in relation to function, performance, interface and safety. Software Design Process Low-level requirements used to implement the source code. Software Coding Process Production of source-code from the design process. Integration Process Integration of code into a real-time environment.Software Development Process Continued…The following tangible outputs are the result of the combined four sub-processes: Software requirements data (SRD)  Software design description (SDD)  Source code  Executable object codeSoftware Verification ProcessThe purpose is to identify and report any errors resulting from the development process. The verification process objectives can be met with reviews, walkthroughs, unit testing, integration testing, and more. Proof of objectives is within the execution of the testing procedures. Outputs include: Software Verification Cases and Procedures Software Verification ResultsSoftware Verification Process Continued…Figure 6-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”Software Configuration Management ProcessThe purpose is to establish secure and effective configuration control for all artifacts. The following activities are done within the process: Configuration Identification Change Control Baseline establishment Archiving of the software Outputs include: Software Configuration Index, and Software Life Cycle Environment Configuration Index.Software Configuration Management Process (Continued…)Figure 7-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”Software Quality Assurance ProcessThe purpose is to provide assurance that the software life cycle process is going to yield quality software. Each process is analyzed to show that each process is producing the expected outputs. Any changes from originally proposed plans are reported, evaluated, and resolved to ensure process integrity.DO-178B Processes: ReviewDO-178B software life-cycle process is divided into five main processes: Software Planning Software Development Software Verification Software Configuration Management Software Quality Assurance The objective-based approach of DO-178B makes it flexible to individual projects.DO-178B CertificationD0-178B very specifically addresses the following which directly affects product development. Certification of a product applies only to it\\'s finished result. Certification includes approval of all systems and subsystems, hardware, software, firmware, development tools, production, and testing of the product. Certification is done on the individual application of the product Coding practices must be certified to ensure things like \"dead code\" are not allowed. Certification requires that \\'full testing\\' of the system and all of it\\'s components (including firmware) be done on the target platform in the target environment. Certification requires code testing at the MCDC level.The Future of DO-178CThe evolution of avionics software has forced a change upon the certification process. DO-178B was written absently in mind of older software tools. Advanced technologies and the growing complexities of newer avionics software needs to be addressed.The Future of DO-178CA committee has formed on behalf of the two major contributors (RTCA and EUROCAE) to produce DO-178C / ED-12C. Work has been started as of March 2005 and looks to be finished and published in December 2008. The document looks to tackle the introduction of new software development techniques among other things. I’m sure we’re all looking forward to it.References and Works CitedAvista Incorporated®, “DO-178B Basic Overview.” 7 July 2004.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The boundaries of the flight envelope will be defined within this document. All speeds are calibrated airspeeds (CAS) (requirement 4.4 ) and given in knots if not stated otherwise. All other units used are metric (SI units). The weights are given in mass units (kg) but the formulas require force units as input, therefore these are calculated in place wherever they are used. Note: The speeds defined within this document should be used for the placards, speed markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by flight test.

Maximum speed in level flight VH According to flight tests  at maximum weight and maximum continuous power at sea level conditions, the maximum speed in level flight has been determined:  Stall speeds VS, VS0, VS1 These speeds will be verified by flight test according to requirement 4.4.1 .  In order to calculate the stall speed, the maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane as a whole is determined first. The maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane has been calculated starting from the polar curve of the wing profile taken form ref.  (p. 236, Re=2.9E6 flaps retracted  and p.237,  for the flaps in landing configuration, and  in take-off configuration). Considering the horizontal tail balancing force and the lower total wing lift due to wing lift distribution, the total aeroplane lift coefficient has been lowered by 15% with respect to the one of the profile.   Therefore aeroplane lift coefficient is estimated to   and for the landing configuration (since the span extension of the flaps is half of the span of the wing):  Stall speeds have been calculated based on these calculated lift coefficients. The wetted wing area SW is used instead of total wing area S because of a lower lift within the fuselage section of the span. Flaps retracted (take-off configuration):  Flaps extended (landing configuration):  Flaps extended (take-off configuration):  With . The stall speed in landing configuration (flaps fully extended to 40 degrees) is 44 kts. Therefore it is In accordance with CS-LSA.5 . In Take-Off configuration (flaps extended to 20 degrees) the stall speed is 47 kts. (Note: These speeds are estimates. The methods for the estimation can be various. It is important that these estimations are as precise as possible. Flight tests will be used to validate the stall speeds. In case the flight tests show different values, this might have an impact on the speeds used for design and ultimately might impair the compliance to the CS-LSA.5.)  Design manoeuvring speed VA According to requirement 5.2.4.1     Flaps maximum operating speed VF According to requirement 5.2.4.2 , such speed shall be not less than the greater of      and   The speed has been selected as:            This is the maximum flap operating speed for the take-off (at 20 degrees) and landing flap settings at 40 degrees. Flaps maximum extension speed VFE On this aeroplane the maximum flap extension speed is identical to the flap operating speed VF.  This speed is the maximum speed for flaps in take-off and landing configuration. Design cruising speed VC According to requirement 5.2.4.3    may not be less than:  and need not be greater than:  The speed has been selected as:  (Note:  can be selected to be higher than  .) (Note:  and VDF ,VD ,VNE correlate with each other. should be selected to allow for a minimum margin of 22% to VDF in order to be able to satisfy the requirements for the next subchapters.) Design dive speed VD According to requirement 5.2.4.4   For  a higher value than the one above has been chosen:  (Note: ASTM F2245-12d 5.2.4.4  requires an exact value for the dive speed. Indeed, such value should be understood as a minimum value. This will be clarified in the next amendment of the CS-LSA.)  Demonstrated dive speed VDF According to requirement 4.1.1.1  VDF must be less than or equal to VD. In this case VDF is equal to VD:  (Note: In case the demonstrated VDF is lower than VD then VNE needs to be limited accordingly which could have an impact on the selection of VC as well.) Never exceed speed VNE According to requirement 4.1.1.2  the VNE Shall be greater than or equal to:  and  must be less than or equal to:  The speed has been selected as:  Note: If the aircraft is equipped with retractable landing gear then VLO must be determined as well (CS-LSA.15 6.12.2). Altitude The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. In fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)  Manoeuvring and Gust load factors n Summary of limit load factors according to certification specifications and gust requirements. Table 2 – Manoeuvring limit load factors  Gust envelope Gust load factors need to be considered because they can exceed the prescribed maximum load factors at different weights and altitudes. Since gust loads depend on air density and aircraft mass they will be calculated for all twelve cases (sea level and 10000ft=FL100, maximum, minimum flying weight and minimum flying weight with full wing fuel tanks) according to requirement 5.2.3.3  with flaps retracted (requirement 5.2.6.1 ) and fully extended (requirement 5.2.6.2 ) at . The calculation is based on appendix X3 . To calculate the gust loads at altitudes other than at sea level the formula X3.1  is altered to include the density at sea level  as well:  The corresponding weights are defined within . Since the gust loads on the wing and tail have been chosen to be treated together,  is the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane (). (Note: the applicant should provide the method for the calculation of the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane)  Table 3 – Gust load factors V-n Envelope Below a typical flight envelope is shown. This specific one is corresponding to MTOW and FL100. For other design weights the shape of the envelope remains similar, with the difference that the gust lines will change (due to different load factors as per Table 3).

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. Within this document the loads on the wings are determined throughout the whole flight envelope  and for the design weights as determined in  under all loading conditions. The simplified criteria of requirement X.1  have not been used for these calculations. The Loads are calculated using literature methods taken from the documents referenced in chapter 1. The following assumptions are made: Applicable to LSA only; no compressibility effects; conventional configuration (e.g. no tandem aircraft, bi-plane or canard); no pitching moment of the horizontal tail (symmetrical profile); no winglets, no wing tip tanks; no sweep, straight leading edge, no twist, constant profile, no dihedral; effect of the wing deformation on the loads not considered; no spoilers or airbrakes; landing gear attached to fuselage;  no wing struts (cantilever wing);     References List of Abbreviations CG centre of gravity LE leading edge ISA international standard atmosphere by International Organisation for Standardisation  KEAS knots equivalent airspeed MAC mean aerodynamic chord MTOW maximum take-off weight SI international system of units  angle of attack of the wing [deg]  local angle of attack of the station i [deg]  wing zero lift angle of attack [deg]  profile zero lift angle of attack [deg] a lift curve slope [1/deg] AR wing aspect ratio calculated by  [] b wing span [m]  average wing span at station i (mid span position of station) [m]  wing span position of MAC [m]  average fuselage width at wing section [m]  maximum fuselage width (equals ) [m]  local angle between resulting force and normal force at station [deg]  average chord at station i [m]  mean aerodynamic chord [m]  chord at wing root  [m]  chord at wing tip [m]  shear axis relative position as a fraction of local wing chord []  drag coefficient  []  lift coefficient  []  fuselage pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift profile pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient [] D drag force on the wings [N] d span wise drag line loading []  wing sweep of the quarter chord line [deg]  g gravity acceleration [m/s2]  fuselage moment factor []  total wing lift force (on both wings) [N]  local lift at station i [N]  lift line loading on the wing [N/m]  total horizontal tail lift force [N]  total fuselage length [m]  fuselage length in front of wing quarter mean aerodynamic chord point [m]  taper ratio (equals  ) []  wing pitching moment with lift acting on its aerodynamic centre [N]  moments around y axis [Nm]  normal force [N] n load factor [] num total number of stations of a single wing; num = 10 []   density of ambient air at a specific altitude []  running horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  incremental horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  running vertical shear force at station I (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  incremental vertical shear force at station i (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  local resulting force at station i [N] S wing area (not including wing carry-through) []  local tangential force at station i [N]  total torsion around elastic axis of the wing (at wing root) [mN]  local torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  incremental torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  dynamic viscosity (for Reynolds number) [] v airspeed [m/s] W total aircraft weight [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload)  [kg/m2]  total weight of a single wing (with no fuel or payload) [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload) [kg/m2] x longitudinal axis of the aircraft [m] distance to HT quarter chord line from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to aircraft centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to fuel centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE at station i [m]   aerodynamic centre shift due to fuselage pitching moment [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing-fuselage combination with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing fuselage combination from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord)  [m]    shear axis of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m] y lateral axis of the aircraft (span wise direction) [m]  average wing span position at station i [m]  spanwise width of station i [m] z vertical axis of the aircraft [m]  Throughout this document SI-units are used with speeds expected as m/s and angles in degrees if not stated otherwise. Requirements This document covers the following certification specifications requirements: Table 1 – Requirements   Input data The values shown below are derived from design data or other compliance documents for this particular aeroplane.   Load Calculation  The following steps have been followed: Load cases: First, the load cases have been identified in, in terms of weight, centre of gravity, speed, load factor, flap/aileron position, Altitude.  External Loads on the wing: for all load cases, the loads on the wing are calculated; Internal Loads in the wing: for the same load cases the internal loads in the wing (shear, bending moment, torsion) are calculated considering also the effect of the inertia of the wing;  Load cases Table 3 comprises all load cases corresponding to the points of the flight envelope  and design weights and centres of gravity .  Important:  Loads corresponding to flap deflected are considered not critical for the wing and will not be calculated in this document (flap loads will be calculated instead for the flap verification). Loads corresponding to landing conditions are considered not critical for the wing (since the landing gear is attached to the fuselage and no tip tanks or other large masses under the wing) and will not be calculated in this document. For the gust load calculations the wing and horizontal tail are treated together according to X3.1 in ref. . The resulting gust load accelerations are therefore calculated using the slope of the lift curve of the aeroplane (see also ) and treated as balanced flight conditions within this document.  Note: These assumptions have been considered realistic for this aeroplane but they are not of generic validity. It is the responsibility of the applicant to define the set of assumptions which can be acceptable for the particular aeroplane.   Altitude: The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. in fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)    Figure 1 – Reference flight envelope (WMTOW, FL 100) Table 2 – Design weights (explained in ref. ) Table 3 – Load cases Note: For this revision of this example document, asymmetric load cases have not been calculated. Loads on the aeroplane Reference axes and sign convention  Figure 2 – Aeroplane reference axes The origin is located at the airplane axis of symmetry (x axis) with the y axis passing through the leading edge of the mean aerodynamic chord section of the wing. Symmetrical flight conditions The loads on the wing structure arising from symmetrical flight manoeuvres according to requirements 5.2.2 and 5.2.3  are determined within this chapter.  The following abbreviations are used within this chapter (all measurements with respect to wing leading edge at wing mean aerodynamic chord, forces acting according to arrows are positive) x longitudinal axis of the aircraft z vertical axis of the aircraft CG aircraft centre of gravity HT horizontal tail L lift force on the wings  horizontal tail balancing force (HT lift force)  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient (lift force assumed to act on  )  total pitching moment (must be zero for equilibrium) n W aircraft total weight force (= m*n*g )  distance to HT quarter chord line (of HT MAC as quarter chord line)  distance to aircraft centre of gravity  distance to wing fuselage combination centre of pressure   (lift force acting on not generating any pitching moment)  distance to wing fuselage combination aerodynamic centre   (lift force acting on generating constant pitching moment ) The external forces and moments acting on the aeroplane in a balanced flight condition have been determined. The\\xa0simplified scheme in Figure 3 is considered. The aeroplane is reduced to the wing and the Horizontal tail.  Figure 3 – Aeroplane simplified scheme The following forces are considered and placed in equilibrium:  Lift on the wing; Horizontal tail balancing load according to requirement 5.2.2.1 ; Weight of the aeroplane; For the calculation of the equilibrium, the z-axis of the aeroplane is assumed aligned with the direction of the gravity. In a second stage (section 6.4), once the forces are calculated, the corresponding angle of attack will be considered for the calculation of the correct direction of the forces on the wing;  Influence of thrust and drag (of the total airplane) are considered negligible at this stage of calculation of the vertical forces. The effect of the drag will be considered in a second stage on the wing only; The wing lift is assumed to act on the aerodynamic centre of the wing as a starting point. The contribution of the fuselage is accounted for as a shift of the point of aerodynamic centre. This is better explained in section 6.1.5. The HT lift is applied at 25% of the chord; Effects of structural flexure are considered negligible; Angular accelerations are disregarded until the aeroplane has attained the prescribed load factor (according to requirement 5.2.2.3 ); Note: The assumptions above provide a clear simplification to the calculations. The fact that they are used here does not mean that they can always be used. It is the responsibility of the designer to make the appropriate assumptions and to agree them with the Agency. Based on the above assumptions the following equilibrium equations are set. The basis system of equations include 4 equations with the following unknowns: L: wing Lift (including fuselage) CL: wing lift coefficient LHT: HT lift XAC f+w: aerodynamic centre w+f (wing + fuselage; see sec. 6.1.3 and 6.1.5) Equilibrium of moments  (f. 6.1.2.1) Equilibrium of forces   (f. 6.1.2.2) wing pitching moment   (f.6.1.2.3) (for wing) wing lift coefficient  (f. 6.1.2.4) Aerodynamic centre The aerodynamic centre is a characteristic of the wing and it is defined as the point about which the pitch moment does not change with changes of the angle of attack throughout the linear range of the lift curve.  According to  the aerodynamic centre can be estimated by adding a correction factor (shift) to the quarter chord point of the mean aerodynamic chord. The correction factor is a function of the maximum thickness of the profile which in this wing is 16% of the chord. For a tapered wing, the mean aerodynamic chord corresponds to the mean chord and it is  (see ). For this wing the correction factor is 0.012 (from Fig.2  at 16% thickness), so the mean aerodynamic centre of the wing without fuselage is    (f. 6.1.3.1) Pitching moment of the wing The pitching moment of the profile from two dimensional wind tunnel test data  does not represent the moment of a three dimensional with the profile. The pitching moment of the whole wing is calculated according to DATCOM method 1 (formula 4.1.4.1.a ).  (formula 4.1.4.1.a ) (f. 6.1.4.1) With quarter chord sweep angle of the wing .   Influence of the fuselage The fuselage is assumed to provide negligible lift. On the other hand, its influence on the aeroplane equilibrium is accounted for as a contribution to the pitching moment. In particular the following formula (taken from ref ) provides the shift of the aerodynamic centre of the wing due to fuselage pitching moment.  (f. 6.1.5.1) With  and  as input to the diagram in  yielding  and a correction factor of 1.05 due to low-wing configuration. The shift of aerodynamic centre, due to the fuselage, is calculated as:   (f. 6.1.5.2) Forces and moments acting on the wings In previous chapter the Lift and the lift coefficient have been determined. Having those as inputs, the drag and angle of attack are calculated. Total wing drag coefficient  (FIG. X2.1 of)(f. 6.2.1) Drag force on the wings  (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.2) The angle of attack (using as reference instead of ) for each load case is calculated using the following formula:   (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.3) Where: lift curve slope    (FIG. X2.1 of ) (f. 6.2.4) and the zero-lift angle of the wing is taken as . This value is the zero-lift angle of the corresponding wing profile, taken from ref  (p.236).   The results of this chapter for the load cases highlighted in subchapter 0 are presented within the table below. Table 4 – Loads on the aeroplane Unsymmetrical flight conditions Note: These load cases will not be calculated within this revision of the example document.   Wing load distribution After having calculated the total load on the wing, the load distribution is calculated and shown in the following sections. Every load is assumed to act on the span wise centre of each station.  Figure 4 – Location of wing stations Wing lift distribution The wing lift distribution is calculated here. The lift contribution of the fuselage is assumed to be zero (this means that the load which would act in correspondence of the fuselage, is shifted externally to the wing) leading to more conservative results on the wing loads since they provide higher bending. Note: Alternatively, the applicant would have to determine the reduction in wing lift distribution at the location of the fuselage and demonstrate the validity of the approach.  Figure 5 – Effect of the fuselage, areas A (total lift calculated at the end of this chapter)  and B (total lift according to Schrenk) are of equal size   This approach is based on the approximation described by Schrenk  and requires adjustments: moving the apex of the elliptical distribution from the fuselage centre towards the wing root increasing lift of wetted wing sections to compensate for zero lift of fuselage wing section The formula for wing lift distribution is derived from Schrenk  and is altered to assume zero lift at the wing section within the fuselage as shown below. The formula gives the value of the lift for span unit. “i” identifies the individual station.   Figure 6 –  lift distribution with zero lift at fuselage wing section   ()  (f. 6.4.1.1) Now the lift of the wing section within the fuselage is redistributed across the wetted wing area to achieve conservative results. The lift distribution calculated above is adjusted by multiplication of a correction factor derived from comparison between total lift of the whole wing including the fuselage section and the wetted wing only.  Figure 7 – Fuselage wing section lift redistributed across wetted wing stations        or  (f. 6.4.1.2) The lift distribution corresponding to the formula above, gives a value of lift at wing tip which is higher than zero and therefore does not fully reproduce the actual loading (the winglift is normally zero at the tip). Nevertheless this assumption does not give significant changes and yields conservative results. The local angle of attack for the station I, as a result of this corrected Schrenk distribution, is given by the following formula:  (from f.6.2.3 and f.6.1.2.4) (f. 6.4.1.3) Note: FAA AC 23-19A, paragraph 23.301, contains other acceptable methods.   Figure 9 – Span wise lift distribution  Wing drag distribution Since the effect of the drag is negligible, when compared to the effect of the lift, the span wise drag distribution has been assumed constant throughout wing span. This is a conservative assumption. The drag loading per metre of span:   (f. 6.4.2.1) Wing and fuel mass distribution The local masses are calculated for each wing station to account for the mass of the structure of the wing including the systems and control surfaces (control systems, and other equipment). It is assumed that the wing has a linear distribution proportional to the chord. At each station the point of application of the mass is 45% of the chord.  Figure 10 – Wing mass distribution  Figure 11 – Fuel distribution A constant fuel distribution (at a point of application of 20% of the chord) is assumed throughout the fuel tank span.  Table 5 – Mass distribution with full fuel Wing torsion distribution At each station, the wing lift is assumed to be acting at the local centre of pressure, which is calculated using the formula:  (from eq. 9.17.(d) )  (f. 6.4.4.1) Where, ci is the chord at each station, cm0_w_i is the pitching moment around the aerodynamic centre of the wing section (it is -0.0436 across the wing from chapter 6.1.4), CL_i is the local lift coefficient and comes from the corrected Schrenk distribution () in 6.1.5. Therefore centre of pressure location is dependent on the local angle of attack. Each station’s lift force acts on its centre of pressure and imposes torsion around the wing elastic axis which for this aeroplane is located approximately at a constant chord percentage of 30% (see design data - the main spar is approximately at 25% of the chord) throughout the entire wing span with local positions  as local shear centres at the stations. Note: the location of the elastic axis for this wing has been assumed at 30%. It is responsibility of the applicant to determine and justify the location of the elastic axis.  Incremental torsion load on structure at each station with respect to local wing shear centre including contribution of fuel and wing structure inertia forces:   (f..2) Torsion at each station i (with respect to shear centre) is:    (f. 6.4.4.3) Distribution of internal loads The components of the internal loads on the wing structure are calculated in different steps for each station. The flight load factor n is assumed to act in parallel to the direction of the lift force instead of the direction of the normal force (As required by 5.2.1.1 of ref. ). The difference is assumed negligible. The incremental shear load parallel to lift force vector at station i is taking into account also the inertia unloading of the wing   (f. 6.4.5.1) Incremental shear load parallel to drag force vector at station i:   (f. 6.4.5.2) With  representing the width of the station i. The summation of incremental shear loads throughout the stations to obtain the absolute shear loads at station i is presented below. Shear load parallel to lift force vector   (f..3) Shear load parallel to drag force vector   (f. 6.4.5.4) The components of the loads along the normal and tangential directions are derived by using the following formulas and figure:  Figure 12 – Forces components on the wing (The tangential force is oriented opposite to the x axis and is therefore positive when directed towards the front of the aeroplane.) Resulting force angle   (f.6.4.5.5)  Shear loads along the directions of:  resulting force  (f. 6.4.5.6)  tangential force  (f. 6.4.5.7)  normal force  (f. 6.4.5.8) With the local angle of attack for the station i as a result of the corrected Schrenk distribution given by the following formula:  (from f. 6.4.1.4) Summation of shear loads to obtain the bending moments at each station and using the increased lever arm ( instead of  ) at the wing tip station results in slightly more conservative values. Bending moment along normal direction   (f. 6.4.5.9) Bending moment along tangential direction    (f. 6.4.5.10) The results are presented within the graphs and tables below.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The permissible centre of gravity range is dictated by the aerodynamic design requirements for the airplane. Then the centre of gravity locations corresponding to the critical weights are calculated. All units used are metric (SI units) except for airspeeds (CAS) given in knots if not stated otherwise. Note: The values defined within this document should be used for the placards, markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by testing.

The data contained herein is used to establish aeroplane loading limits: Table 2 – Mass items (Note: In this document the weight of the empty aircraft is assumed to be determined through direct weighing. Such information might be needed during early phases of the design, when no prototype is available. In this case the weight of the empty aircraft should be determined through estimation. It is important in this case to have a breakdown of the main items in terms of weight and locations, so that the weight can be kept under control and avoid situations where the assumed envelope cannot be achieved.) Aircraft weights The following design weights have been identified since: either they are clearly required by the CS-LSA requirements, or they impose critical loads or flight characteristics. Basic empty weight WBEW The basic empty weight needs to be determined to identify its centre of gravity according to requirement 4.2.3  as empty CG. All load conditions determined within this document are based on the basic empty weight of the aircraft. It includes empty weight of the aircraft and the unusable amount of fuel. Basic empty weight has been determined to WBEW = 366 kg. Note: The basic empty weight must include all equipment for the operation intended including optional avionics packages – for example. Basic empty weight (366 kg) vs maximum empty weight WMEW (400kg) According to 4.2.1 of , the minimum useful load  should be 200kg consisting of 172Kg = both seats occupied with persons of 86kg each (4.2.1.1 ) 28kg = fuel for 1 hour flight at  as determined by  (4.2.1.2 ) According to 3.1.2  the maximum empty weight of the aeroplane shall be equal to: . The aeroplane complies with its Basic empty weight including unusable fuel: . Minimum flying weight Wmin (421kg) The minimum flying weight needs to be determined by requirement 4.2.2  and is a design load case leading to highest load factors during gust penetration. It assumes only a pilot of weight of 55 kg.  Minimum full fuel flying weight WminFF (495kg) The minimum flying weight with full fuel is a design load case imposing highest load factors on the fuel tank. This is critical for the fuel tank design and it can be critical also for the wing structure since in this scenario the highest inertia load on the fuel tank introduces torsion about the shear centre in the same direction of the wing aerodynamic load of the wing (the CG of the fuel is forward to the shear centre which is forward to the wing centre of pressure). Maximum zero wing fuel weight WZWF (600kg) The maximum zero wing fuel weight needs to be determined by requirement 5.2.1.3  and is a design load case for the wing loads due to lowest inertia discharge of the wing structure. In this aeroplane this weight equals the Maximum Take-off weight.  Maximum take-off weight WMTOW (600kg) The total aircraft weight must not exceed 600kg regardless whether the aircraft is on ground or in flight. The gross weight of the aeroplane shall not exceed WMTOW = 600kg. The maximum landing weight equals the maximum take-off weight. Loading cases The following loading conditions have been established to identify the critical cases. Table 3 – Loading cases for standard configuration   Centre of gravity location The maximum permissible centre of gravity locations are defined within this chapter. Flight limits The maximum permissible centre of gravity range during flight with respect to datum plane is most forward 0.25m   (required by  4.2.3) most rearward 0.39m   (required by  4.2.3) Limitations on ground The most rearward centre of gravity with the plane on ground must not exceed (with respect to datum plane) 0.46m to prevent the aircraft from flipping on the tail although not more than 0.41m might be reached with the most critical loading configuration. Centre of gravity envelope The following table of load cases defines the limits for the certified envelope of centre of gravity locations and the position of load cases of 6.7 within the envelope. Table 4 – Load cases on centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration   The centre of gravity envelope covers all valid loading cases.  Figure 1 – Centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration Expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification To cover alterations to the aeroplane where need might arise or after certification the aeroplane will be tested and certified against an extended envelope. Additional weights will be added during testing at their corresponding locations to establish the desired loading cases. Table 5 – Weights required to achieve expanded envelope for certification   The expanded centre of gravity envelope is defined by the load cases below using ballast weights at their corresponding locations. Table 6 – Load cases on expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification Note: The values above are preliminary assumptions. Ballast weights need to be checked to be in accordance with airframe strength limitations and their impact on the flight characteristics in terms of inertia before test flights. This might require narrowing the centre of gravity envelope.

operating costs boeing cruise performance monitoring in addition to what might be considered its more common use of deter planning and fmc performance factors cruise performance monitoring can help airlines identify and solve in performance problems often performance monitoring will identify need for boeing to assist in determining the solution to given in problem however with good understanding of the monitoring process and the interactions among the variables involved airlines heir own problem diagnosing and solving cruise performance monitoring has been used for many years by airlines that strive to operate their airplanes as ef as possible these airlines know that continuous cruise performance monitoring of airplanes in their can decrease operating costs relative to airlines that do not monitor airplane performance levels continuous cruise performance monitoring can give airlines the information they need to just the baseline performance levels they use for planning and management computer mc fuel predictions so that the correct amount of fuel is loaded on each and every entify normal deterioration for of airplanes at ch the airplanes that perform best to their

requirement of percent fuel mileage deterioration allowance crease crew con in plans and possibly decrease the amount of discretionary fuel requested and loaded an additional less recognized bene of cruise performance monitoring is diagnosing and solving various airplane performance problems or issues these case studies show how cruise performance monitoring was used to determine solutions to three different problems an airline that operates airplane was concerned about what it considered to be exc ive fuel mileage deterioration relative to the fuel mileage levels its airplanes exhibited when they were new the airline requested help from both boeing and the engine manufacturer in de te mining what was causing this deterioration the airframe the engine or both through better understanding of the contributions that airframe and engine deterioration make to the overall fuel mileage deterioration the airline could more ef focus its maintenance resources to help resolve this issue the airline proposed an experiment involving an engine exchange airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration by dave anderson flight operations engineer and carolyn han reiter aerodynamics engineer aero quarterly qtr ew total fuel mileage diff er ence ol to ne airplane using he ol an ne engine between an old and new airplane six which was operating about percent below the planning database level of fuel mileage represented the old airplane while soon represented the new one the airline requested assistance and support from boeing and the engine manufacturer in carrying out the experiment which would ea sure pre fuel mileage on both the new and the old airplane swap swap all four engines between the new and old airplane ea sure fuel mileage again on both the new and the old airplane swap by using the same physical set of four engines on two different airframes the airline boeing and the engine manufacturer agreed that any measurable difference in fuel mileage for the same set of engines on two different airframes could be attributed to airframe effects alone that is drag deterioration boeing position was that proper maintenance of the exterior of an airplane would lead to minimal amounts of drag deterioration as an airplane ages as result the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including con inspection so that it would be considered as having properly maintained exterior before the engine swap control surfaces were re rigged seals were repaired and one engine was replaced minor leak in the pneumatic system discovered during the was not by the airline to cause about percent penalty in fuel mileage fuel mileage data was collected before and after the to determine any change across the check especially to quantify any changes resulting from re rigging the control surfaces and replacing any worn seals fuel mileage improved percent after the with percent attributed to proper re rigging of the controls and percent attributed to the changing of one engine fuel mileage data was then collected on both the old and new airplanes before and after the engine swap the data collected was combination of in data collected by the airplane condition monitoring system acm and hand data that was collected under more controlled test conditions average results from all four sets of data were then compared to determine the differences in fuel mileage between the old and new airplanes with the same set of engines for both the old and new engines the average improvement in fuel mileage for the new airframe relative to the old airframe was about percent the initial conclusion could be that the older airframe must contribute about percent toward the overall fuel mileage deterioration originally observed on the old airplane and engine combination however about percent of that difference is explainable of the total calculated difference of percent the pneumatic duct leakage discovered on the old airplane during the contributed about percent in addition the old airplane did not have the same revised vertical fairing as the new if the older airplane had had the newer vertical fairing it is estimated that the fuel mileage would have improved about percent after adjusting for the pneumatic system leak and the newer vertical fairing for the same set of engines the old airplane fuel mileage averaged about percent worse than the new airplane the results are supportive of the position that the drag deterioration of well airplane most likely will not exceed more than about percent the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including cong ration inspection boeing ne vertical fin fairing pneumatic leakage actual unexplainable diff er ence case study to help determine the primary cause of the fuel mileage deterioration boeing and the airline collected fuel mileage data on both new and old before and after an engine exchange an airline expressed concern to boeing that its new cfm airplanes equipped with aviation partners boeing apb blended winglets were exhibiting fuel mileage performance more than percent worse than the boeing database level while its older non winglet approximately two years old displayed fuel mileage performance similar to the database level the airline which collects cruise fuel mileage data on an ongoing basis based its analysis on acm cruise fuel mileage data analyzed using the boeing airplane performance monitoring apm program in initial discussions between boeing and the airline it was explained that the database being used by the airline to represent the with blended winglets was based on the original winglet test results completed in early this is the same database used in the flight crew operations manual the mc and the operational planning database additional tests had led to boeing latest best assessment of the delivered performance of the winglets which showed slightly less improvement than the original testing this revised database based on several add ition al test programs conducted in and includes different winglet drag increment to non winglet and an aer elastic correction absent in the earlier database at mach the difference between the two databases varies from percent to percent depending on the exact conditions with the airline database predicting better fuel mileage increment because of the winglets in all cases upon request the airline provided boeing with acm data for two of its airplanes with blended winglets boeing analyzed the data for each airplane using both the operational database and the revised database while the data was on average about percent closer to the newer database level than the operational database level boeing analysis did not agree with the airline analysis boeing analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the airline further discussions with the airline revealed that it had been using passenger weight allo ance of kg per passenger including carry baggage and kg per checked bag for all of its as of june the airline changed to the higher passenger weight allowances recommended in the joint aviation requirements operations ar checked baggage would be weighed whenever possible otherwise ar checked baggage weight allowances would be used the average passenger weight allowances are igni higher than the kg per passenger the airline had been using because the data sent to boeing for the two winglet airplanes was collected prior to june it was based on the lighter weight allowance of kg per investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall boeing analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the airline aero quarterly qtr passenger the airline analysis was based on data using combination of the weight allowances as the investigation continued the airline sent additional data to boeing for the same two winglet airplanes but only for conditions recorded after june based on the higher jar weight allowances the airline also included data for one more winglet airplane as well as for three non winglet airplanes the data for the two winglet airplanes showed an immediate fuel mileage improvement of about percent for each airplane based on analyzing only the data from ar weight allowances collected after june this result led quickly to the belief that the previous kg per passenger weight allowance was too light although both the fuel mileage and thrust required changed igni between data based on kg per passenger and data based on ar passenger weight allowances the thrust fuel consumption tsf hardly changed errors in the estimated weight of an airplane present themselves as high or low drag but do not affect the fuel tsf deviations calculated by apm igni improvement was observed for both of the winglet airplanes originally analyzed with data recorded before june the results for all six airplanes were still not as good as what boeing experience indicated for this model further investigation determined that this airline operates its of in mix of both scheduled and holiday charter using the spec ar weight allowances called out for each the data sent to boeing for the six airplanes included mixture of data from both these types of the average passenger weight allowance recommended for scheduled service is kg per passenger and kg per passenger for charter service are higher than the kg per passenger originally used by the airline at boeing request the airline separated all of the post june data into two groups charter service and scheduled service the data for each group was reanalyzed separately and the analysis revealed igni discrepancy in demonstrated fuel mileage and thrust levels between the charter and scheduled if airplane weight is underestimated perceived airplane performance will be poorer than expected weight that is unaccounted for shows up as increased airplane drag and decreased fuel mileage in this analysis the tsf deviations remained consistent between both sets of data but the thrust deviations increased igni for the charter strong indication of unaccounted airplane weight in this situation boeing proposed that the jar passenger weight allowances as recommended for holiday charter were underestimating the airplane weight for this particular airline charter operations although the airline was receptive to the possibility that the ar passenger weight allowances might be too light for its holiday charter it was not fully convinced the airline believed that the ar weight allowances for scheduled could just as easily be incorrect in which case their airplanes were performing as poorly as the charter data indicated to determine which weight allowances were correct the airline and boeing agreed to collect delivery performance data on the airline next new airplane delivery with production blended winglets installed the advantages of collecting delivery data as opposed to in data are he performance level of the airplane could be established at delivery he airplane would be weighed at the boeing factory with all the weight changes following weighing but preceding delivery accurately tracked and published in the weight and balance manual therefore the delivery empty weight could be considered accurate delivery are with minimum crew so the issue of passenger weight allowances would not exist after collecting cruise performance data on the delivery the airline would continue with its standard in data collection on both scheduled and charter comparing the results from the delivery with the results obtained in would help determine which jar passenger weight allowances gave the airline more accurate airplane gross weights if the weight allowances were too heavy airplane was actually lighter than estimated then the in performance would appear to be better than the delivery performance if the weight allowances were too light airplane was heavier than estimated then the in performance would appear to be worse than the delivery level the airline provided boeing with the weeks of acm in data for the airplane following delivery separating the data for charter and scheduled for this analysis the data was analyzed relative to the most recent with winglets database although the delivery results showed the airplane to be slightly better than the demonstrated database level the early in charter results show the airplane with an average per fuel mileage percent worse than the demonstrated level unaccounted weight shows up as airplane drag required according to the charter data the airplane experienced percent increase in thrust required on entering service partially offset by percent drop in engine tsf for percent drop in fuel mileage from the delivery level when the same ai plane scheduled service data for the same time period was analyzed the fuel mileage was much closer to the delivery level average in fuel mileage for the weeks of operation deviated from the delivery level by only percent percent below the demonstrated level which is within the acm ability to determine fuel mileage over given time period these results supported the conclusion that for this airline the ar passenger weight allo ance for scheduled more accurately re the true weight of the passengers plus carry baggage than the weight allowances recommended for the charter in addition both are much more representative than the original kg per passenger the airline had been using the weight allowances for scheduled of kg per passenger produce more accurate zero fuel weight buildup and truer representation of the actual performance of the airplane with or without winglets the results of this case study ident airplane weight buildup issue for this particular airline boeing suggested that the jar holiday charter passenger weight allowances appeared to be too light for this airline operations with unaccounted weight showing up as excess airplane thrust required using the ar passenger weight allowances for scheduled the fuel mileage performance for its with and without winglets is close to predicted and re boeing

winglets on of its to determine the magnitude of this improvement cruise fuel mileage data collected after the install of the winglets would be compared to data collected before the installation the airline provided acm data collected on each of the airplanes before and after the installation of the winglets to boeing for analysis and comment retro the winglets is two process comprising structural reinforcement of the wing followed by installation of the winglet eleven of the airplanes had the wing reinforcement completed many weeks before the winglets were installed with the airplanes returning to service with the reinforced wings for these airplanes the non winglet data was based on this reinforced wing con three of the airplanes had the wing reinforced and winglet installed at the same time for these three airplanes the non winglet data was based on the production non reinforced wing the two sets of data were analyzed separately in order to identify any differences in the improvement based on differences in the baseline before the winglets were installed boeing analyzed the data for all airplanes using the same in software tools used to analyze boeing data these software tools are different from the apm software provided to airline customers but the analysis produces basically the same results the main difference is that the boeing in software normalizes the data points to nominal weight to pressure ratios chosen by boeing while the apm software does not the improvements were plotted versus in order to illustrate that the magnitude of the improvement depends on for given mach number this dependency on is because the winglet improvement is function of airplane lift coef which in turn is function of weight altitude and speed the improvements were determined by comparing both the non winglet and winglet fuel mileage results to the non winglet database the performance improvement because of the winglet is not the average

for each and for the various sets of data and boeing analysis of the data indicated slight improvement in drag and fuel mileage weight that resulted from the reinforcement of the wing structure the results indicated this improve to be relatively small but still worth an average of few tenths of percentage at normal cruise weights and altitudes including the effects of both the wing strengthening and the addition of the winglets the fuel mileage and drag improve closely matched their predicted levels because the improvement in drag is fun of for given cruise speed the actual improvement in fuel mileage that the airline would experience for any given conditions depends on the during that airline operations the change in total fuel required to given route is determined by combination of the improvement in fuel mileage offset by any increase in airplane weight retro the winglets to the including wing reinforcement currently adds about kg to the empty weight of the airplane and this additional weight alone would increase fuel burn approximately percent to percent for an average leg an analysis similar to the boeing analysis could have been carried out by the airline itself using the spreadsheet output option from the apm software program the results of analyzing the data in this manner would differ by only relatively small amount from the analysis carried out using the boeing

quarterly qtr increasing economic and regulatory pressures make it imperative for airt unities to reduce costs and show conformance to manufacturer data because airline maintenance operations represent airlines have asked boeing for help in reducing this cost recent results show that changing the way service bulletins are prepared and delivered combined with airline process improvements can reduce maintenance cosy and improve the ability to show conformance boeing has continually made enhancements to the content format and delivery of its service bulletins past enhancements include digital delivery simp li english and tabular work instructions boeing has been working directly with airlines to reduce end costs for service bulletin incorporation during this process it was observed that when airlines create their engineering orders they rewrite or re engineer service bulletins and re kit or repackage the kit of parts to match their own engineering orders this re engineering causes unnecessary delays and expense for the airlines in implementing service bulletins boeing developed the enhanced service bulletin also known as the generation service bulletin to minimize this re engineering effort while making it easier and less expensive to implement service bulletins the enhanced service bulletin in conjunction with airline process improvements will enable smooth work ensuring that information parts and tools are staged in coordinated manner to support the mechanic during service bulletin incorporation boeing enhanced service bulletins incorporate four key features lean work instructions faster access to essential information improved kit packaging and selective information extraction these features have been incrementally introduced into boeing service

this change alone can result in igni time savings in both the operations and maintenance arenas selective information extraction enhanced service bulletins enable airline personnel to extract

study the predicted bene of the enhanced service bulletin study data from the airline showed these predicted bene potential percent reduction in defects attributed to the rewriting or re engineering of the service bulletin data into the airline document management system potential percent reduction in labor hours to develop and release the service bulletin data into the airline document management system based on the positive results of the study data boeing continued to work closely with the same airline to collect actual labor hour bene the actual data was obtained by comparing airline incorporation of conventional ser bulletin on part of its and an enhanced version of the same service bulletin on the remainder of its data from the airline showed these actual results reduction in nonrecurring engineering labor hours to develop the airline own engineering and job cards from labor hours to labor hours reduction in recurring kit packaging labor hours from hours to hours per airplane to date boeing has issued more than service bulletins across all boeing model airplanes with one or more of the four key features described above boeing has been working with number of airlines to assist in the adoption and implementation of enhanced service bulletins into their operations as well as to obtain airline user feedback such feedback is key to adding improvements to the enhanced service bulletins boeing understands that each airline maintenance operation is unique and is willing to work with individual airlines to ensure that each leverages all of the bene possible from enhanced service bulletins and that the bulletins well with existing airline operations airlines may contact their boeing field service representative for assistance in adopting enhanced

age of ne tec ologies to increase re lia bi lit an im pro ve maintain abi lit boeing with the dream liner boeing is using new approach to design which takes into greater account the cost to maintain airplane structure and systems over their lifetimes as result of this approach the basic airplane will have percent lower airframe maintenance costs than any comparable product and will be available for revenue service more often than any other commercial airplane the boeing program has consciously designed in new state features and performance that reduce cost and increase airplane availability these features will lead to additional savings and greater revenue for boeing customers the re new life design philosophy that has dictated some igni changes in the way the airplane will be built these changes include extensive use of composites in the airframe and primary structure an electric systems architecture reliable and maintainable design and an improved maintenance program taken together these changes will offer customers guaranteed reduction in maintenance costs the life cost approach to design looks at the total cost picture for design options by examining all of the factors that affect an airplane over its lifetime traditionally the value of given design solution has been measured using factors such as drag weight oise and community schedule reliability development cost uil cost using these measures to compare design options helps determine the optimum choice with the boeing has expanded the life design approach by adding two unique performance measures maintenance cost and airplane availability clearly looking at the cost to maintain systems over their lifetimes becomes igni factor when attempting to understand the total effect of design decision on an operator cost structure airplane availability includes not only schedule reliability but also other factors such as the length of time an airplane must be out when maintenance is required obviously taking an airplane out of service for two days has much bigger effect on operator revenue than taking it out of service for two hours boeing from the ground upby justin hale deputy chief mechanic aero quarterly qtr advanced composites aluminum titanium steel landing gear boeing makes greater use of composite materials in its airframe and primary structure than any previous boeing commercial airplane under the design process without preconceived ideas enabled boeing engineers to specify the optimum material for spec applications throughout the airframe the result is an airframe comprising nearly half carbon reinforced plastic and other composites this approach offers weight savings on average of percent compared to more conventional aluminum designs selecting the optimum material for spec application meant analyzing every area of the airframe to determine the best material given the operating environment and loads that component experiences over the life of the airframe for example aluminum is sensitive to tension loads but handles compression very well on the other hand composites are not as ef in dealing with compression loads but are excellent at handling tension the expanded use of composites especially in the highly tension environment of the fuselage greatly reduces maintenance due to fatigue when compared with an aluminum structure this type of analysis has resulted in an increased use of titanium as well where loading indicates metal is preferred material system but environmental considerations indicate aluminum is poor choice titanium is an excellent low design solution titanium can withstand comparable loads better than aluminum has minimal fatigue con and is highly resistant to corrosion titanium use has been expanded on the to roughly percent of the total airframe every structural element of the has undergone this type of life analysis and material types are based on thorough and disciplined selection process how co mpo si te lu tion are app li ed thro ug ho ut the in addition to using robust structural design in damage areas the has been designed with the capability to be repaired in exactly the same manner that airlines would repair an airplane today with bolted repairs these can be just as permanent and damage tolerant as they are on metal structure boeing in addition to lowering the overall airplane weight moving to composite primary structure promises to reduce both the scheduled and nonroutine maintenance burden on the airlines reduced scheduled maintenance ex per ence with the boeing proves that composite str ct ure require less scheduled maintenance than noncom structures for example the composite tail is percent larger than the aluminum tail yet requires percent fewer scheduled maintenance labor hours this labor hour reduction is due to the result of reduced risk of corrosion and fatigue of composites compared with metal reduced nonroutine maintenance com structure also results in less nonroutine maintenance the structure is all composite and highlights the advantages of this material when applied in harsh environ airline operators are aware of the fatigue cracking and corrosion dif experienced with traditional aluminum beams the model has been for more than years with more than airplanes in the and to date has not replaced single composite beam boeing has also implemented rigorous process for evaluating the use of aluminum that combines likelihood of corrosion with consequence of corrosion this scoring system provides de measure for establishing acceptable application of aluminum in the design with full understanding of the maintenance implications corrosion and fatigue in structure add igni to the nonroutine maintenance burden on an operator nonroutine maintenance frequently double or even triples the total labor hours expended during maintenance check with the expanded use of composites and titanium combined with greater discipline in usage of aluminum boeing expects the to have much lower nonroutine labor costs than more conventional metallic airframe in addition to using robust structural design in damage areas such as passenger and cargo doors the has been designed from the start with the capability to be repaired in exactly the same manner that airlines would repair an airplane today with bolted repairs the ability to perform bolted repairs in composite structure is service on the and offers comparable repair times and skills as employed on metallic airplanes by design bolted repairs in composite structure can be permanent and damage tolerant just as they can be on metal structure in addition airlines have the option to perform bonded composite repairs which offer improved aerodynamic and aesthetic these repairs are permanent damage tolerant and do not require an autoclave while typical bonded repair may require or more hours of airplane downtime boeing has taken advantage of the properties of composites to develop new line of maintenance repair capability that requires less the right material for the right application without preconceived ideas boeing engineers were able to specify the optimum material for spec applications throughout the airframe aero quarterly qtr than an hour to apply this rapid composite repair technique offers temporary repair capability to get an airplane again quickly despite minor damage that might ground an aluminum airplane in total the reduced risk of corrosion and fatigue associated with composites combined with the com repair techniques described will lower overall maintenance costs and maximize airline revenue by keeping airplanes as much as possible the boeing re completely new approach to onboard systems virtually everything that has traditionally been powered by bleed from the engines has been transitioned to an electric architecture the affected systems include gine start ux ilia ry power unit apu start wing ice protection bin pressurization hydraulic pumps the only remaining bleed system on the is the anti system for the engine inlets while much can be said regarding the ef gains achieved by changing the means of extracting power for airplane systems from the engines the no architecture brings with it some sig maintenance cost and reliability advantages as well by eliminating the pneumatic systems from the airplane the will realize notable reduction in the mechanical complexity of airplane systems the list below highlights just few of the compo eliminated as result of this systems change neumatic engine and apu start motors apu load compressor re coolers various ducts valves and air control systems eak and overheat detection systems auxiliary power unit the apu provides an excellent illustration of the be ne of the more architecture one of the primary functions of conventional apu is driving large pneumatic load compressor replacing the pneumatic load compressor with starter generators results in igni improved start reliability and power availability the use of starter generators reduces maintenance requirements and increases reliability due to the simpler design and lower parts count in terms of in start reliability the apu is expected to be approximately four times more reliable than conventional apu with pneumatic load compressor electrical power generation another funda tal architectural change on the is the use of variable frequency electrical power and the integration of the engine generator and starter functions into single unit this change enables elimination of the constant speed drive known as the integrated drive generator id greatly reducing the complexity of the generator in addi by using the engine generator as the starter motor approach used with great success on the

enabling in maintenance of the brakes in general electric systems are much easier to monitor for health and system status than hydraulic or pneumatic systems the brakes take full advantage of this continuous onboard monitoring of the brakes provides airlines with number of advantages such as fault detection and isolation lect rica monitoring of brake wear ility to eliminate scheduled visual brake wear inspections tended parking times because the brakes can monitor the braking force applied even while parked the electric brakes enable extended parking brake times by monitoring and automatically adjusting its parking brakes as the brakes cool at an airplane level the reduction in systems parts by moving to primarily electric architecture is igni overall the will reduce mechanical systems complexity by more than percent compared to elimination of pneumatic systems is major contributor as consequence of this reduction in complexity airlines will experience reduced airplane maintenance costs and improved airplane dispatch reliability in fact the move to electric systems is expected to cut about third of the schedule interrupts com to for the systems affected by

models these improvements optimize the content and interval of maintenance tasks to maintain safety and reliability and achieve co improvements are based on boeing analysis of in data collected from the wort all improvements are reviewed and approved through an industry process involving boeing operators and regulatory agencies over the decades boeing has worked closely with the aviation industry to develop robust processes that ensure scheduled maintenance programs adhere to the highest safety and operational reliability levels in creating and updating its scheduled maintenance programs boeing uses process as outlined in federal aviation administration advisory circular review board procedures that involves the establishment of an industry steering committee isc in data collection and analysis and recommendation from boeing for each individual task under review an isc comprises operators manufacturers and regulators who follow the guidance outlined in advisory circular ac to develop the scheduled maintenance program for an airplane model and the resulting maintenance review board report mr br it is the function of the isc under the direction of chairperson operator selected by its peer operators to develop and establish policy for the development of the mr br proposal and participate in the review and approval process of the isc isc meetings for all models which are held on an as basis take place in seattle wash or long beach calif and generally last one week meetings are open to all operators and typically cover spec boeing airplane model or de set of models the airframe manufacturer serves as an isc co and has the duties of receiving in data to be analyzed for proposed mr br changes providing the isc with suf technical data to base decisions on proposed

operator may become representative voting member of an isc operators strongly in the success of scheduled maintenance program revision by providing in data boeing analyzes the data provided by the operators to identify important trends for incorporation into the scheduled maintenance programs through the isc process the operators and boeing work together to identify areas within the scheduled maintenance program to review for optimization in data is collected by the operators and sent to boeing for review and analysis for each ident maintenance task boeing reviews the data and analyzes the positive and negative in results boeing also reviews service bulletins reliability data service letters airworthiness directives and any other pertinent documents and coordinates proposed changes with other boeing or supplier engineering groups once the analysis is complete boeing makes recommendation for each individual task under review and presents it to the isc participating operators and the

days to perform required main te checks every months the addition of months to this maintenance interval provides igni and scheduling opportunities to opera other tasks that have been escalated in the new maintenance program include many general inspections which have increased from to days the result saves more than labor per airplane per year and increases airplane availability by providing airlines with one additional day of revenue operation annually for each in their using industry averages the reduced maintenance costs and increased revenue opportunities added more than usd in annual

considered an economic not safety task operators provided test results for this task with no adverse and the isc determined that the interval for this task could be extended from to hours as with the other tasks that were escalated this change enables operators to arrange their maintenance programs in more ef manner without compromising safety boeing continues to seek optimization of its maintenance requirements using improved data collection and the isc processes boeing is currently developing program that collects and stores real in data from scheduled maintenance visits in line and hangar environment and ass oci ates this data with the scheduled maintenance task the program enables data to be gathered and analyzed centrally for use by the industry in adjusting current scheduled maintenance tasks or check intervals based on in this will allow isc to be more proactive in managing scheduled maintenance programs it also will allow operators to benchmark against other participating operators expedite ground times for line and hangar maintenance visits and plan spares and consumables using worldwide averages for scheduled maintenance the isc process maintains safety

satellites are in view all ifr installations require remote annunciators to be mounted in the aircraft panel in order to select and indicate the status of certain kln functions en route and terminal ifr certifications require annunciators for message and way point alert non precision approach certifications also require switch to select and display when the approach mode is armed or active each kln system includes configuration module which is attached to the kln mounting rack the module allows the kln to be configured for the unique characteristics of your equipment installation parameters

north americas south data base coverage areas figure kln data base geographical region kln pilot guided ata base base chapter data base data basics the data base provides two primary functions first it makes pilot interface with the gps sensor much easier rather than having to manually look up and then enter the latitude and longitude for spe ci fic way point it allows you to merely enter simple way point identifier the data base automatically looks up and displays the lati tude and longitude associated with the identifier it should be obvious that the data base saves lot of tedious latitude entry and also greatly reduces the potential for data input mistakes second function of the data base is that it serves as very con means to store and easily access aeronautical information want to know the name of the airport the nearest city or the airport elevation just unleash the power of the kln and display the information right on the screen the kln data base stores non approaches in their proper sequence this allows you to select an approach as whole rather than entering the approach way point by way point data base contents and coverage areas there are four data base coverage areas available for the kln they are referred to as the north data base the south data base the data base and the data base international civil aviation organization and aeronautical radio inc break the world into the ten geographic regions shown in figure the kln americas north data base con tains aeronautical information for the group of icao regions consisting of canada usa and latin america the kln americas south data base contains aeronautical information for the group of icao regions consisting of usa latin america and south america the kln atlantic data base provides information for

training warning user defined way points identifier latitude and longitude icao identifiers way points are stored in the kln database almost exclusively by their icao identifiers icao civil aviation organization is an internationally accepted reference for the data in almost all cases the proper icao identifiers may be taken directly from eppes en or nos aeronautical charts identifiers in the contiguous united states alaska and canada are special cases in the icao system many airport ident fie rs for these areas have four letters beginning with prefix letter that corresponds to the geographic area in which it is located the prefix letter for the contiguous is thus the identifier for dallas worth international airport is dfw not dfw would be identical to the vor identifier likewise the identifier for orlando executive airport is kor while the vor identifier is orl the prefix letter for canada is and for alaska is there are several exceptions in alaska in many cases air ports with three letter identifiers receive the prefix but there are many that don the most reliable method of determining an alaska airport identifier is to look it up from the airport name or city see sec tion way points by name or city you can program the kln to default to certain letter as when you are entering way point identifier see section entry to learn about this handy feature all airport identifiers receive the prefix letter airport identifiers which are combinations of letters and numbers do not apply to the prefix rule examples of airport identifiers not using the prefix are and remember if you are entering or looking for an airport ident fie that is all letters numbers then it will begin with prefix in the contiguous in alaska some cases or in canada if there are numbers in the identifier then prefix is not used for other areas of the world the airport iden ti fie stored in the kln data base is identical to how it is charted updating the data base the information stored in the data base would eventually become obsolete if there wasn some means to update it for example new airports open navaids can move or change frequency com munic tion frequencies can change and on and on base base chapter by faa regulation you are required to have current data base in order to use the kln for non approach data base is contained in small card which plugs into the left side of the kln front panel it is designed so that there are two ways for the user to easily keep the data base current the first is to electronically update the data base by means of diskette supplied by honeywell and an ibm personal computer this method does not have to involve removing the kln from the aircraft instrument panel jack usually mounted in the air craft instrument panel provides means of interfacing the kln with the computer via an interface cable the diskettes are not returned to honeywell second method of data base update is to remove the old card and insert current card this method involves returning the old card to honeywell days honeywell receives new nav data from eppes en sanderson this information is processed and down loaded onto both diskettes and data base cards honeywell makes these two types of update services available to you in choice of several subscription or random update programs see section for details on these programs sends the update so that it arrives prior to the next effective date the new update may be installed any time prior to the effective date and the kln will use the previous data up to the effective date and automatically begin using the new data on the effective date warning the accuracy of the data base information is only assured if it is used before the end of the effectivity period use of out of date data base information is done entirely at the user own risk computer updating of the data base update information is sent to you on disks in order to use the update program you must have access to computer having disk drive capable utilizing megabyte high density diskettes this computer also needs to have an available com or com ser ial port if you wish to perform updates in the cockpit an optional pc interface kit must be used included in the kit is an interface cable that plugs into both the computer and into the data loader jack the data loader jack is included with the kln installation kit and is typically installed in the aircraft instrument panel pilot guided ata base base chapter data base base chapter the data base must be updated only while the air craft is on the ground the kln does not perform any navigation function while the data base is being updated since data base update takes approximately minutes it is good idea to turn off all electrical equipment on the aircraft except for the kln to avoid running down the aircraft battery diskettes sent to you can only be used to update one kln although they can update that specific unit numerous times the first time the diskettes are used in an update operation unique identification code from the kln being used is uploaded to the diskettes these diskettes may be used in this specific kln an unlimited number of times which could be required if you switch back and forth between the americas north americas south atlantic and pacific data bases during one update cycle these diskettes may not however be used to update other kln this update protection ensures that eppes en sanderson is properly compensated for the use of their nav data update the kln data base by computer the pin female connector end of the interface cable into com serial port of the computer if the computer has com and com serial ports either may be used some computers use pin com serial port connector while other computers use pin

few minutes or less in order for the kln to reach nav ready condition it is necessary to meet the following con dition kln data should be current almanac data is orbital information for all the satellites and is used for initial acquisition when the kln is first turned on this data is stored in the kln non memory and is considered current for up to six months each satellite sends almanac

the time to first fix will usually be less than two minutes if this information is not correct then the kln will start to look for any satellites eventually the kln will find enough satellites to determine the position of the aircraft this process can take as long as minutes it is possible for you to update this information manually which will allow the kln to reach nav ready status much

well acquainted this will allow you to utilize it to the maximum extent great way to get to know the kln is to use it outside the airplane using what we call the mode are products available which allow you to use the kln at your home office or hotel to have get time in the take mode for instance the commander from lone star aviation it is also helpful to do flight planning and perform data base updates outside the airplane perhaps with home personal computer more information on the commander or to place an order con star aviation corp tatum drive arlington tx phone fax the kln is in the take mode it performs as if it is receiving adequate satellite signals to determine its position it displays the latitude and longitude of its last known position or of whatever posi tion it is initialized to on the setup page section and time to first fix in addition ground speed and heading may be entered on the set page and the kln will track flight plan or direct to way point just as if it was actually functioning in an aircraft distances count down way points sequence and the devi tion bar follows the progress of the simulated flight using the take mode is an excellent way to learn the operation of the kln without worrying about the engine running other traffic or even terrain fortunately these phenomena are not simulated in the take mode kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid approaches and sid only this is the last chapter on the operation of the kln in this chapter you will learn how to use the kln for non approach and sid procedures note that only kln which are configured for ifr approaches are capable of performing the procedures discussed in this chapter kln which are con figured for en route and terminal operations only will give you access to sid procedures but not non procedures all of these procedures require that you are comfortable with the operation of the unit as presented up to this point in particular you need to be comfortable with flight plan operation and and the obs mode non approach operations flying non approaches using the kln are not in them selves very difficult however it is different than using traditional equipment such as vor and ndb with this in mind make sure that you practice with the kln in vfr weather with check pilot before attempting to use the kln in actual ifr conditions the kln obtains approach information from the data base therefore it is extremely important that the data base is current the kln is approved for ifr non approaches only when the data base is current if you attempt to select an approach when the data base is out of date you will be given the status message base expire in the bottom left portion of the screen as reminder following sections assume that your kln is properly installed in the aircraft with all of the necessary accessories to fly non approaches in most cases this will mean that the air craft has external switch to arm the approach mode an external annunciator to indicate when message is active and when way point sequencing is about to occur will also be installed in some installations the aircraft will have nav switch to select which navigation source is displayed on the primary hsi or cdi nav page has been specifically designed to provide most of the functions needed for non approaches this page pro vide an interface that presents pertinent navigation information way to access the flight plan and graphic presentation of the pre sent position relative to the flight plan way points you will find this page to be good friend while performing gps based non approaches approaches and sid and sid there are some approach procedures in the world that are not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base therefore it is not possible to use the kln for these approaches it is good pre flight practice ensure that the kln contains anticipated procedures for the flight addition to the two course modes and obs described in sec there are also two approach modes these are approach arm and approach active the status of the approach mode is indi cat ed on an external switch in most installations the external annunciator will indicate arm for the approach arm mode and approach active will be annunciated by act the main differ ence of these modes from the normal en route mode is that the integrity monitoring is set to tighter level another difference between these modes and the en route mode is that the cdi scale factor will usually change to nm for arm and will always change to nm when in the apr act mode the arm mode can be selected in two ways the normal way is that this mode will be selected automatically by the kln when the aircraft is within nm of an airport and an approach is loaded in the flight plan for that airport it is possible to arm the approach mode at distance greater than nm from the airport by pressing the exter al gps approach switch but the kln will not change the cdi scale factor until the aircraft reaches the nm point if the gps apr external switch is pressed while the approach mode is armed then the kln will disarm the approach and change back to en route mode the cdi scale factor will also change back to nm the approach can be re by simply pressing the gps apr switch again the apr act mode can only be engaged automatically by the kln to cancel the apr act mode press the external gps apr switch this will change the mode to apr arm once past the fa it is not possible to return to the approach active mode without con missed approach and flying back to the fa procedure for non approaches non approaches will all have the general flow of events as follows refer to figure and load the approach into the flight plan can bed one at almost any time but must be completed before reaching the final approach fix and should be done as soon as possible kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid corresponds to point in figure if the aircraft is greater than nm from the airport then the cdi scale factor will remain at the default nm full scale deflection to the approach arm mode this will occur auto when the aircraft is within nm of the airport and there is an approach loaded into the flight plan in fig ure the cdi scale factor will change to nm over the next seconds and the external annunciator will indicate arm established

integrity monitoring is available to complete the approach aim is available at fa ma pif any of these conditions are not met the kln will not transition to the approach active mode and missed approach will be required if the conditions do not change before reaching the fa if all of these conditions are met then the cdi scale factor will start to change to nm and the external annunciator will indicate act the fa in figure the cdi scale factor will be at nm and will remain at this scale factor until you manually cancel the approach mode by either pressing the external gps apr button to change to the arm mode by initiating direct to operation or by changing to obs mode it is not approved to conduct the final portion of the approach unless the kln is in the approach active mode on external annunciator to the missed approach point in figure the kln will not automatically sequence to the next way point must manually change to the appropriate way point accord ing to the situation by default the kln will nominate the first way point of the published missed approach procedure when is pressed and the active way point is the map and you have flown past the map number in section necessary conduct the missed approach procedure remember to always refer to the paper chart when conducting missed approach the obs mode is usually needed at some point during missed approach and is always required to fly the holding pattern in figure details of the above operations as well as several examples of how to conduct non approaches using the kln are given in the following sections and sid and sid selecting an approach the first item in the list from the previous section is to select and load the approach into the active flight plan approaches are selected from the apt act page of the airport for which you desire to shoot the approach if you are operating from flight plan the easi est way to get to the approach information is by turning to the act page for your destination as described in section following example will use the vor or gps rwy approach to los angeles international airport select and load an approach into the active flight plan to one of the apt pages and select lax by using the cursor inner and outer knobs the right inner knob to turn to the apt page if you select ed lax from the apt page turn the inner knob one click counter to reach the apt page the cursor on by pressing the cursor comes up on the first approach in the list of approaches use the right outer knob to move the cursor to different approaches if there are more than approaches to an airport you can move the cur sor down to the other procedures into view by rotating the right outer knob the flashing cursor over vor kln will present list of initial approach fixes corresponding to this approach in this example we want the elmo iaf select this by pressing when the cursor is over elmo note if there is only one iaf for procedure then the kln will skip this step and go on to the next step pilot guide approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and sid and sid many cases atc will not tell you explicitly which iaf to use in these cases you need to select an iaf which is closest to the route of flight that you expect if you expect radar vectors then the selection of the correct iaf is less important because you will be given vectors to the fa and will not need to use the iaf kln next presents list of way points that make up the approach review these way points to make sure that you have selected the correct iaf if there are more than four way points in the approach you can move the cursor up to other way points into view by rotating the right outer knob the cursor over add of pl and press kln will then bring up the pl page and put the sequence of approach way points in front of the airport reference point any time during the process of selecting an approach you can easily return to the previous step by pressing the button way points that make up the approach procedure are loaded into the flight plan at the top of the list of approach way points is that describes the approach that follows an example of this is shown on line of figure which indicates that the vor approach for los angeles international airport is in the active flight plan the approach has been entered into the flight plan the kln to make sure that the resulting flight plan sense if the kln detects any way points that are in both the en route por tion of the flight plan and the portion that makes up the approach then the following message will be given pts in pl edit en route pts as necessary apt vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb

can only be entered into pl the active flight plan if the kln is turned off for more than minutes then the approach is deleted when power is turned back on interpreting what you see in the example above you may have noticed couple of way point swith somewhat strange names the second way point of the approach procedure lax has name that is not normal for way point this is an example of what are called way points these are way points that are associated with specific airport they are used to define spot on the ground that does not have normal way point name in the case of this point is nm from the lax vor on the the fifth way point in the approach pro ced ure ma is another type of terminal way point in this case this point is the missed approach point for runway this approach applies to both the left and right runways so the letter is used to mean are few other types of terminal way points that you will need tobe familiar with to fully understand gps non approaches the naming convention for these way points are as follows stands for final approach fi xix yy stands for intermediate fix yy stands for course fix mx yy stands for missed approach point rw zzz rw stands for runway fix this is usually the map for the approach zzz will be runway number possibly including for left for right for center or for both stands for dme arc way point aaa is the radial that the fix is on from the reference vor will be letter corresponding to the distance from the reference vor for example is the seventh letter of the alphabet so would be point on the nm from the reference vor dme arcs greater than nm will have way points where the first two characters are the first two letters of the dme identifier the next three characters will be the radial that the arc way point is on the rules above and yy are defined as follows for runways with only one approach will be replaced with an or for run ways that have multiple approaches will be replaced with for vor for ndb or for rna the letters yy will be replaced with either the runway identifier ff or for circling approaches the inbound course to the missed approach point ma along given radial will be named such that the first three letters are the reference vor and the next two are the dme distance if the distance is greater than nm the order is reversed for example lax is nm from lax while is nm from fl the aircraft is not too far from the destination airport the nav can be used to determine where some of these way points are relative to others in the approach at the time of this writing all of the nos charts and some eppes en charts do not show the special ter mina way points that are required for gps approaches for this reason it is good idea to understand what the special way points are used for and what they mean may have also noticed that some way points have small letter at the end of the way point name the small letter is an aid that we have added to the name of some way points to help you recognize important points in the approach these suffixes are displayed on many of the kln pages the definitions of these suffixes are the initial approach fix of the approach the final approach fix of the approach the missed approach point of the approach the missed approach holding point for the approach every approach will have fa and map almost all will have an iaf and missed approach holding point another item that you should notice in the flight plan is the line that has seq on it this is what is referred to as fence and the purpose of this line is to tell you that approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid kln will not automatically sequence past the way point that precedes the fence the way point before the fence is always the missed approach point the reason that way point sequencing is not allowed is that many missed approach procedures require specific actions before going to the missed approach holding point climbing on fixed heading until reaching an altitude changing or deleting an approach once loaded into the flight plan the sequence of way points that are retrieved from the data base of the kln define the approach procedures as they are charted to ensure that the proper path over the ground is followed it is not possible to either delete or add way points to the approach section of the flight plan to help you see which way points are en route way points and which are approach way points the kln does not display colon next to the way point number on the pl page if the way point is an approach way point it is only possible to replace the existing approach with another one delete the entire approach from the flight plan replace an existing approach or delete an approach the left page displaying the active flight plan turn the cursor on by pressing the cursor so that it covers the approach header at the top of the approach procedure once the cursor comes over the approach header it will automatically change to read change ppr if you press in this condition the kln bring up the apt page that corresponds to the current approach at this point it is poss ble to select

to the default nm scale example approach no procedure turn now that you know the basics of inserting an approach into the flight plan we can now show the approach operation of the unit by several examples this first example will use the approach that was loaded into the flight plan in section this example will show how the kln sequences through an approach and what type of an nunci ation and scale factor changes can be expected the kln will remain in the familiar leg mode so there will be no need to change between leg and obs mode in this example refer to the approach plate for this approach to see what the procedure looks like this example it is assumed that you are on an active flight plan with the final destination being the los angeles international airport lax it is also assumed that atc will not give you radar vectors during this approach the vor approach to lax as demonstrated in sec tion you are within nm of the airport the kln will auto mat ically arm the approach mode and provide the following message alt to set baro the message acts as reminder to make sure the kln is using the correct barometric pressure if the barometric information is not correct then the integrity monitoring provided by the kln will not be as good as it could be press to bring up the alt page and verify that the barometric pressure is correct if the kln is interfaced with compatible air data com that provides the correct barometric pressure to the kln then the previous message is not displayed and it is not necessary to update the barometric pressure this time the kln will smoothly change the cdi scale factor to nm the external approach annunciator installed in the aircraft will indicate that the approach is in the arm mode kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid you approach elmo the kln will provide way point alerting on the external annunciator as well as on the screen of the kln once you pass elmo the kln will auto mat ically sequence to the next way point in the approach lax approaches and sid and sid may be good time to select the nav page this page is especially useful for getting feeling of where you are in the approach the aircraft approaches the lax way point the kln will again provide way point alerting as the aircraft passes lax and sequences to fit on the kln will provide message telling you to set the external indicator or hsi to new value if desired track is shown on the screen this value will flash when the external selected course does not match the tk within the aircraft approaches the fa it is good idea to check over the status of the kln look at the kln screen to verify that leg sequencing is selected remember the kln will not transition to the approach active mode if the obs mode is selected if the kln shares an hsi or cdi with other nav sources it is also good to verify that the nav switch is set to gps the time the aircraft is nm from re by the final approach fix the kln will make prediction to see if integrity will be available at the fa and at the map if the pre diction indicates that integrity monitoring will be available and aim is currently available the kln will change the gps apr annunciator to read act at this time the kln will also start to change the cdi scale factor by the time the aircraft reaches the fa the cdi scale factor will be down to nm fix noel is not included in the list of way points provided in the data base you will need to identify this point by using the along track distances given in the profile view of the approach plate in this example noel is located nm from the map when the distance to ma is nm then the aircraft is at noel and you can descend to the md for this approach approach procedures require that you add up several along distances to be able to identify step

approach that is quite common is an approach that is based off fan off navaid an example of this is the vor rwy approach to clovis new mexico municipal airport kc vn to fly this procedure as published use the following steps and refer to figure for the procedure for this example assume that the aircraft is approaches and sid and sid approaching from the northeast going direct the clovis airport with no active flight plan the approach into the flight plan as described in section in this case there is only one iaf so the kln does not present the option for you to select an iaf in this example there is no active flight plan to begin with so the kln will ask to add the approach to pl the area atc tells you to go direct the tx vor and clears you for the approach to kc vn this is easy to do from the nav page by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning through the active flight plan by turning the inner knob once tx is displayed in the scanning window press and then to initiate direct to operation to the tx vor distance of nm to the tx vor the kln will give the following message required select obs this message provides reminder that to fly course reversal the obs mode needs to be selected note from the approach chart that there is opt arrival sector for this approach if you are approach ing tx within the indicated area there is no need to perform course reversal and you need to ignore this message the opt sector is not stored in the data base so it is not possible for the kln to know if course reversal is required or not as result the kln will always give this message whenever way point could be used for course reversal the kln will properly sequence to the fa to map leg and transition to the approach mode when nm from the iaf however you are approaching from any other direction course reversal is required and the obs mode will need to be selected if the obs mode is not selected before reaching tx then the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach point this is not desirable when performing course reversal so the obs mode must be selected before reaching tx the kln will only remind you to select obs mode if the iaf is the active way point therefore if course reversal is required make sure the iaf is the selected way point pilot guide approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and sid and

point the kln works very similar to con vent ion al vor established on the inbound course of switch back to the leg mode when leg mode is selected the fa is automat cally made the active way point when the iaf and the fa are at the same way point is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the fa as the active way point before crossing the fa to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale factor the cdi scale fac tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the fa delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor change this will make the transition more abrupt if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active mode the aircraft is nm from the fa the kln will verify that the proper integrity is available if integrity monitoring is available for the approach then the kln will change to the approach active mode this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to nm reaching tx the kln will automatically sequence to rw the missed approach point fix at dme from tx along the final approach course is not included in the way points that come from the data base since the distance that the kln is giving you is distance to the map you will need to mentally figure out when the aircraft has reached this point is done by looking at the along track distances given in the plan view of the approach in this case the fix is nm from rw upon reaching this distance you can descend to the md for this approach missed approach is required for this approach then the following steps would be required published missed approach procedure for this approach is to make climbing

to confirm the way point and proceed direct to the vor if atc gives you instructions for missed approach that are different from the published missed approach procedure it is always possible for you to select different direct to way point than the default direct to way point the aircraft approaches tx you will need to select obs mode to stop way point sequencing and define the inbound course for the holding pattern if you do not select the obs mode before the aircraft is within nm of the holding point then the kln presents message reminding you to select the obs mode note another attempt at the approach is desired after holding itis necessary to manually change the active way point when the fa and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active way point to the fa when you change from obs to leg make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active mode example approach radar vectors for this example we will use the same approach that was used in the previous section except this approach will be conducted with the help of radar vectors from approach control the aircraft will be assumed to be arriving from the west although this does not change the way the approach will be flown using the kln approach has been selected and entered into the flight plan and the aircraft is going direct to kc vn new mexico municipal as described in section soon as atc mentions radar vectors you should immediately start to think of the obs mode once given radar vectors change the active way point to tx and select the obs mode note that it is not important what order these events take place it is just as effective to change to obs mode and then change the active way point as it is to change the active way point and then switch to obs mode change the selected course on the cdi or hsi to the final approach course for this exam ple the inbound course is is now possible to watch your progress on the nav page and anticipate when you will be given new headings to fly established on the inbound course you will need to change back to the leg mode to allow for proper approach operation and automatic leg sequencing for best performance the change back to leg mode should be made before the aircraft is nm from the fa it is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the fa as the active way point before crossing the fa to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale factor the cdi scale fac tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the fa delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor change this will make the transition more abrupt if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active mode rest of this approach would be flown using the same steps as presented in section and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid example approach on navaid another common type of approach is an approach that is based onan on navaid these could be either vor or ndb approach es an example of this type of approach is the vor rwy approach to bowman airport in louisville kentucky the airport identifier for this airport is lou approaches and sid and sid this example assume that the aircraft is approaching lou from the nabb vor passing the nabb vor you are told to expect the vor approach at lou you load the approach using the procedure described in section the distance from the present position to the destination airport reaches nm the kln will automatically arm the approach mode the cdi scale factor will transition to nm and the kln will provide more sensitive integrity monitoring you also press to update the barometric information the aircraft is nm from the qm vor the kln will give message reminding you to select the obs mode the obs mode is required for the procedure turn after passing qm select the outbound course of the external cdi or hsi aircraft is now headed outbound for the procedure turn as soon practical you will need to change the active way point to ff the final approach fix this is done by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning until ff is displayed in the win dow then pressing then pressing the obs course will still be what is select ed on the external cdi or hsi the obs mode selected and ff as the active way point it is possible to fly the procedure turn allow enough distance past ff to complete the procedure turn and still be nm away before reaching the fa after completing the outbound portion of the procedure turn change the selected course to the inbound course of the external cdi or hsi established on the inbound course the leg mode will again need to be selected so that proper approach operation and way point sequencing will occur is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the fa as the active way point before crossing the fa to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale factor the cdi scale fac tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the fa delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale apt vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th kln pilot guide approaches and sid and sid change this makes the transition more abrupt if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active mode the aircraft is nm from the fa the kln will verify that the proper gps integrity is available if integrity monitoring is available for the approach then the kln will change to the approach active mode this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to nm way point alerting will occur as the aircraft passes the final approach fix the leg from the final approach fix to the missed approach point will become active and the cdi scale factor will remain at nm if the auto scale factor was selected on the nav page then the scale factor will zoom in on the airport as the aircraft gets closer and closer to the missed approach point eventually the map scale changes to nm following steps are followed if missed approach is required missed approach instructions call for climbing left turn to heading of intercepting the course to the missed approach holding fix scum to fly this with the kln it will be necessary to put the kln into the obs mode and make scum the active way point change the selected course on the external cdi or hsi to the aircraft reaches scum you will need to perform holding pattern entry suitable for this holding pattern and set the selected course to the holding pattern example approach dme arc dme arc procedures with the kln are completely different from using traditional vor and dme equipment don worry though because dme arc procedures using the kln are also easier than using traditional equipment this is because the kln pro vide left guidance around the arc no more having to watch distance in one place and radial in another being vectored dme arc is really whole bunch of initial approach fixes placed one next to each other to form an arc very rarely do you actually fly to the beginning of an arc especially in radar environment instead the flight path of the aircraft generally intersects the arc at some point once the aircraft is near the arc it is then possible to turn so that the arc distance is maintained until time to turn to the inbound fix following example will show how dme arc procedures are flown using the kln this example approach will be to use the vor rwy approach to owatonna minnesota kow the approach plate for this approach is in figure assume that the aircraft is approaching from the north and is in radar environment assigns the vor rwy approach turn to the apt page for kow to select the approach you select the vor approach and the kln pre sents the iaf selection page are five choices for the iaf three of these choices you can recognize but the other two and are un amil ar and not shown on this chart these two way points are the data base identifiers for the ends of the arc means dme arc point is the radial on which the way point lies and indi cates the distance of the arc is the twelfth letter of the alphabet so the indicates that this is dme arc in similar manner can also be decoded in this example the aircraft is approaching from the north so the iaf will be selected kln knows that this point is associated with dme arc once an arc way point is chosen the kln determines what radial of the reference vor the aircraft is presently located on way point is created that is located at the intersection of the pre sent radial and the dme arc this way point is the first way point in the list of way points presented on the apt page before loading approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the approach into the flight plan this way point is named using the same con ven tion discussed earlier the present radial from the reference vor is outside of the defined arc then the kln will default to the beginning of the arc pilot guide approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure caution the kln does not take into account the geom try of the active flight plan when determining the arc intercept point this point is defined solely on the present radial and the defined arc distance from the reference vor for this reason it is better to delay selecting approaches that contain dme arcs until the aircraft is closer to the destination the cursor over add to pl press the approach will be loaded into the active flight plan just like any other approach would be the approach is loaded into the flight plan the kln may give the message pts in pl edit en route pts as necessary this message is given because very often it will be necessary toed it the active flight plan to ensure that proper way point seq enc ing occurs examine the flight plan and if practical observe the nav page to make sure that the sequence of way points does not have any unnecessary legs in it kln will now provide guidance to the arc intercept point the nav page displays the entire arc on the screen the por tion that is between the beginning of the arc and the arc intercept is drawn with dashed line the part that is between the arc inter ept point and the end of the arc is drawn with the normal solid line some cases atc may provide radar vectors to the arc the kln provides means to define new intercept point based on the current track of the aircraft over the ground this can be done from either the nav page or from the pl page the dashed line displayed on the nav page will help you to deter mine if atc is giving you correct vectors the nav page pull out the right inner knob to bring up the way point scanning window the right inner knob until the first way point of the arc is displayed in this example for approaches this will have small appended to the way point name if the recalculation is to be done from the pl page then turn on the cursor and move it over the first way point of the arc and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure either page press this will change the way point to read move if it is desired to recompute the arc intercept point then press if new arc intercept point is not desired then press again was pressed then the kln will calculate an arc intercept point based on the present track of the aircraft over the ground note the present track does not intercept the arc then the kln will display no in tcp tin the scratchpad area of the screen the aircraft approaches the arc the kln will provide way point alerting and turn anticipation to join the arc established on the arc the kln provides left guid ance relative to the curved arc distance to the active way point is the distance from the present position to the active way point not the distance along the arc refer to appendix for the geometry of the arc the arc the desired track will be constantly changing to help you keep the orientation correct the nav page will auto mat ically display tk on the fourth line it is not possible to change this to something else while on the arc the value dis played for the desired track will flash when the difference between the cdi or hsi and the current desired track is greater than dme arcs have defined radials that serve as step down fixes these points are not stored in the data base to help you determine your position relative to these step points along the arc the kln will display new value in the bottom right corner of the display on the nav page this new bit of inform tion is denoted by the letters arc followed by three numbers three numbers represent the current radial that you are on relative to the reference vor the arc radial is forced into this position when the aircraft is nm from the arc the arc display is shown in figure just watch this value and when it reads the same as one of the step points you can descend as necessary this particular example does not have such points but there are quite few approaches that do pilot guide approaches and sid and sid vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and sid and sid performance may not be satisfactory if coupled in the nav mode while flying the arc many autopilots were never designed to fly curved paths if autopilot performance is not satis fac tory while flying dme arcs select the hd mode and keep changing the heading bug to keep the centered

there will be problem with the integrity of the gps sy tem while you are conducting non approaches with the kln in some cases the kln will determine that there will not be sufficient integrity monitoring for the leg between the fa and the map or aim is not currently available in these cases the kln will not go into the approach active mode and will present the follow ing message not available apr mode inhibited predict aim on th these cases you will not be able to finish the approach because there is insufficient integrity monitoring the th page provides means for you to predict when aim will be available to perform aim prediction on the th page two pieces of in for ation are needed the first is the location that the prediction will be for and the second is the time for the prediction destination way point will by default be the missed approach point of an approach loaded in the flight plan if there is no approach in the flight plan then the default way point is the last way point in the active flight plan of course it is possible for you to enter any way point in this field time used for the aim prediction will be the current eta to the destination airport or the map this time is automatically updated by the kln so there is usually no need to enter value if you are making aim calculation for planning purposes it is also possible to enter time in this field an important point about this time is that the time used for aim prediction is always in the future and limited to hours from the present time for example if the time is now and the time entered for the eta is then the prediction will be made for the next day not one hour ago pilot guide approaches and sid and sid to perform manual aim calculation the left outer and inner knobs to select the th page

terminal arrival routes by sid name sid procedures stored in the data base can only be considered accurate as long as the data base is current even though the data base contains sid and star procedures there is lot of information that is not included in the data base therefore the paper chart is still the primary source of information for example many procedures require the aircraft to fly to certain altitude along heading until intercepting course and many other procedures that the kln can not automatically accomplish many procedures require pilot action to ensure that the proper path is flown over the ground the main purpose of loading sid or star into the active flight plan is to provide you with quick way of loading potentially large number of way points and star procedures can be as challenging to fly as some approaches are therefore it is mandatory that you are comfortable with the operation of the kln before attempting to fly sid and star procedures in particular flight plan operation and the obs mode should be second nature to you note are some sid procedures in the world that are not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base and therefore the way points that make up these procedures would have to be entered manually it is good preflight practice ensure that the kln con tains anticipated procedures for the flight and star procedures are stored with the airport for which they apply sid and star procedures are accessed through the apt page if there are both sid and stars for given airport then there will be two apt pages one to select sid and the other to select star this is indicated by apt it is also possible to have only sid or only star in which case there is only one apt page pilot guide approaches and sid and sid sid and star procedures are defined in three parts the parts are the sid or star name porte transition fellows and runway specific component rw the apt pages lead you through the selection process selecting sid use the following procedure to select sid some steps may not be necessary depending on the procedure that you wish to fly for this example the porte nine departure from san francisco international will be used select sid ksf on one of the airport pages if you are operating from an active flight plan you can use the act page for ksf by

difficult that you are likely to come across most procedures are not this difficult but this sid serves as good example for what steps to take when you encounter difficult procedure fly this procedure use the following steps and refer to the chart for this sid the sid as described in section procedure states and proceed via sfo the dme fix at or above to accomplish this por of the sid put the kln

example is the same as is the same as conversions appendix appendix gps primer background the global positioning system is satellite navigation system that was originally conceived and implemented by the united states department of defense the system is however avail able to all civilian users free of charge gps provides extremely precise position velocity and time information satellites are not geosynchronous as is the case with many weather and television satellites that is each satellite is not above fixed spot on the earth all the time but rather is continuously moving across the sky in fact each satellite completely orbits the earth two times per day department of defense imposes an intentional accuracy de gra of the gps system this degradation is known as selective availability when sa is active only military users have access to full gps accuracy for civilian users position accuracy is degraded to no worse than meters at the time of this writing selective availability is on therefore accuracy is degraded near ly of the time position determining concept the technique used to determine position is fundamentally very sim the complicated part is accounting for and correcting all the possible errors in the position gps receiver is able to determine the time it takes radio signal to travel from the satellite to the gps antenna since this radio signal travels at the speed of light statute miles per second the time delay can very easily be used to determine the receiver distance from given satellite if measurements are taken from four satellites three satellites and an input from an aircraft altimeter the receiver can identify its position very precisely pilot guide appendix primer appendix for example the gps receiver might determine that it is exactly miles from satellite miles from satellite and miles from satellite at the same time the aircraft en cod altimeter might be indicating an altitude of feet msl there is only one point in space that satisfies these four measurements data signals two of the primary types of signals that the gps satellites broadcast are almanac and ephemeris data these signals enable the gps receiver to quickly lock on to the satellites in view otherwise the receiver would have to look for each of the satellites to determine which ones could be used data is very crude data which describes the approximate orbital position of the satellites each of the satellites transmits the almanac data for all satellites so gps receiver has only to listen to one satellite in order to know which satellites are the sky at that particular time almanac data is good for about six months so when you turn the receiver off then back on month later it will know what satellites to look for data is very precise data which each satellite transmits to tell the gps receiver exactly where it is and what its orbital para me ter will be for about the next four hours each satellite transmits its own unique ephemeris data ff primer appendix nm nm nm ft msl not to calen gps system segments the gps system is composed of three segments the space segment the control segment and the user segment space segment consists of the nav star satellites which orbit the earth at an altitude of nautical miles the satellite orbits are very precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the gps system hours day every day there are almost always more than six satellites in view from anywhere on earth control segment consists of network of ground monitor and control stations the master control station is located in colorado springs colorado all satellite data which is collected by the other ground stations is assimilated and analyzed at colorado springs based on these analyses ephemeris updates as sy tem clock corrections are sent to the satellites through radio transmitters at the ground stations these ground stations are located at kwajalein of hawaii in the central pacific ocean diego garcia the indian ocean and ascension the south atlantic ocean an owner of gps system you can now claim to be certified member of the gps user segment gps has many users and uses and more are being dreamed up all the time not only are aircraft using gps navigation so are military systems and personnel boaters hikers and surveyors personal automobiles and transport trucks use intelligent transportation systems or its to find their destinations and track their movements some biologists attach gps receivers to animals to monitor their movement and migration patterns geologists even use gps to track the movement of lac ers and to analyze plate tectonics of the earth crust an exciting new technology as we move into the century autonomous integrity monitoring is function that every ifr gps receiver must continuously perform to assure an accurate position one characteristic of the gps space and control segments is that they can instantly fix satellite if it begins sending misleading positioning information for this reason gps receiver can rely on the gps satellites to tell it when there is pos error the words autonomous indicate that the gps kln pilot guide appendix primer appendix receiver on it own can detect an inaccuracy in the gps system it does this by using distance measurements from as many satellites as possible to check the consistency of the position is called an over position solution there are not enough satellites in view to assure the position in te gri the kln notifies the pilot five measurements with good geometry positions of the satellites are needed to provide aim this means that at least five satellites or four satellites and pressure altitude input from the aircraft altimeter are required to assure aim availability likewise if this check shows some in con sistency in the position the kln notifies the user that other navigation sources should be used to cross the position additionally sometimes the receiver is unable to assure the position to enough accuracy for the phase of flight due to the location of the satellites at that instant availability is very seldom difficulty when in the en route and terminal phases of navigation the allowable limits are much tighter when non approach is performed with kln for this reason the kln other page allows the pilot to enter time and location and the gps receiver will predict if aim will be available to shoot the non approach see section for more information about the aim prediction capability press receiver the kln and kln use an honeywell gps receiver known as the gps press it was dubbed this way because it is ident cal in size to an everyday credit card and its faster acquisition time than previous single designs the gps receiver has eight parallel channels which means each channel can continuously track satellite for continuous tracking of up to eight gps satellites the parallel receiver design has several advantages performance during high dynamic conditions and acceleration position acquisition time known as time over single designs position accuracy ability of the gps receiver to perform the aim calc ula tion is enhanced without degrading position tracking

qualification training and checking as well as for the relevant portion of conversion training and checking the course was verified to fulfill the requirements of jar amc in an acceptable way this type rating training course is an intense and demanding course additional training should be considered for pilots without any previous experience with efis and fms the safe operation of the airplane is predicated upon the awareness at all times and of both pilots of the airplane flight modes and flight parameters strict adherence to crew coordination procedures in normal as well as in abnormal situations is essential and should be regarded as mandatory these ccp specific to aircraft type and to operator should be fully integrated in the training the training organization therefore should be made aware of the specific crew coordination procedures as established by the operator before training is started pilots having no relevant experience with the app li cation of crew coordination proc dures will benefit from bridge course on this topic pilots having no relevant experience with the operation of an integrated avionics flight management system and flight guidance system like the collins pr suite will benefit from bridge on this topic these specific additional courses should ideally be completed before the full flight simulator training phase emergency procedures are an essential part of the training curriculum to avoid confusion during training as well as during actual operations the training organization and the candidate pilots need to be made aware of the items to be performed without immediate reference to the checklist these steps should be defined before training is started preferably by the operator as part of its standard operating procedures further areas of special emphasis are covered in separate paragraph eas recommends to include line flying under supervision in the conversion training program and to follow the requirements of eu including

previous efis or fms experience establishing ear ly confidence in manually flying the aircraft converting from manual to automatic controlled flight mode and back is equally important due to heavy reliance on the automatic flight control system in the event of flight path deviation due to input error or system malfunction the flight crew must be able to comfortably transition from automatic to manual mode and back in an orderly fashion european aviation safety agency aviation authorities joint operational evaluation board gulf stream issue september recurrent training recurrent training and currency serve to maintain pilot continued competency for the operational tasks to be performed during proficiency checks this competency is established it is every operator responsibility to establish recurrent training and proficiency checking program approved by the national authority which is relevant to the type of airplane and the intended operation the requirements for recurrent training program may vary with several factors which have significant influence some of these factors are actu al exposure of the flight crew member specific routes and aerodromes used by the operator and new developments in technology these factors and combination thereof will determine how much recurrent training will actually be required it is recommended to follow the requirements of eu subpart

the problem brief overview of how the project research and analysis were conducted and list of the significant findings and recommendations readers and front line managers who may need or want more details of the problem research and analysis and complete listing of findings and recommendations can refer to the full report that follows the go noncompliance problem approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for aviation accidents accounting annually for approximately percent of all accidents flight safety foundation study of years of runway excursions determined that percent could have been avoided with decision to go around in other words percent of all accidents could potentially be prevented by going around it is generally felt that an unstable approach is the primary cause of landing excursions however within this period just over half of the landing excur followed fully stable approach in these instances the flight became unstable only during landing critical industry policy designed to help prevent such accidents is the go policy interestingly and sadly the collective industry performance of complying with go policies is extremely poor approximately percent of unstable approaches result in go policy compliance why is critical policy designed to prevent the most common type of accident ignored by flight crews and why is that policy not being managed effectively by management improving the go compliance rate holds tremendous potential in re approach and landing accidents the go itself is not without risk there is an increased risk in loss of control events during go compared to exposure with all other phases of flight it follows that we should only go around when the risk associated with an unstable approach is greater than the risk associated with go what is that balance and how do we minimize go exposure to only those that are really necessary the flight safety foun go decision making and execution project was launched to research and answer the question are we so poor at complying with established go policies it was also intended to improve our understanding of the risks associated with executing go and to make re com to improve compliance and mitigate risks assoc with the go maneuver itself the full report includes complete research analysis find strategies and recommendations for industry corrective action and future work required as such it is meant as source for the development of easier operator refer products such as guidelines and checklists research and analysis many alas have been investigated thoroughly over time and much is known about contributing factors what is lacking however is an understanding of the psychology of noncom pli research and analysis of go decision making have been conducted primarily from the psychosocial science perspective to gain an understanding of the psychological drivers of noncompliance and to identify corrective steps that can be taken based on science this is the first industry anal of its type for this specific problem the presage group conducted the research and analysis based on its situational model of nine distinct constructs or attributes from two global studies via web surveys one survey analyzed the psychology of noncompliance by flight crew members and the other examined the psychology of management actions in handling company go policies detailed analysis can be found in the full report for the go execution research an accident and incident review was conducted that included non selection of published accident and serious incident re about go events involving transport category aircraft between and total of go events were included in some the safety of the go was central to the accident or incident investigation in th the aftermath of the go was the main purpose of the investigation the events involved single jets percent twin turboprops percent and twin jets percent the context safety aspects and overall level of risk of each event were analyzed and characterized by review team each event was assigned to one of three categories according to the degree of risk presented by the go high risk events moderate risk events and non events in the two risk categories six go safety issues were identified with respect to the init ia and conduct of each go most of the risk bearing events were associated with single gas but five events were associated with two gas is each risk event also was assigned one of three risks loss of control flight controlled flight into terrain or midair collision significant findings an effective policy has three main attributes it is well thought out and clearly written to balance the needs of safety and accomplishment company management handles the policy consistently and company front line employees aware is such that the policy is carried out reliably research revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the industry operator and employee levels high significant findings are the collective industry norm is to accept the noncom pli of go polices despite empirical data that indicate this is the most common contributor to alas the industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable approaches as the sole means to reduce alas even though empirical data show that unstable approaches affect less than half of runway excursions pilots overall awareness of ala risks and of the impact those risks have on approach and landing safety is low management is generally disengaged from go noncompliance and has low awareness of the impact it has on alas management perception of risk is low pilots do not see current go policy criteria as realistic for the operational environment effective go decision making in flight deck com muni cation is low go although considered normal flight man eu are rare as reported by flight crews one in go has potentially hazardous outcome such as an aircraft per for exceed ance there are variable go techniques and challenges depending on the point during the approach when the go around begins procedures and training do not adequately address many of these challenges pilot experience in the aircraft type affects go proficiency go complexity including complex controller radio transmissions can affect go proficiency recommendations it is evident that the state of noncompliance has been steady for many years and will remain steady unless changes are made first and foremost the industry must improve its awareness of the problem shift in focus and cultural norms is required it is believed that significant improvement is attainable however the cultural shift will be easier if the industry shifts collectively as opposed to individual comp attacking the issue on their own as several are already doing as stated above three key attributes of an effective policy are the policy makes operational sense to both the employees who execute it and those who manage it the policy is managed effectively to level that satisfies company objectives and the employees who should follow the policy are very aware of that policy and the environment in which it is applied as such the following recommendations touch upon these key attributes more detailed recommendations can be found in the full report high strategic recommendations for go decision making include the following ensure the policy makes sense operationally update the stable approach definition and stable ap height to maximize their relevance among flight crews and their manageability among management separate the stable approach definition and criteria from decision criteria to improve aware that these are two distinct aspects of go policies and that decision making is viable beyond the defined approach phase this separation does not imply that these two distinct areas cannot meet at points throughout the approach and landing rather it is intended for developers of standard operating pro ce dures and communication procedures to break the psychological attachment of these two aspects manage the policy effectively operators set specific compliance rate targets performance indicators and establish initiatives to achieve them amend industry and regulatory audit programs to include standards and recommended practices that address go noncompliance increase situational awareness increase awareness of gan and risks associated with continuing to land when unstable and the significant impact that noncompliance has on alas among operator management ii flight crews iii industry and pilot associations regulators and manufacturers enhance situational awareness aware to heighten flight crews awareness throughout the approach and landing through policy and procedural enhancements communication improvements and iii minimizing the subjectivity of go decision making for the decision maker the pilot flying or captain to mitigate those components of situ awareness that compromise the pilot risk assessment and decision ability each recommendation helps improve the psychological riv that affect good decision making and it is this obj ec that the recommendations were specifically designed to address although all strategic recommendations are important and should be implemented as part of holistic approach few are worth highlighting first if an operator has the means to install automated stable approach and land alerting systems it should be priority these systems address many of the psychological issues associated with noncompliance and could be the single most effective way to improve go decisions second management must be more involved in managing the policy an area where management has been very much absent key steps to be taken by management are to set go compliance rate targets consistent with safety management system prin and to investigate and follow up on each approach that continues to an unstable landing finally flight crew situational awareness needs to be improved primarily through better communication throughout the approach and landing which can be achieved largely through active communication techniques as part of standard opera procedures high strategic go execution recommendations ensure that go training and awareness appro pri reflect different go execution risk scenarios review go policy procedures and ocu men to maximize their effectiveness clarity and understanding ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitoring during approach landing and go as with any significant program change desired and undesired effects should be closely monitored by appro pri audit programs such as flight data analysis line operations safety audits or international air trans association operational safety audits action taken in light of the findings and recommendations it is appar that revisions are required to flight safety foundation elements of stabilized approach and safe landing guidelines analysis indicates there are facets of that guidance that are not optimal for effective decision making and that may encourage go for approaches that may be of very low risk when this report was being published the analysis for such revisions had already taken place but the project review committee recommended an operational trial before changes in the foundation guidelines are formally adopted appendices and for flight safety foun stabilized approach and go guidelines for industry validation and safe landing guidelines for industry validation project conclusion report the problem of go policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the greatest threat to flight safety today and the po impact of improvement in compliance is significant no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go around the industry must improve its awareness of the problem to accomplish that shift in focus and cultural norms is required it is believed that significant improvement is attain however the cultural shift will be much easier if the in shifts collectively as opposed to individual companies taking individual action however several companies already have chosen to go it alone on this issue the project accomplished the goals of the document that outlined the terms of flight safety foundation go safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight crew members and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight managers and to consider the safety risk assoc with go and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of the report not all envisioned products have been completed however and this is noted in the report as work yet to be done by flight safety foundation background curtis william ia meeting boeing seattle presentation in flight safety foundation international advisory committee was briefed about concerns that go around often were not being conducted when an unstable approach occurred below the stable approach height the ensuing discussion concluded in agreement that the issue should be studied further interestingly the foundation eu advisory committee began its own discussion related to go the lack of unstable approach policy compliance the risk of the go maneuver itself and what effect air traffic services providers could have on the issue these discussions led the foundation to look more deeply into the empirical data supporting such concerns failure to conduct go is the number one risk factor in approach and landing accidents and the number one cause of runway excursions the year in review recent analyses of data from through indicate that percent of all accidents are runway excursions and that they are the most common type of accident the year in review unstable approaches occur on to percent of all approaches and to percent of flight crews whose airplanes are in this state continue the approach to landing the year in review evidence based training in of approach and landing accidents and serious incidents one of several studies conducted by flight safety foundation approach and landing accident reduction task force and published by the foundation in the task force con an in analysis of accidents and incidents that occurred from through the task force found that go was initiated in only percent of the occurrences and said that the evidence analysts expected the initiation of higher number of go in practice safety foundation alar task force approximately percent of all accidents are alas curtis one analysis concluded that more than percent of alas would have been preventable if the crew had decided to go around the year in review simply calculated potentially about half of all accidents could be prevented with decision to go around no other single de can have such an impact on the overall aviation accident rate although all of these studies are somewhat subjective the consistencies from study to study indicate the problem is real and is of the magnitude the studies indicate clearly go around decision can yield great benefits but what about the risks associated with the go maneuver itself there is no shortage of informative studies that have ana what occurred during alas and what factors contrib to the accidents however no known study has examined flight crew decision making from psychological perspective to determine why some crews continued with an unstable approach knowingly violating company policies and why th elected to go around what are the drivers of intentional noncompliance with critical safety policy the alar task force analysis of approach and landing accidents and serious incidents identified professional judgment decision making as the most re casual factor occurring in percent of the events another form of poor decision making or continuing an approach when conditions suggest otherwise accounted for percent of all occurrences safety foundation alar task force more questions arise about the actions or inactions of company management in these events if the data have been consistent for many years why have managers not been able to correct the problem with such low industry compliance rate some basic questions about management role need to be answered are they aware of the noncompliance rates and if so then why have they been unable to mitigate or improve compliance with established go policies if they are not concerned with the poor compliance rate why not man issues were not cited in any of the conclusions of the alar task force final of fatal approach and landing accidents however in the task force conclusions of related study of approach and landing ac and serious incidents management fail was identified as circumstantial factor in percent of the occurrences safety foundation alar task force based on these analyses better awareness of the problem and new questions flight safety foundation initiated the go decision and execution project it was designed as joint ea project with each committee focusing on one specific aspect of the issue the ia focused on go decision making and the ea focused on the performance of the go go decision making flight crew methodology and information collection the presage group was commissioned by flight safety foun to conduct research and analysis on the psychology of factors contributing to intentional noncompliance the basis for much of the following comes from two studies conducted by presage one that analyzed the psychology of flight crew decision making during unstable approaches and another that analyzed the psychology of company management decision making pertaining to addressing noncompliance with com go safety policies jamieson and curtis why are go policies ineffective the syc ology of de making during unstable approaches jamieson and curtis why are go policies ineffective the view from the airline manager desk although the issue extends beyond unstable approaches the studies were conducted on this phase of flight as data were readily attainable from flight crews psychological survey was developed that used unique questioning and experimental methodologies to understand the causation of compliant versus noncompliant flight crew go decision making these techniques included assess pilots experiences using series of questions designed to explore the psychological precursors of risk assessment and decision making second survey was designed to assess the perceptions beliefs and experiences of airline man ag and safety and operational personnel regarding unstable approaches and how they are managed at their host comp to fully understand the systemic roots and dynamics of noncompliance with unstable approach policies across the industry the results of the managers study were compared with those of the parallel flight crew study flight crew event recall study segmentation in this segment of the study we asked pilots to recall recent specific instances of unstable approaches at or below sah we asked for the last instance they had experienced this special recall task elicited detailed descriptions of their experiences during the minutes leading up to and including decision on whether to call for go these experiences include subjective aspects their situational and risk assessments felt social pressures fatigue beliefs about their companies go policies etc as well as their psychological representations of the objective factors characterizing the aircraft and the environment during their approaches flight instabilities visual reference co ndi environmental and air traffic control factors etc these variables constitute full and in recounting of the objective factors and their resulting psychological states during the critical time interval leading up to the decisions states that were hypothesized to be the highly important precursors of those decisions in addition to help refine the analysis pilots also reported variety of basic demographic information rank time on type base of operations etc and flight operational characteristics haul versus short haul operations aircraft type etc the content of the entire survey was thoroughly reviewed commented upon and amended in accordance with the recommendations made by members of the ia and ea and other expert advisory team members the pilots were divided into groups those who only experienced continuing to land with an unstable approach group those who only experienced go group and those who had experienced both go and unstable approach events pilots in this group were randomly as to one of two groups to recall scenario in which they had flown an unstable approach but did not call for go or to recall go event this random experimental assignment allowed us to conf identify objective and psychological situational factors associated with noncompliance with go policies re go decision making pilots who reported they had only flown go or an unstable approach recently in the last five years recalled their last event of those respective types the main set of psychological and psychosocial factors assessed was

operationally compliant decision making pilot go thresholds study segmentation second experiment was included in this survey and we report some findings below but the details are too nu mer to fully describe here this experiment was designed to uncover the environmental and physical instability param that influence pilots perceptions of the risks inherent in flying unstable approaches and to examine when their attention to these parameters affects their judgments about when to call for go in this study pilots were pre with hypothetical flight scenario in which they were randomly assigned to receive variations in the severity of the risk associated with wind conditions runway conditions braking action and runway length they were then asked at what degree of deviation on five different flight parameters those variations would cause them to call for go pilots were instructed to report on their likelihood of calling for go based on their own personal risk criteria not those of their companies or of the industry on this set of five flight parameters and to do so at different altitudes this allowed us to infer where on the flight path different risk factors become personally salient and important as drivers of pilots judgments to go around and how these factors might interact the objective was to determine whether there was basic alignment between pilots perce about when there is need to call for go and general company policies about when these instabilities necessitate such decision in case of evidence of any gaps between these two our goal was to use these data to guide realistic recommendations about changes in policy that might bring them into alignment while ensuring that safety would not be compromised to the extent that pilots do not see current policies as constituting set of legitimately unsafe conditions they are likely to ignore such standard opera procedures and engage in potentially riskier noncom pli flight behaviors this was an experimentally based attempt to explore pilot perceptions of what should constitute the conditions to go around in their experienced judgment and to begin to develop view about whether such beliefs could be or should be incorporated into policy guidance and sops in way that would help ensure compliant safe behavior pilot respondent sampling respondents to this survey were solicited through direct communication with safety personnel at various pilot ass and fsf and non airlines globally as well as through various social media forums the goal was to invite and administer the online survey to as many pilots as possible from around the world representing variety of fleets aircraft flight operations respondent experience levels cultures physical geographies and so on anonym was assured to inspire honest and complete self of pilots experiences as well as to stimulate participation the pilots who completed the survey included those with good range of pilot experience on variety of opera

can be generalized to pilots world management study in this study we asked safety managers at major airlines those with the authority to recommend or enact changes in unstable approach criteria and policy as well as those responsible for day quality control of flight op series of questions regarding their views of the safety practices procedures and organizational cultures with which unstable approaches and go occur in their own airline operations specifically we asked such managers about the rates of compliance with unstable approach policies that they believed their airlines experienced as well as the compliance rates experienced by the commercial industry as whole beyond this basic knowledge we asked whether they were satisfied with their airline performance on comp li with their unstable approach policies and procedures and whether they thought them effective about their perceptions of the clarity and appropriateness of these policies and procedures about their beliefs that they had the support support and organizational approval to manage their company go rates and about their overall assessment of how urgently they believed that the risks any perceived in their go rates needed to be addressed at all the content of the entire survey was thoroughly reviewed commented upon and amended in ac with the recommendations made by members of the ia the ea and other expert advisory team members as in the pilot study the main set of psychological and psychosocial factors assessed were included in different set of nine facets of awareness situational awareness in

air transport association and airlines for america as well as by several airlines anonymity was assured to inspire honest and complete self reports of managers beliefs and opinions as was true of the pilot sample with the managers who completed the survey we achieved wide geographical representation suggesting that our results can perhaps be generalized to management personnel worldwide however several caveats are explained below in fact the distributions by gender continent and language in the managers sample were nearly identical to those in the pilots sample while few directors completed the survey there were sizeable number of mid and senior managers in the sample however subsequent question about respondents roles and responsibilities within their airlines for re com and leading

development or implementation the considerable efforts that we made in our outreach and engagement strategy for the survey garnered unique visits to the survey portal we consider this number of hits to be very good indicating that the engagement strategy drove meaningful number of airline managers to the site however of those visiting only percent completed the survey response rate low in both absolute terms and relative to the rate of participation among pilots percent who were asked to complete much longer and more demanding survey this low response rate constitutes we believe the first evidence pointing toward disengagement with the topic of unstable approach policy and procedures among airline flight operations personnel at the managerial level this is especially true when we consider that the original criterion for inclusion in our final analysis stipulated that respondents must be in position to develop and influence unstable approach go policies and procedures at their airlines by virtue of their authority to recommend or make changes based on this inclusion criterion and an analysis of respondents self reported roles and responsibilities we achieved sample of only qualified re spon to increase the sample size for analysis we widened the sample frame to include those respondents responsible for quality control of day flight operations at their airlines even if they did not have policy development responsibilities thorough comparison of the latter group with the original target revealed no systematic differences in their survey responses justifying their inclusion in the final sample the study therefore reports the results from managers per of all survey respondents and percent of survey site visitors this low response rate essen disallowed us from analyzing data for second experimental task of determining personal go around thresholds for unstable approach risk among managers similar to the pilots go threshold experiment meanwhile in light of the low response rate caveat must be issued for all other results that we report below that is because the normative response to the survey invitation among managers worldwide was to choose not to participate therefore we must question whether this was valid and reliable sample of managers that said the results although based on this small sample are highly suggestive of trends in managers perspectives on unstable approach policies and procedures while we are unsure if the sample is in fact biased our intuition tells us that any sample bias if present would tend toward having surveyed managers who are more engaged aware and concerned about the issue than those who are less so if this is true these results may more likely over the degree of awareness and concern about unstable approach around noncompliance that exists in the industry industry sensing throughout the project there have been numerous dis with operators regulators manufacturers and bodies and conference and meeting present with follow conversations off accounts from agencies not wishing to be identified indicate that of those that have tracked go compliance rates are in the range of those discussed above to percent and that they have been in that range for protracted period of time the exceptions are couple of airlines that indicated their go around compliance rates approach percent additionally they say that their flight data acquisition programs are set to report out when the number of stable approach parameter exceed ance is greater than one the federal aviation administration aviation safety

condition or unstable approach because they had recently experienced only that one type of event findings from comparison of these groups are conservative and represent situationally important factors associated with go decision making not pilot dispositional factors however pilot tendencies and preferences associated with flying unstable approaches are of course present in the aviation community and we will also point out in the data how such pilot di sposi factors may additionally contribute to noncompliance with go sops it is our belief that the best way to present the findings is to describe how pilots noncompliant behavior is function of decision process influenced by the in aircraft and environmental factors that shape pilots decisions their situational awareness competencies in encoding and inter the cues they receive about these aircraft and env factors their personal perceptions of risk and risk tolerance that result and their appetite for appropriate col conversation about risk during the approach as an input to decision making it is from both the pilots responses within each of these four classes of variables as well as the interactions between the two pilots that complete de scrip psychological profile for noncompliance emerges pilot situational awareness profile situational awareness of his or her environment in all its facets is the psychological prerequisite for pilot to judge risk and then to make decision to maintain compliance and safety in light of that judgment this study used the pre group situational awareness model for measuring and interpreting the psychological and social factors that col make up situational awareness recall that within this model situational awareness comprises nine distinct but interconnected and seamless aspects of awareness much of our discussion will be framed around how each of these aspects influences pilot decision processes singly and in concert with one another to remain compliant rather than noncompliant note in passing that the presage model classifies with an average percent accuracy whether pilots are describing an unstable approach and landing or go percent for unstable approaches and percent for go based only on its psychosocial measurements and excluding any knowledge of the objective factors present in the unstable approach scenarios reported this means that our assessment of the experience of aware as we have measured it does good job of predicting pilots decision behavior far beyond percent chance level of prediction the results of this study revealed as hypothesized that on all nine inter situational awareness factors unstable approach pilots were significantly less aware than go pilots in the moments leading up to and including their go around decision making that is they were less aware of their emotional responses to threat less able to anticipate risk more overconfident in their ability to compensate for the instability and in less agreement with company sops etc in other words the unstable approach pilots scored much lower than did the go pilots on every facet of situational awareness assessed seven of these nine differ held up statistically to the more rigorous analysis that compared just the experimentally assigned go and un approach pilots with one another and eight of the nine differences between the experimentally assigned go and unstable approach pilots were even more pronounced when comparing the ga and ua groups it is meaningful to ask does this awareness shape pilot perception of risk put simply pilot situational awareness competencies directly affect his or her perceptions and assessment of risk the lower the degree of threat that pilots associate with instability and environmental factors the perception of which is directly informed by their situ awareness the lower the significance that pilots will place on the contributing factors and the less risky they will perceive the situation to be table shows this result with unstable approach pilots reporting much lower assess of the riskiness and unmanageability of their inst bili than go pilots the spreading activation effect of situational awareness competencies we have asserted that the inter nature of the facets of situational awareness means that decline in one facet will produce rapid deleterious effect on the others this becomes clear when we consider the data relevant to this activation effect of situational awareness facets for example this cross effect is evident among the unstable approach pilot groups whose lower scores on their gut feel for threats as well as on actually seeing the threats leave them vulnerable to minimizing both their assessment of the potential threat of aircraft instability and their ability to see the threat of instability as risk to be managed correctly the natural outcome is that more unstable approach pilots are unstable at sah corollary of these lower aware scores is that unstable approach pilots also score lower in their ability to leverage crew relationships to maximize compliance and safety table shows that unstable approach pilots are more likely to minimize efforts to consider and discuss with their crew members both instability factors path deviation aircraft ref kt sink rate and land configuration and environmental factors turbulence contaminated runway and occupied runway it is the culminating effect of the aforementioned reduced awareness competencies that leaves the unstable approach pilots vulnerable to adopting mental model that minimizes the risk of instability and reduces their attention to details as the results for the instruments and equipment and the procedures indicate functional and hierarchical awareness in table unstable approach pilots are more tolerant of deviations from operational limits and procedures and less compliant with requirements that they perform all checklists and standard calls moreover as these pilots commit to continuing with an unstable approach they minimize what their professional experience could offer in executing what the sop states table note on experience or critical awareness in other words when an unstable approach pilot is not tuned into salient inform from his or her experience bank he increases the risk profile of the operation and denies himself the opportunity to correctly adjust or compensate for the operational threat table to threats or compensatory awareness the finding that unstable approach pilots more often than go pilots report being unstable at sah confirms this missed opportunity to remain compliant in concert with the former pattern is the finding that unstable approach pilots were more comfortable operating on the margins of the safety envelope example in table note the lower scores on the limits or task empirical awareness which translates to greater tolerance for risk that is seen to be manageable in table note the assessment of the instability as risky if pilot is paying less attention to his situational awareness competencies he would likely also shut himself off from avail resources such as by using interpersonal relationships to protect operational safety and remain compliant table note each other safe or relational awareness there are number of significant findings at the gran level of this construct that tell meaningful story most notable among these is that unstable approach pilots are relatively more likely than go pilots to feel crew pre to land to perceive lack of crew support for possible go decision to feel discomfort in being challenged and in challenging others and to feel inhibited about calling for go because of the authority structure in the cockpit also go pilots are about four times more likely than unstable approach pilots percent vs percent to report recalling that an individual was prompting the crew to initiate ref is reference landing speed go the evidence is clear that rather than leveraging the crew relationships as tool for safe decision making crew roles expectations and communication had suboptimal even deleterious effect finally compounding this risk profile are the findings that unstable approach pilots score lower on support for safety and that fewer than percent of unstable approach pilots believed they would be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to land while at the same time maintaining that their company criteria for when to execute go are not realistic in the end for the unstable approach pilots there is less buy to company sops and an incentive structure that or is at least not seen to discourage unstable approaches that are continued to landing these results describe situation that creates internal conflict for the unstable approach pilots at least in hindsight when they express regret for their decision to continue an unstable approach to landing specifically compared with go pilots unstable approach pilots rated their flight outcomes less positively believed less often that they had made the right decision believed much more strongly than go pilots that they should not have made the decisions they did and finally agreed more strongly that they had engaged in needless risk interpretation of results the results appear to imply conflicting message from the unstable approach pilot group on one hand unstable ap pilots regret their decisions to continue an unstable approach and land knowing that they have taken risk and yet at the same time they don believe that the company criteria for go are realistic the latter may be in part rationalization of their noncompliant decision and one that they carry forward into the next such unstable approach situation at the moment of decision the potential for noncompliant behavior based on these beliefs is very pre while the chance seems remote that pilots may anticipate post regret for not calling for go and may have that anticipation inhibit their tendency to continue the unstable approach consider the psychosocial factors affecting unstable ap pilots at the time they need to make an appropriate decision on whether to go around they have lowered sense of situational awareness across most facets which has led them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their assessment of risk further their decision process re little help from protective crew norms and processes and there is no real disincentive to fly unstable approaches the expected company response to that decision these are the ingredients of recipe for the of deviance to contaminate this component of aviation safety culture essentially this term refers to the development of normal mode of operation which is passively support tolerated and approved by its stakeholder owners management and in some cases regula once entrenched within given culture this new mode power and authority can considerably influence behavior as evidenced in the challenger and columbia space shuttle tragedies supportive evidence from the results of this study indicates that in their acceptance of the noncom normal unstable approach pilots have surrendered level of situational awareness competency that directly impacts accurate risk assessment and full compliance with sops as published in short new norms roles and incentives have come to displace some of the influence that situational awareness should have in proximity to risk assessment and decision making pilot thresholds for going around another area for discussion is the second experimental part of the survey which asked pilots to describe their risk toler thresholds for various in parameters given set of flight and environmental conditions we found that braking action vs poor had particularly large impact on pi perception of the degrees of instability that warrant call for go on the whole however pilots thresholds for calling for go varied as function of both height agl and the instability parameter they were considering as reason for going around for several of these instability fac the perceived threshold occurred well below ft agl to in particular pilots said that they should be on profile at roughly ft agl and that they could com pen for instabilities for ref and sink rate later in the decent at around ft agl in another project analysis combined data from six north american airlines international jet airlines three regional jet airlines and one regional turboprop airline that are studying this problem independently show pilot responses to the question is the lowest altitude you believe safe go could be executed from with

data we can see significant altitude differences between the configuration of the aircraft and energy man and how the more challenging environmental con dition affect flight crews outlooks about when

levels of unstable approach risk full analysis of the objective levels of risk in each event recalled by the pilots is warranted to fully explain the he of broad noncompliance with go policies and sops the inherent risks associated with the percent of unstable approaches that continue unstable can only be indirectly inferred from the present methodology based on pilot self this study mainly assessed the psycho logi characteristics and attributes in situ of pilots who choose to continue unstable approaches to landing versus those who make decisions to go around the study does not segregate the various unstable approach scenarios into classes of env presenting high or low objective risks while it is understood that not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent risk the percent of unstable approaches that are flown to completion include the highest ap and these can result in accidents in the absence of definition of the objective level of risk associated with given approach pilots have only one set of criteria one definition of the instabilities and environmental threats that are expected to trigger go choice beyond this single definition it is up to the pilot to further determine pilot response scores to question what is the lowest altitude you believe safe go could be executed from variable conditions cumulative values ft ft ft ft threshold

environmental conditions are good reference landing speed values may be by rounding source the presage group for flight safety foundation what he or she perceives as safe and manageable level of risk this determination flows directly from his level and type of situational awareness and the mental models of risk he constructs based on that awareness to the extent that pilot has lowered situational awareness whether caused by acute aspects of the situation such as high workload or chronic aspects of the cultural environment such as lessened acceptance of the company go policy guidance or generally few challenges to cockpit command he will be less sensitive to relevant situational awareness cues and therefore be more likely to continue an unstable approach irrespective of the inherent objective risks associated with the approach these inadequately informed mental models of risk less accurately and sensitively represent the objective levels of the present threat as result they will not track re and will tend to produce an over of noncom decision making complete prescriptive policies vs predominately prescriptive policies complete prescriptive go policies and sops lend them to

landing distance available ref reference landing speed source the presage group for flight safety foundation and environmental threats that are expected to trigger go choice single set of criteria is often insufficient to cover all eventualities however as tony kern an aviator psychologist and author of several books on human behavior has said guidance is ef when it is thought out and fair written clearly explained thoroughly commonly understood and voluntarily complied with too many rules lead to cynicism and noncompliance and because not all situations can be anticipated rules cannot be developed to cover all possible developments in these cases the human ability to adapt to changing situations is just as important as the implementation of effective policies and procedures need to reach point where two types of professional discipline become second habits kern said first is the organizational discipline to keep the rules to an absolute minimum and enforce the rules across the board the second is the personal discipline to comply company policies too often he said policies and procedures conflict with cultural norms and when that happens who studies noncompliance knows that culture will nearly always trump policy at least in the long run not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent risk and based on the different objective environments from approach to approach there can be conflict between these and the singular prescriptive company go policy as in by the pilots disagreement with company go policy thresholds once pilot is outside the prescriptive box of go policy and has made the decision to continue the approach he is left to his individual risk assessment method whatever that may be to determine his personal risk thresh without guidance robust prescriptive policies that allow for some guided open analysis of risk and decision making can offer solution to these cases in which the objective env and stated policies do not align well for example if company go policy says that flight crew must go around in all cases if the aircraft has not touched down within seven seconds of crossing the threshold the pilots likely would view the importance of that policy dif depending on the conditions of the day they would likely be more in agreement with the policy for an approach to shorter runway that was contaminated and had slight tail wind than for an approach to longer dry runway with slight head wind if the policy is written to allow some devi from the seven requirement under some guiding principles pilots will agree with the policy more often in this example of the short contaminated runway the pre briefing should include statement that there would be no modification of the seven rule whereas in the case of the dry long runway the briefing may include an allowance to increase that time frame to seconds it is important to em that these allowances should follow guided process laid out by the company and that the policies remain pre do mi prescriptive in this example guiding principles may be that all crew members agree in advance of the modification and that the landing distance available exceeds the landing distance required by predetermined percentage allowing some guided decision making pilots will be more likely to trust and voluntarily comply with written policies in part because those policies will address the highly variable environments in which pilots work and also because the pilots will recognize that their expertise and real knowledge are being used in the risk process an increased agree on policy leads to increased buy and to the normalization of compliance stable approach criteria gates callout and decision points it is also worth discussing the relationship between the stable approach criteria the sah targets gates safe landing guidelines and decision points as the decision to go around remains possible up until the point of thrust deploy and go policies usually indicate that go should be initiated any time an aircraft becomes unstable below the sah then it follows that the decision point to go around defines the beginning of zone in which go is mandatory if the approach is unstable thrust reverser deployment defines the end of that zone most sop callout however channel flight crews to specific decision points to determine if they are in state in which it is safe to continue the approach these points are before thrust deploy these sop callout points are usually linked with sah leaving no formal stable callout for an extended period of time when go is viable active calls selection of calls that are mandatory for all varying objective conditions force communication between pilots passive or conditional calls on the other hand are only communicated if stimulated by condition the weakness in the passive call process is that if call is not made it could be for reasons other than the required objective condition being present for example if crew member did not see the condition call would not be made in addition crew member might choose not to make call for varying reasons such as subjective interpretation of the condition or fear of the cockpit authority structure active calls are always made and as stated they force com munic their absence indicates another problem such as pilot incapacitation many responsive callout by the pilot flying at sah or minimum approach height suggest what will happen what they are going to do for example suggestive calls like this to degree influence the decision to land and close the window for the decision to go around even though go may be required if the flight becomes unstable very late in the approach or landing repeated and escalated calls allow condition to remain alive in the conscious mind of the pilot on the other hand single callout for example at sah raises situational awareness about the condition at that moment as situational awareness is dynamic it can change quickly improving or worsening and callout that are designed to continue as long as the condition exists help to maintain awareness of that condition escalation of the calls can heighten awareness take the example of callout from enhanced ground proximity warning systems and other terrain awareness and warning systems the system alerts the flight crew to pending condition and continues with callout until the condition is no longer present the same effect can be ac com in unstable approach callout by both crew members and automated systems as the onset of approach instabilities can occur at any time even late in the landing phase keys to safe arrival the window for go decision follows that is the deci is not made at defined point at the sah the decision points for go are separate and distinct from the stable approach window and as such procedure designers can separate the two to maximize go decision making in reviewing the fsf alar task force elements of stabilized approach safety foundation alar task force we discover somewhat conflicting mes it states that approaches in instrument meteorological conditions must be stabilized before reaching ft agl visual meteorological conditions they must be stabilized before ft agl in precision non precision and visual approaches alike on the other hand the document indicates that descent below ft is acceptable in maneuver for circling approach and specifies that should be level on final when the aircraft reaches ft above airport elevation in other words on precision guided approach the documented guidance is that the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl in vmc and on circling non guided approach the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl it is not difficult for pilot to conclude that if it is acceptable and safe to fly off final approach profile until ft agl on non approach then it is also safe to fly an instrument approach to ft off profile although that is by definition unstable objective monitoring objective monitoring is that which does not require an individual to interpret information based on his or her ex or opinion it is usually factual information objective feedback in the cockpit minimizes the need for interpretation and can lead to more consistent and faster decision making additionally stating fact instead of interpreting inform making judgment or forming an opinion helps mini the effect of steep authority gradient in the cockpit such as may exist when low first officer is paired with high captain an example of objective feedback is that by an automated system such as egp ws in this case there is little subjective analysis done by the pilot when re to automated callout and the response can be quick and predictable this is in part why an automated energy management approach monitoring and alerting sy can be very effective in improving go compliance another example of the use of objective feedback is the use of radio altimeter automatic callout rather than interpreting radio altimeter readout information readouts can fluctuate due to terrain variances and must be observed and evaluated callout on the other hand are only heard in the absence of an automated energy management system after pilots cross the threshold they usually subjectively interpret or sense how much runway has passed by or how much remains from this they decide whether to conduct go if the pilot monitoring times the threshold crossing and then makes procedural call at the point where touchdown should occur or go should begin this call constitutes objective feedback to the pilot flying and makes clear that some either touchdown or go should occur should have occurred driven by policy and sops minimizing subjectivity in go decision pro is an objective that procedural designers should make every effort to achieve analysis management decision making overview of results in table we present data for managers self of their awareness of and if possible their specific estimates of both the industry and their own companies rates of compliance with unstable approach policy when asked whether they knew what the industry compliance rate was only percent of managers said that they did of those who claimed awareness however fewer were willing to estimate rate thirty managers percent of the participating offered an estimated rate which averaged percent compliance times the true rate and was highly variable percent to percent standard deviation percent only one in seven managers percent reported rate that was considered percent of the actual percent industry rate the perception of industry rates may not be the central concern of managers working to police their own noncompliance with unstable approach policy but this general lack of awareness and accuracy in estimating the true rate even among those claiming awareness cannot be overstated when asked whether they knew what their own company compliance rate was percent of managers said that they did although only percent offered an estimate of that rate thus majority of managers are largely unaware of unstable approach compliance and noncompliance rates even within their own companies of the managers who offered estimates the mean rate was percent compliance again with large range to percent and standard de percent these managers are estimating comp li rates at their companies that are on average more than percent above the industry average as they perceive it percent if their estimates were accurate they would indicate that the managers companies were outperforming the indus as whole by more than tenfold percent vs percent what is most striking is the tremendous degree of variability in the data revealing that there is very little common basis of perception even among those claiming knowledge of the rates at their own airlines in our view it is highly unlikely that this is an objective estimate for perceptions to have truly tracked with reality these data would mean that companies are ex the full range of compliance from zero to percent it is hard to imagine that this is the case and hard to imagine how this could result in an industry average that hovers at percent year after year table manager self of awareness and levels of ua policy compliance perceived rates of compliance with ua policy for the industry for their company flight operations as indicated by their company flight data analysis program awareness of rate claiming knowledge of each rate reporting rate of perceived rate of compliance not answer perceived rate of compliance those reporting go na not applicable sd standard deviation ua unstable approach source the presage group for flight safety foundation all companies percent had flight data anal program of the managers at those comp percent reported on their rate of compliance as indicated by their data these managers are not the same who reported on their companies flight operations compliance rates in answer to the prior question one in eight managers percent reported fda compliance rates broadly in line with the industry average less than percent at the opposite end of the spectrum percent re rates above percent the mean rate was percent again with wide range and variability to percent with standard deviation of percent that such spread of compliance rates is reported by this sample is surprising we believe it reflects not only general lack of awareness among managers of the rates of compliance with their own policies strongly indicated by the incidence of non but perhaps also specific errors within their knowledge although objective data are available this assertion can only be made however by again assuming that compliance rates exceeding percent are rare in the industry we cannot rule this out because although we have access to self data we lack objective verification of company compliance rates if the self rates are accurate it suggests that our sample is drawn from an unusually compliant subsample of companies in that light the lack of awareness effects across the manager study suggests that industry awareness could be less than estimated we begin with some overall observations about the data in table first on each of the three questions the norma response is to not know and only minority of man ag claim to know or report rate of compliance second as expected managers claim and report compliance rates for their own companies more frequently than they do for the industry as whole probably because they are less familiar with industry data third their perception of the industry compliance is out of line with reality six times greater than the actual percent rate of compliance fourth managers tell us as an aggregate sample that they believe their companies are outperforming the industry rate of compliance by to percent on average this is the equivalent of compliance rate at least times greater than the industry as whole finally if we assume that these com have more realistic unstable approach policy compliance rate below percent rate span still up to three times better than the current industry norm this would mean that only about one in seven managers to percent in the survey reported an accurate rate for their own companies whether their reporting was based on personal estimate or on their fda data if we give them more credit and allow that their companies actually achieved rates upward of percent then high accuracy of managers rates of report is still shared by fewer than one of the sample seven in simply do not know their own rates or if they do know they over their compliance rates by more than percent these kinds of perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence and complacency about mangers unstable approach policy compliance manager situational awareness profile manager perceptual measures of situational awareness managers completed questions to assess their attitudes beliefs and behaviors concerning their company go rates and unstable approach policies the results are in table first the responses were subjected to an empirical factor analysis to determine how they merged in managers minds and to provide simpler summary categories for presentation and discussion three of the four factors to emerge had more than one associated question one factor was single assessment of behavior namely whether the respondent debriefed flight crew who had violated the com unstable approach policy factor theme was the perceived support that the re spon received from their companies in understanding and managing go rates the six questions this factor com were averaged and called support factor comprised questions assessing the degree to which managers thought that their companies unstable approach policies and procedures and their associated operational definitions were effective clear and appropriate responses to five questions were averaged to create an index of effectiveness finally factor was an expression of man ag concerns about and sense of urgency surrounding their companies go rates it was formulated by averaging responses to the five questions shown in table and named threat in addition to the four factors we present overall measures recorded by managers of their satisfaction with and the per effectiveness of their companies go policies and procedures as they relate to unstable approaches the first thing to notice in table about these manager per is the absolute levels of the means on the underlying six scale six scale did not offer

managers perceive moderate degree of effectiveness of their policies and procedures and slightly less than moderate level of up from their organizations in managing their go rates the overall measure of perceived effectiveness was slightly weaker than the index score of effectiveness overall satisfaction with compliance rates associated with their flight operation go policies while slightly lower was still on the positive side of the scale in concert with this pattern perhaps because of these perceptions and judgments man slightly disagreed overall threat that there was cause for concern or need for action to improve their go rates taken together these absolute scores indicate that man ag are not completely happy with their companies per for on go policy and procedures but their concerns are not great enough seemingly to stimulate greater aware or action as an aside regression analysis of the drivers of the effectiveness and satisfaction scores revealed that overall effectiveness is perceived in proportion to scores on the perceived effectiveness index and to lesser degree the lack of urgency and concern is expressed by scores on the perceived threat index in complementary fashion over satisfaction was driven first by lower perceived threat scores and secondarily by higher perceptions reflected in the perceived effectiveness index these meaningful differential patterns were observed although the overall measures of satisfaction and effectiveness were high finally managers on average narrowly agreed that they all flight crews who have broken our company policies on operational procedures for go taken at its face per disagree that all flight crews are debriefed high absolute number of managers who admit to less than complete debriefing protocols however while this may seem like high percentage the fact that the statement was phrased as debrief as opposed to company debriefs may account for the response to examine the relationships between positive perceptions of organizational support compliance effectiveness satis fac and low concern with their go rates we studied responses from only those managers who had reported on their companies fda go compliance rates that is of all those claiming knowledge of this inform we divided them into managers whose reports were generally close to the industry average of percent accept anyone who reported rate of less than percent into group we labeled reporting what looked like reasonably accurate rate compared with the industry base rate all other managers reported compliance rates from to percent and were placed in comparison group labeled reporting compliance rate not likely to be accurate the results show that stating an rate of comp li is associated at significant statistical levels with higher scores on two of the five questions on the second factor of per effectiveness the effectiveness index as whole and the overall single measure of effectiveness effective it is also correlated with lower scores on the perceived threat index and four of its five component questions while this pattern may seem obvious in hindsight it makes the point that independent of the level of support perceived for man ag company go rates were no differences on the perceived support index the perception of the company policies as effective and the threat as low may flow from basic lack of realistic knowledge or appraisal of the go compliance rates if this causal effect is true that is posi perceptions lead to low perceived threat then what is clearly indicated by these data is the need for consciousness raising about the industry norm of massive noncompliance and dissemination of the managers own companies data identifying their internal rates of unstable approach around policy compliance and noncompliance segmentation analysis to determine whether the sample included types of man ag whose views of their company go compliance rate and performance were consistent with each other and also different from other identified groups we conducted traditional cluster analysis on this sample of managers non agglomerative cluster analysis based on euclidean distances due to the small sample size we generated just two groups to compare and based the mathematics of this segmentation on variety of responses given in the survey this of segmentation consisted of the perception questions and the two overall measures of effectiveness and satisfaction all the measures presented in table not surprisingly the resulting groups consisted of one whose members perceived high risk in their go compliance rates risk perceivers group and second group whose members had more moderate view risk perceivers group the percent of man ag who perceived high risk differed from the percent of low perceivers on almost all measures in the survey and powerfully so in both the statistical sense and the magnitude sense degree of statistical difference table shows that on of measures and on all three indexes the high risk perceiver group showed pattern of higher concern and perceived threat lower satisfaction with their companies go compliance lower perceived policy and compliance presage

safety foundation effectiveness and lower perceived support from the organ iz for managing go rates they also reported lower rates of debriefing their noncompliant flight crews when we profiled these two groups on other measures collected in the study we found interesting correlated ef for example high risk perceiver types tended to see their company compliance rates as slightly under perform relative to industry norms whereas low risk perceiver types reported that their companies were definitely outperforming the industry compliance rate high risk types were more likely to claim that prior to the study they had been aware of the industry rate and of their own company flight operations rate of compliance interestingly those in the high risk perceiver group were more likely to report being in roles in which they had less power to effect change more often saying they were able only to offer re com added to the fact that members of the high risk perceiver group were three times less likely than those in the low risk perceiver group to say their compliance rates were between and percent suspect number and more than four times as likely to say that their fda showed their rate was between zero and percent number more in line with industry norms picture emerges of group whose members are more realistic and appropriately anxious and concerned about their companies low rates of go compliance but who perhaps have little voice or power within the company to change policy or procedures they see as more likely to be unrealistic or to offer new definition of what should constitute stable approach they see as overly narrow how did these managers score on the presage indices of situational awareness this situation presents clear instance of violation via near noncompliance of most airlines policies and procedures surrounding unstable approach go performance rates and their manage as such our metrics are likely to show low absolute scores on scale of to with corresponding to high safety awareness the first column of table which displays these scores for the overall sample shows this to be the case in no case does the absolute score on any of our awareness metrics exceed the midscale of safety awareness is low in all of the awareness areas assessed by our system we know in this instance that unstable approach go noncompliance is major problem for the industry our measures of situational awareness are scored higher when this problem is recognized to be present in the ap to scoring shown in table all measures are scored such that higher numbers indicate greater degree of realistic threat awareness and appraisal as result higher situational awareness on our measures is associated with seeing the cur threat to be real anticipatory awareness and the procedural measures used to compensate for it to be in ad adjusting to the threat managers with higher situational awareness see their current procedures as un re and the definitions of instability as too narrow scores on knowing the procedures and knowing the limits their experience awareness high reliance on ex peri tells them there is problem and they feel more anxious and eager to take action against this safety threat gut feeling for threats however because new plan is needed in the face of general lack of appreciation of the threat to compliance in their organizations higher awareness is also associated with perception that their companies have little will to change and are generally complacent about the sops in place to manage the threat relational and corporate support for safety as result those with higher awareness also feel less support from and higher level of discomfort in approaching senior management to broach the issue with this understanding of our scoring methods in mind we examined the scores of the two groups the managers who reported compliance rate based on their fda that was than percent versus those who overest the compliance rate percent or more we hypoth sized that more accurate awareness of the true low rate of compliance would be associated with heightened sense of awareness perceived threat and anxiety the felt need to com etc all aspects of the situational awareness model we predicted therefore that managers who were aware of the actual low rate of compliance with unstable approach around policies at their airlines would receive higher scores on all nine of our metrics than their colleagues who were unaware even if the magnitude of these scores was still low in absolute terms when compared to the scale range in table it can be seen that on seven of our nine metrics of situational awareness the hypothesis that the go respondents would report greater situational awareness was supported at level of statistical reliability of percent or better that is if this experiment were repeated times we would observe the same differences in of the replications only on the procedures and each other safe were the levels of awareness similar for the two groups albeit at low absolute levels in summary those aware of the low compliance rates at their companies scored at or above the midscale on five of our metrics critical af fec anticipatory and compensatory if minimum midscale threshold of situational awareness across majority of our measures was enough to trigger some action the individuals in this group were close to reaching such trigger point how note that this group constituted just percent of of our sample small minority coming to full aware of the problem table also shows results derived from cluster analysis on the presage metrics for the two groups those perceiving relatively high risk in their companies unstable approach around policies and rates percent of sample and those not generally perceiving such risks percent will be recalled these groups were designed for all managers in the sample irrespective of whether they claimed to know or ventured to report what their company compliance rate actually was according to fda or otherwise in this case all nine awareness factors are statistically reliably different with five means above the midscale for the high perception group these results are more encouraging in terms of the complement of managers perhaps ready to act in this important area of noncompliance as about one of the sample shows signs of having reached threshold of aware that will trigger activity to manage this issue more safely in the near future as demonstration of the effect that improved awareness in one area can have on overall situational awareness we compared the situational awareness scores of all managers with the scores of the group whose members were aware of their internal company go compliance rates figure shows the incremental benefit that awareness in one area can have across eight of the nine constructs finally it is relevant to discuss the industry approach to monitoring unstable approach flight data as many flight data monitoring programs are set to report only when more than one stable approach criterion is exceeded and in some programs to report only low level alert until three or more criteria are exceeded we see an indication from those responsible for the design of these programs that there is an acknowledged variability in the risk of unstable approaches and more importantly there is an indication of disc on between the level of management concern for low risk unstable approaches and the policy guidance for flight crews on those same approaches which is to execute go when one or more criteria are exceeded from the per spec of the flight crews why should they be concerned about the risk of this level of unstable approaches if management is not concerned enough to want to be told about them or act on situational awareness of managers who knew company compliance rules feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits cop orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures additional bene base score source the presage group for flight safety foundation them this is consistent with the results of both the pilot and management psychological studies industry sensing the conversation about reducing the risk of alas often drifts toward how to eliminate unstable approaches even though the discussion begins with focus on rates of compliance with go policies it is clear that there is larger disco with the existence of unstable approaches despite the fact that the industry has reduced unstable approaches to percent or less in an industry with such variable objective environments one must ask is the lowest attainable unstable approach rate it makes sense that an industry with almost nonexistent compliance with go policies would be concerned about the small number of unstable approaches that occur if we turn the tables and consider for moment an industry with high rate of go policy compliance would there be as much concern about unstable approaches and is the focus on eliminating unstable approaches the right strategy in reducing alas in flight safety foundation year study of runway excursions conducted in we see that percent of the landing excursions were las as veer and of these percent followed stable approach that became unstable during the landing phase only percent of the landing excursions followed unstable approaches overruns accounted for the other percent of landing excursions percent of overruns followed stable approaches and percent followed unstable approaches in total percent of landing runway excursions followed stable approaches and an almost number per followed unstable approaches separate analysis by boeing of runway overrun excursions from to found that percent followed stable approaches and aaron drawing from this concentrated effort to reduce figure overall manager situational awareness scores feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits cop orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures source the presage group for flight safety foundation number of unstable approaches that become unstable in the approach phase will address less than half of all landing excursions on the other hand reliable go decision making operation has the potential to affect most landing ex those occurring after flights that become unstable during the approach or landing phase clearly strategy to continue improving the stable approach rate in addition to improving the go compliance rate is the most com strategy the point of this discussion is to illustrate that the industry tendency to focus only on eliminating unstable approaches will not address large portion of alas and that improving the go compliance rate holds the greater risk potential in an fsf runway safety initiative determined that gap existed in alar tool kit risk reduction tools which did not address the landing phase itself the foundation then developed safe landing guidelines keys to safe arrival which are intended to be used by aircraft operators to enhance existing sops throughout this project and through industry confer and meetings it was apparent that these guidelines were not well known or commonly documented in company manuals these findings were not part of the data collection surveys findings go decision making the following are decision findings drawn from analysis mp denotes decision pilot findings and mm denotes decision management findings mp finding the unstable approach pilot group gut feeling for threats the of the pants experience characterized by an emotional sensory experience that triggers further cog ni analysis is lower than it is for the go pilot group mp finding the unstable approach pilot group ability to see and monitor real and potential threats as they change over time and space is lower than that of the go pilot group mp finding the unstable approach pilot group is more likely than the go pilot group to minimize efforts to discuss instability and environmental factors with other crew members and to shut themselves off from available resources mp finding unstable approach pilots are more tolerant than go pilots of deviations from operational limits and procedures mp finding unstable approach pilots are less compliant than go pilots with performing all checklist items and ccu rately completing standard calls mp finding unstable approach pilots minimize what their pro experience or critical awareness could offer in terms of executing known policies compared with go pilots mp finding unstable approach pilots are more comfortable than go pilots with operating on the margins of safety which translates into greater tolerance of risk mp finding unstable approach pilots are more likely than go pilots to feel pressure to land or perceive lack of support for decision to go around mp finding unstable approach pilots are more likely than go pilots to feel discomfort in being challenged or chal others finding unstable approach pilots are likely to feel in about calling for go in situations with strong cockpit authority gradient mp finding go pilots indicated four times more often than unstable approach pilots that another crew mem ber was prompting the crew to initiate go mp finding unstable approach pilots are less likely than go pilots to feel support for safety from their companies and said they were less likely to be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to landing and more likely to believe that the incentive structure of their company does not discourage unstable approaches to landing mp finding unstable approach pilots believe that their com criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic mp finding unstable approach pilots in hindsight feel regret about continuing an unstable approach more strongly than go pilots regret going around and feel less positive about the outcomes of their decisions mp finding unstable approach pilots have lower sense of situational awareness across most facets which leads them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their risk assessments finding pilot norms and processes for continuing unstable approaches provide little foundation for compliant go decision making the action is to not go around when unstable mp finding norms roles and incentives have displaced some influence that good situational awareness should have in risk assessment and decision making finding pilots who believe that their company criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe on whole that the threshold for the aircraft to be on profile and in proper configuration is below ft closer to to ft agl mp finding pilots who believe that their company criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe on whole that they can compensate for energy management until the aircraft descends to ft agl and under certain conditions below ft mm finding at the managerial level there are indications of general disengagement with the topic of go policy and procedures mm finding among managers there is general lack of awareness of industry rates of go policy compliance finding among managers there is general lack of awareness of their own company rates of go policy compliance finding among managers who have objective go noncompliance rate data such as flight data understanding of the compliance rate is likely inaccurate mm finding managers who claim to know the company go around compliance rate are likely to overstate the compliance rate by over percent these perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence about go compliance mm finding managers perceive moderate degree of ef fec of their policies and procedures mm finding managers perceive less than moderate level of support within their company for managing go comp li rates mm finding managers slightly disagree overall that there is concern about or need for action to improve their go compliance rates mm finding the managers with better understanding of go compliance rates for both the industry and their own companies the high risk perceiver group were more realistic and concerned about their companies low go compliance but perhaps have little voice or authority within the company to change policy or procedures mm finding managers who scored higher on the situational awareness measure associated with seeing the current threat as real awareness also scored lower in relative terms on the measure used to compensate correctly for the risk awareness suggesting the presence of helplessness with respect to effectively managing this risk mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores see their current procedures as being unrealistic and definitions of instabilities as being too narrow mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores had the perception that their companies have little will to change and are generally complacent about sops for managing go compliance mm finding managers with higher awareness of their companies go compliance rates also feel less support from senior managers and higher level of discomfort with ap them about the issue mm finding managers who were aware of low go compliance rates in their companies scored at or above the midscale on functional critical affective anticipatory and compensatory situational awareness metrics this is minority consisting of percent of respondents mm finding the industry tendency is to lean toward the single focus of improving the unstable approach rate as the best way to prevent alas even though empirical data indicate otherwise finding safe landing guidelines published by flight safety foundation to address an identified gap in the alar tool kit risk reduction tools is not well known by operators and not documented in operations manuals strategies for corrective action go decision making we conclude that there are three high categories that can be defined in achieving an effective policy from psycho logi perspective the policy should make sense operationally for most environmental conditions encountered for the people executing the policy crews and those managing the policy operations management and should be acceptable to those externally effected by the application of the policy traffic controllers the policy must be managed effectively by the organ iz tion management personnel this is important not only because of the organization need to achieve objectives set out by senior management but also because those exec ut the policy crews need to see and understand that the policy is being managed management over of the policy is apparent awareness of the policy guidance and the risks associated with not executing the policy must be high for both flight crews and management the following is list of recommended higher decision making strategies to mitigate go noncompliance dm strategy ensure the policy makes sense operationally update the stable approach definition and sah to maximize their relevance to flight crews and their manageability separate the stable approach definition and criteria from decision criteria and decision points to improve awareness that these are two distinct aspects of go policies and that decision making continues beyond the approach phase this does not imply that they cannot meet at points throughout the approach and landing it is intended for the sop and communication designers to separate the psychological attachment of these two aspects dm strategy manage the policy effectively operators set specific compliance rate targets per for indicators and establish initiatives to achieve them authorities amend industry and regulatory audit pro to include standards and recommended practices that address go noncompliance dm strategy increase awareness increase awareness of go noncompliance and risks associated with continuing to land when unstable and awareness of the significant impact that noncom pli has on alas among operator management ii flight crews iii industry and pilot associations regulators and manufacturers enhance situational awareness awareness to heighten flight crews awareness throughout the ap and beyond and landing through policy and procedural enhancements and ii communication improvements minimize the subjectivity of go decision making for the decision maker pf or captain as per com policy to mitigate those components of situational awareness that compromise the pilot risk assessment and decision ability for example by installing stable approach monitoring systems recommendations go decision making the following are decision recommendations for corrective action to mitigate go noncompliance and go execution risks each recommendation supports previously identified higher strategy dm recommendation manufacturers should continue develop of and operators should install stable approach and energy management monitoring and alerting systems dm recommendation operators should understand their own respective go compliance rates dm recommendation operators should establish internal go around compliance rate measures targets and goals dm recommendation where necessary flight crew assoc ia and operator management should establish basis and or process in which fda can be used to assist in effectively managing go compliance targets dm recommendation operators and the industry should re the stable approach criteria and sah to better align policies with manageable and operational safe practices see appendix for flight safety foundation analysis new stabilized approach and go guidelines for industry validation avoid stable approach criteria and heights that address very low approaches that is avoid criteria that if exceeded are not likely to result in go decision or that if go decision is made may transfer risk to higher go maneuver distinguish between profile criteria and lateral energy management criteria and go decision point criteria which could have distinct and separate heights allow for variable objective environments not all environ ment create the same risk profile high crosswind tail winds and contaminated runways statistically create the highest environments the stable approach criteria although mostly prescriptive should allow an element of guided risk decision making that is corroborated between crew members dm recommendation operators should establish and publish safe landing guidelines in operations manuals keys to safe arrival and bla je see appendix analysis revised safe landing guidelines for industry validation dm recommendation operators should develop com munic procedures to be performed during every approach that describes the state of stability and the intention of the decision maker based on company policy effective elements of these communications include the state of stability is made by the crew member not responsible for the decision to go around the pm or the first officer per company policy this creates shared responsibility for activity in the decision process communication procedures are active not passive or conditional call is made at the assigned point during every approach this forces communication communication procedures should be objective they should state facts about the condition this minimizes authority gradients within the cockpit communication procedures should be sequential and esca late if the condition is not corrected to within limits ac calls continue and escalate to defined point at which new directive call is mandated for example if an call at ft agl does not result in successful corrective action the calls continue every ft until the condition is corrected or critical point is reached and then directive call is made this maintains continuous situational awareness updating of the condition similar to ground warning system calls active communication should continue well into the ap proach and landing up to the touchdown limit point this maintains continuous situational awareness each condition call should be answered with an ac or notice call by the decision maker pf or captain per company policy the call should not suggest the exclusion of other possible outcomes calling at mini when go is an option can have the effect of minimizing the window of calling for go on the other hand responding with or assists in keeping decision making open dm recommendation operators should apply objective feedback procedures well into the approach and landing phase including in the touchdown zone energy management monitoring and alerting systems will minimize the need for crew calls dm recommendation operators should create standard pre descent briefing guidelines that include environmental risk factors instability factors that will result in go review of standard calls and decision making in the landing phase recommendation operators should create standard pre approach briefing guidelines that update the pre brief at low period just before the approach is begun dm recommendation operators should understand their re spec managers and flight crews situational awareness levels and psychological profiles for managing internal go policies dm recommendation operators should provide training to enhance psychosocial awareness and management and how they contribute to noncompliant decision making dm recommendation operators should ensure no fault go around policies are documented implemented and understood by management and flight crew dm recommendation operators should ensure that un approach and go policies are concise and un am big uous including follow procedures and expectations for noncompliance recommendation operators should communicate indus rates and internal go compliance rates measures targets and goals of performance to flight crews and the man ag involved in achieving them operators also should co mmu the risk potential that improved performance could have on the company overall risk profile dm recommendation state and industry audit programs such as the iata operational safety audit should establish go compliance standards and recommended practices for operators to manage go compliance dm recommendation state and industry safety organizations such as those associated with the international civil aviation organization the european aviation safety agency faa iata the faa commercial aviation safety team etc should review these recommendations and assess inserting them into their safety publications dm recommendation the aviation community should annually track through global aggregate flight data go compliance rates for both the approach phase and the landing phase of flight and communicate the findings to the industry this role is suited to safety organizations such as flight safety foundation dm recommendation the aviation community should develop and implement an initiative that communicates the industry go compliance rate and the risk potential that improved performance could have on the industry ala rate and the overall accident rate this is role suited to regulators global associations and safety organ such as flight safety foundation dm recommendation the aviation community should estab new information program to provide method for operators to share effective strategies to improve go around compliance rates alternatively the information should be incorporated into an existing program dm recommendation the industry should establish an ident fi for the threat effect of the phenomenon of noncompliance with go polices as labels such as con flight into terrain or loss of control make it easier for the industry to relate discuss understand and manage phenomenon label for this phenomenon will do the same and in so doing will help provide foundation for essential awareness effective utility of each recommendation is different and each recommendation addresses different finding or strategy as can be seen in appendix holistic approach to implementing these recommendations will have the best overall effect and as with any significant program change desired and undesired effects should be closely monitored by an appropriate audit program such as fda line operations safety audits or ios go execution methodology the go accident and incident review included non random selection of published reports on go in vol transport aircraft between and total of go events were included in some the safety of the go was central to the investigation and in others the go occurred in the aftermath of the event at the heart of the investigation the majority of the events percent involved single jets others involved twin turboprops percent and twin jets percent the nature of the sample independently investigated events in which an approach was followed at some point by go around meant that the sample group contained both safe and unsafe go sometimes the investigations focused on the circumstances that led to the go sometimes they focused on the go itself and sometimes they focused on both remarks contrasting the safe go with the risk bearing go are therefore subject to the qualification that the safe ones were just non subset of many more similar go that are routinely conducted because of both crew decisions and atc instructions the context safety aspects and overall level of risk of each event were shown on spreadsheet with as many of elec of as were applicable attached to each one not all tags were mutually exclusive and not all reports allowed the applicability of all of the tags to be established the extent to which many characteristics could be identified is therefore understated on the basis of the degree of risk posed by go each event was assigned to one of three categories high risk events moderate risk events and non events the non events involved circumstances some of which were similar to those of risk events that were the main concern of the investigation for the two risk categories six go around safety issues were defined in respect to the initiation and execution of each go most of the risk bearing events involved single gas but five events were assigned two gas is each each risk event was assigned one of three risks loc fit or midair collision the gas definitions and their associated outcome risks were ao initiation of go ineffective ao safe trajectory of aircraft not maintained once go around successfully initiated ao go not flown on required track at safe traffic separation not maintained during go around at wake turbulence hazard during go and en significant low wind shear during go in the percent of risk go in which the risk was attributable to the mismanagement and mishandling of the go by pilots failure to initiate go effectively was twice as prevalent as the failure to aviate and navigate properly once the go was initially established in the percent of risk go in which the risk was attributable to air traffic controllers the follow conditions applied one go followed controller failure to apply clearly established procedures in respect to late go which led directly to an unrecognized mac risk resolved by traffic and collision avoidance system resolution advisory five go involved controller misjudgments in dealing with the proximity of takeoffs to unexpected go around significant loss of separation in four cases and an unrecognized wake turbulence hazard in the other two events involved controllers talking to different aircraft on the same frequency in different languages in both cases pilots seeking to understand the developing situ both before and after the go began were deprived of valuable situational awareness two go involved single conflict between pilot declared go and controller go in which trainee controller under supervision in non radar environment was faced with an aircraft transition to conventional go and the resulting need to instruct the potentially conflicting aircraft which was on required navigation performance approach to fly an rn go the situational awareness of each flight crew both on go in imc of the potential proximity of the other aircraft was compromised by lack of procedure awareness decisions by pilots that were followed by poor initiation of go and that led to hull loss accidents in an airplane is destroyed or damaged and not repaired including events in which an airplane is missing or in acce due to either loc or fit were particularly likely to in crew in which either the pilot or the first officer was lacking in experience for the pic this lack of experience involved experience in either the aircraft type or the role of pic for the first officer it involved experience in the aircraft type or in multi operations generally all events in which the experience of both pilots was fully documented one or both pilots were low on experience ac to the above definitions in percent of fatal loss go accidents percent of all high go percent of all moderate go and percent of all non go excessive confidence by the pm pic that the pf first officer would achieve timely stabilization of the approach led the pic to delay takeover as pf often by the time the pic took the controls the circumstances had become more complex and the chances of not properly initiating the go had increased conversely excessive confidence by the pm first officer that the pf pic would achieve timely stabilization led in operating cultures that may not have addressed the effect of significant relative experience gap between the first officer and the pic to delayed or absent go call and in some cases to near takeover or an on takeover of control in order to make such call the more go are more likely than safer go around to have been preceded by one or more of the following significant procedural noncompliance which was recorded in percent of high events but in only percent of moderate events the same percentage as reported in non events delay in making the decision to go around which was re corded in percent of high events but only percent of medium events an even lower proportion than for non events and complex situation at the time of the go decision which was recorded in percent of high events but only percent of medium events about the same as for non events significant violation of landing minimums followed by go around decision was particular precursor of the nine fatal defined in this analysis as one or both of hours on type or hours in command defined in this analysis as one or both of hours multi experience or hours on type accidents during subsequently attempted go four percent of risk go decisions were made above ft half of these decisions were made because of an unstable approach condition compared with moderate go high go around are more likely to involve pilots with low levels of experience involve go decision made below decision altitude descent altitude be flown by the pic as pf be at risk of loc follow violation of da and involve surprise that they have become necessary high go are less likely to follow an unstabilized approach and involve change of pf at initiation of or during the go compared with moderate go non go are more likely to follow go decisions that were foreseen as poss bili rather than those that occurred unexpectedly and be made on atc instructions they are less likely to take place at night involve pilots with low levels of experience have the first officer as pf and involve surprise that they have become necessary they are just as likely to be preceded by significant procedural noncompliance and involve change of pf at the initiation of or during the go analysis go execution the go flight operations data analysis was performed with the objective of examining the prevalence of go safety risk during normal routine operations more than go events flown by jet aircraft operated by range of airlines from around the world were examined the analysis focused on the point at which the go began and the way it was conducted go events were found in data detailing almost flights the majority of these flights percent involved single jets twin jets made up the remain percent data showed that percent of the flight crews disc on the autopilot above ft percent disconnected the auto throttle above flare altitudes and percent disc on the flight director during the approach data showed the overall rate of go was percent or in approaches however it was possible to distinguish two subgroups lower go rate of percent for operators that appeared more likely to sub se divert following go and higher rate of percent for operators that appeared less likely to do so the go rate for long operations was percent higher than the overall rate for single jets the autopilot was engaged prior to go initiation in percent of the events and remained engaged in percent of these cases for twin jets the autopilot was engaged prior to the go initiation in percent of the events and remained engaged in percent of these cases forty percent of all go were initiated below ft percent were initiated below the category instrument landing system ils minimum height of ft and percent were initiated below ft exceed ance of the maximum permitted airspeed with flaps extended fe was recorded in percent of single jet go and percent of the twin jet go these fe exceed ance correlated with failure to reach and maintain the appropriate pitch target extended duration of go power settings an elapsed time of more than seconds without re trac of one stage of flaps applied in percent of cases and unstable approach an overall association was identified between the height on the approach at which go was initiated and the pitch attitude at which it was then flown the earlier the initiation of the go the lower the pitch attitude the data showed widespread prevalence of delayed flap retraction once go had been initiated whereas in only percent of go did it take more than seconds to retract the landing gear findings go execution go safety forum initiated by flight safety foundation the european regions airline association and euro control took place june at euro control headquarters in brussels it was held in support of the flight safety foundation go safety initiative to assist in early implementation of the actions detailed in the european action plan for the prevention of runway excursions issued in january the conference was attended by over par including members of the french bureau et who were conducting study of airplane state awareness during go the execution findings findings from the go safety forum included the following safety found era euro control ex finding go occur at an average rate of one to three per approaches there is large variation of go around rates among different aircraft operators and operational environments ex finding the go is normal phase of flight and pilots should be encouraged to conduct one when conditions warrant as well as when they are instructed to do so however since go is the least flown normal flight phase there are particular safety issues associated with it ex finding one in go reports record potentially hazardous outcome including exceeded aircraft performance limits or fuel endurance ex finding go is relatively rare maneuver for most commercial pilots on average short pilot may conduct go once or twice year and long pilot may conduct one every two to three years ex finding conducting go carries number of risks including ineffective initiation of go which can lead to loc failure to maintain control during go which can lead to loc including abnormal contact with the runway or to fit failure to fly the required track which can lead to fit or mac failure to maintain traffic separation which can lead to mac and generation of wake turbulence which may create hazard for another aircraft that can lead to loc ex finding the height at which go is initiated during an approach can present different challenges and risks above the approach procedure minimum altitude at the approach procedure minimum altitude and below the approach minimum altitude finding low relevant experience of one or both pilots is associated with difficulty in flying go ex finding go that follow violation of approach minimums are associated with reduced safety margin ex finding it is necessary for operators to be aware of the extent to which go are being flown and the validated reasons for them as well as the extent to which the go are flown safely ex finding just culture must prevail if problems in go around safety are to be sufficiently understood and addressed ex finding aircraft energy states that are too high or too low make the safe execution of go less likely and this situation can be exacerbated by failure to understand how to manage aircraft pitch attitude ex finding the safety of go is compromised by de in deciding to begin go when the aircraft becomes unstabilized below mandatory stabilized approach gate approach gates ex finding the decisions that precede unsafe go are often made at points other than pre procedural decision points finding pilot go training needs to be pro por to the rate at which go are experienced in line operations ex finding the effectiveness of flight deck monitoring can have significant effect on the safe execution of go but such monitoring often is poor ex finding lack of an adequate understanding of automation by pilots can affect go safety ex finding pilot understanding of how the pitch control system works is not always apparent in their actions during go ex finding the potential for traffic and wake vortex conflict during go is sometimes reduced if pilots are unaware of other traffic in the vicinity ex finding most pilots fly the potentially complex transition to go from circle approach so infrequently that maintaining competency will require an unrealistic amount of recurrent training in proportion to other requirements ex finding the extent of controller training in respect to go around risk management is variable ex finding controllers sometimes issue instructions that may prevent pilots from conducting stabilized approach and may thereby increase the number of go ex finding go procedures can be complex at time of high workload for pilots the procedures are not always published tactical de of go can place high demands on controllers complexity is increased when there are multiple approach procedures for the same runway each with its own missed approach point ex finding too much information in one controller radio transmission an explanation of the reason when giving an executive instruction can lead to pilot confusion late provision of or changes to go instructions late changes to published map unless these clearly simplify it increase workload for pilots ex finding some pilots are reluctant to decline acceptance of atc instructions that are not compatible with aircraft per especially when issued at times when pilot work is already high issuing unpublished go approach tactical instructions at or after the initiation of go can place high demands on pilots there is no direct link between aircraft operator and atc go training awareness ex finding current pilot go procedures may not adequately address all the circumstances in which an ad hoc go around decision may be made especially above ft agl or after decision to continue an approach made at da ex finding go operational challenges are not ad reflected in current regulatory requirements strategies for corrective action go execution the safety forum discussed in depth the issues related to go around decision making execution and training and the air traffic management aspects of safe go forum par agreed on series of conclusions in respect to eight safety improvement strategies three of these strategies were execution strategies strategies related to the safe execution of go ex strategy ensure that go training and awareness ap reflect different go execution risk scenarios note independent cast analysis determined similar find and recommendations which are outlined in cast safety enhancement ex strategy review go policy procedures and ocu men to maximize their effectiveness clarity and understanding ex strategy ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew members does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitor during approach landing and go recommendations go execution the following principal recommendations for safe go execution recommendations are based on safety forum conclusions ex recommendation aircraft operators and atc should im their mutual understanding of each other go practices ex recommendation industry partners should develop go around training aids ex recommendation effective monitoring depends on ensuring that pilots with low relevant experience are able to contribute to safe go decision making and execution ex recommendation pilots and their employers should under that one of the many reasons that violating approach minimums is unacceptable is because evidence indicates that if go then becomes necessary the chances of safe transition to the go are reduced ex recommendation pilots must be able to demonstrate that they are able to safely execute go that begin from both high energy and low energy states at the point where go around decision is indicated ex recommendation pilots must be able to exercise tactical judgment as well as procedural compliance when deciding to go around below stabilized approach gate so that safe execution is not hindered by an inappropriate delay in decision making validation of this must be achieved through realistic training scenarios ex recommendation go training for pilots should include range of operational scenarios including go from positions other than da and the designated sta approach gate scenarios should involve realistic simulation of surprise typical landing weights and full go ex recommendation go training for both pilots and controllers should incorporate lessons learned from operational events ex recommendation clear guidance should be provided to pilots on how to act in respect to the three stages of monitoring during approach landing and go noticing alerting and taking control members of augmented crews who are observing should have clear understanding of the nature of their contr to effective monitoring ex recommendation if an aircraft has the capability to fly automatic go pilot training should be provided and the operator automation policy should address the go procedure ex recommendation pilots must have clear understanding of how the pitch control system works on the aircraft type that they fly this should be validated by both theoretical testing and use of suitable full flight simulator exercises involving approach and go with full rather than reduced power available and at typical landing weights ex recommendation review should be conducted to deter whether pilots can lose situational awareness of pot en conflicting traffic during go if other pilots are exchanging radio transmissions with atc in languages other than english ex recommendation high priority should be accorded to the provision of rn approach and missed approach pro ce dures when current procedures involve circle and when active radar surveillance of the transition to go is not available consideration should be given to withdrawing circle procedures at airports where neither option is available ex recommendation air navigation service providers should review and if necessary enhance the provision of go around risk awareness training for controllers ex recommendation ensure that the importance of fac lit at stabilized approach and the correct application of final approach procedures is included in training and in briefings for atc staff recommendation implementation advice training should include appropriate speed control instructions timely descent instructions the importance of avoiding late change of runway or change in the type of approach the importance of assigning landing runway with no significant tail wind component the need to avoid vectoring too tightly onto final ap and intercepting glide path from above and the importance of providing the crew with correct information about distance to touchdown ex recommendation the agency responsible for instrument approach procedure design should ensure that straightforward go procedures are available and published for each runway these go procedures should be designed in consultation with pilots who are representative of those who will be expected to use them advice the principles which underlie the map for each run should as much as possible be the same low below ft first stop altitude and an early turn in missed approach procedure should be avoided conditional go procedures approach procedures xxx but not later than yy should be avoided the common missed approach fix should be located close to the airport to ensure that an aircraft in trouble can be landed immediately on any runway with any track chosen by the pilot procedural de of the missed approach path from other traffic and from the risk of exposure to wake turbulence especially from late go should be provided if both rn and conventional missed approach pro ce are published then an explicit risk assessment of such availability should be performed environmental restrictions especially noise abatement restrictions must not affect the design of missed approach procedures if their imposition would compromise safety standards ex recommendation on final approach pilots should be advised of any significant changes in weather and runway surface conditions contingency arrangements should exist for use in wind shear conditions implementation advice pilots should receive more relevant and quicker up of weather information about develop such as changes in visibility wind and runway status quantity of water on the runway improved information should be provided to crews about tail winds wind shear and significant wind variation including reports from preceding aircraft runway information should include items such as braking action reports information about the pre of standing water debris and wildlife including birds reports of technical problems on the ground and reports of laser interference ex recommendation guidance should be developed for controllers regarding the content and timing of go instructions advice controllers should consider whether go instruction should be delivered in separate trans mis from one that explains the instruction controllers must always use the standard map if there is no imperative reason for an adaptation if non missed approach procedure is to be followed controllers should detail it when issuing the approach clearance controllers should avoid last changes or in except in emergency situations once pilot has declared go or is otherwise known to have begun one controllers should avoid unnecessary transmissions pilot should inform atc as soon as possible if devi from the published go procedure become necessary ex recommendation an sps should consider the feasibility of establishing formal interface between pilots and controllers to explore operational issues and reach an understanding implementation advice pilots can be invited to attend controllers training sessions and controllers may be able to arrange to observe pilots training sessions days can be provided for pilots to observe operations at atc facilities and it may be possible to organize familiarization flights for controllers pilots and controllers should participate in joint crew resource management training in establishing such interfaces be aware that it is most unlikely that the pilots participating in such an initiative will be representative of those using the atc services involved and any such bias must be explicitly recognized ex recommendation aircraft manufacturers should ensure that go procedures presented in aircraft pilot training and aircraft operating manuals are applicable to go that are begun at any stage on final approach up to and including land that are rejected after touchdown ex recommendation safety regulators should review current mandatory go training requirements for both pilots and controllers and should ensure that the conclusions of this report are appropriately addressed flight safety foundation future work establish go noncompliance industry label such as gan noncompliance or fga to go around this is to establish easy recognition as has been accomplished with other labels such as loc or fit analyze and report at global aggregate level unstable approaches and unstable landings to determine the level of associated risk report global go compliance performance annually develop go execution and training guidelines for operators establish industry go noncompliance audit standards and recommended practices with organizations such as the international civil aviation organization and iata in order to minimize the exposure to unnecessary go while ensuring safety further analysis is required to deter the risk balance point between an unstable approach and go the foundation should ensure industry partners pursue this analysis promote the distribution and presentation of this report in industry and encourage republication in complementing publications and safety initiatives project conclusion the problem of go policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the largest threat to flight safety today the potential impact of improvement in compliance is igni fi no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go around the first and foremost change required is that the industry must improve its awareness of the problem to achieve this shift in focus and cultural norms is required it is believed that significant improvement is attainable however the cultural shift will be much easier if the industry shifts collectively as opposed to individual companies making changes on their own having said this several companies are already attacking this issue internally the project accomplished the goals set forth in the document announcing the fsf go safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight crew members and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight managers and to consider the safety risk associated with go and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines

fully stabilized when all of the following criteria are met pro only small changes in heading are required to maintain the correct flight path profile specific types of approaches are stabilized if

be observed and active communication calls made during each approach normal bracketing corrections in maintaining stabilized conditions occasionally involve momentary overshoots made necessary by atmospheric conditions such overshoots are acceptable frequent or sustained overshoots are not unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions requiring deviation from the above elements require

notes continuing past the related gate should only occur if meeting the objective of the next gate is achievable otherwise go around example if the is not con by ft it could continue if being fully stable by ft is achievable if the call at the respective gate indicates an undesired state con or that call should be repeated at an appropriate interval until the condition is corrected example repeated every ft stabilized approach and go decision guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind flight safety found guidelines for conducting stabilized approaches and achieving reliable go decision making why the change the current fsf guidelines were established in november and updated in analysis revealed that facets of that guidance are not optimal for effective deci making and that they may encourage go for approaches involving very low risk the overall goal is to improve go decision making in revising the stabilized approach guidelines four objectives must be met the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and management resulting in greater acceptance of the policy safety must be ensured during the approach by mitigating against the common types of alas energy short hard landing tail strike and runway excursions veer it must be ensured that the resulting go are con ducted for approaches of appropriate risk and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to go ma increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on atc the flight crew collective situational awareness must be improved through better communication flight crews indicated in the foundation project research that current guidelines on when go must be executed are not realistic for most real operational environments and approaches they described what realistic parameters look like from their perspective the criteria for which stable approach is defined can be grouped into three types of parameters flight path profile and lateral configuration gear and speed brakes and energy management of descent speed and thrust add to these the variable environmental conditions length and condition and weather and there are four groups of parameters to be considered when designing stable approach criteria approach gates we can address all stable approach parameters and ala safety issues at three procedural gates agl configuration gate from ft to ft depending on aircraft type agl stable gate and agl go gate the stable approach criteria are the same at each gate for ap conducted in both imc and vmc ft agl configuration gate previous guidance required that go must be con if the flight was not fully stable in imc with respect to the physics of go safety is the same in both imc and vmc in this context differentiation of go at feet in imc and at feet in vmc is not required the new functional significance of the mark is that it is the last suitable point along the approach to ensure that final landing configuration is selected and verified by the flight crew the flap and gear transition deceleration to final approach speed and thrust stabilization should occur before the aircraft reaches the next gate at ft agl it should be emphasized that initial configuration should occur before reaching the gate this gate is the last point at which final landing configuration should be selected and confirmed the gate is familiar demarcation to flight crews and is often accompanied by an automatically generated callout note that the gate may vary for air type and gross weight the operator should determine the appropriate height of the gate based on aircraft de cele ra characteristics and the manufacturer recommend the following discussion of aircraft energy management during approach is based on the fsf alar briefing notes safety foundation aircraft deceleration characteristics although deceleration characteristics largely depend on the aircraft type and gross weight the following typical values can be considered for quick assessment and management of aircraft deceleration capability deceleration on three glide path with landing flaps and gear down to kt per nm note three glide path is typically equivalent to descent gradient of or vertical speed for final approach groundspeed of kt example aircraft with final approach speed of kt would need to be at maximum speed of kt at the gate to be stable at ft using the median deceleration rate of kt per nm and descent rate of fpm kt nm kt gate does not address any particular ala type but serves to facilitate achieving fully stabilized approach at the next lower gate ft additionally it is in line with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project that aircraft configuration and aircraft energy management are two separate and distinct aspects of stabilized approach and the aircraft energy stabilization height can be lower than the aircraft configuration height although go may be considered at this gate not mandating go at this point reduces the overall number of potential go by allowing low unstable approaches to continue at safe altitude analysis is discussed in improved collective situational awareness at this gate is achieved through procedural active communication between flight crew agl gate previous guidance required that go must be conduct if the flight was not fully stable in vmc the revised guid retains the recommendation that the approach should be fully stable at this gate however the mandate to go around has been removed although go may be considered at this gate not mandating go reduces the overall number of potential go by allowing low unstable approaches to con while at safe altitude analysis is found in not mandating go at this gate also aligns with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project findings indicating go can still be executed safely even from lower altitudes when conditions are stable or have only minor deviations outside the stable approach definition as this makes operational sense to those who execute and manage the policy there is better likelihood of compliance the gate is suitable point in the approach for flight crew to verify all stable approach criteria it is familiar de mar for flight crews and is also often accompanied by an au generated callout being stable at this point in the approach allows for subsequent developing instabilities to be compared against state of constant energy reduction improved collective situational awareness at this gate is also achieved through procedural active communication between flight crew ft agl go gate this gate is new establishing this gate clearly marks the boundary between higher altitudes where stable approach is strongly recommended and the point where continuing an unstable descent reduces the margin of safety it differentiates between approach stability and go decision these are two distinct flight issues and from sy perspective they should remain distinct elements in decision making it should be understood that the agl value is not intended to be absolute it can be approximated to take ad of aircraft automatic callout systems for example consider an ils minimum set for ft agl some manuf ac automatic callout systems provide an alert ft above minimums so in such cases ft agl could be established as the go gate value and utilized in the auto callout in the active call procedures descending in an unstable state below the gate should be warning to flight crews that the level of risk is increasing and action is required whether the aircraft is unstable at this gate or becomes unstable below ft analyses indicate that flight crews who continue an unstable descent below ft do not recognize the need for increased concern or the need for go the awareness of the increased need for action can be improved by heightening the definition of the aircraft condition from being in an unstable condition to being in condition to go around this can prompt the flight crew to make the correct decision to go around martin smith of the pre group explains psychological tipping point is the moment of maximum situational awareness is when the flight crew is primed to pull the trigger on the go the subtle change to to go around is such primer in other words the to go around is permission to act per mis to comply drawing comparison to another industry initiative the pilot not flying is now known as the pm change that was intended to influence the mindset of the pm and also to alter his behavior in recognition of the importance of monitoring similar effect can be realized in identifying an unstable flight condition below ft as go condition condition that demands go decision to further emphasize the point the to win can be viewed as the stable approach zone with the focus on ensuring that the aircraft is fully stabilized the area from ft to thrust can be viewed as the primary go zone where the focus shifts from tabi liz the aircraft to going around using rejected takeoff below maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action to stop the airplane within the accelerate stop distance as an analogy rejected takeoff below kt is considered to occur in different regime speed compared with rejected takeoff above kt high regime here through training and guidance there is shift in psychology for pilots operating in the low vs high regime similar shift can be realized through the approach to landing lowering the go execution altitude reduces the overall number of potential go by allowing low approaches to continue while at higher safer alti it makes the stable approach and go policies more in line with flight crews psychological beliefs and more manageable by management prevents risk transfer from low risk unstable approaches to potentially higher go and limits unnecessary demands on the air traffic system if not fully stable at or below this gate the decision to go around should be made without hesitation go below ft is not necessarily unsafe this determination depends on the degree and type of approach instability and aircraft type and performance characteristics this gate is essentially the beginning of the primary go zone from ft to thrust reverser deployment at this gate the low ala is addressed the most common types of low energy alas are landing short hard landing and tail strike if we analyze the most extreme case of low energy it is one where thrust is at flight idle speed is ref and the descent rate is fpm double normal rate of descent federal aviation regulations part says the landing configuration the steady gradient climb may not be less than percent with the engines at the power or thrust that is available eight seconds after initialization of move of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight idle to go power setting and design and construction of the engine must enable an increase from the fixed minimum flight idle power from not more than percent of rated takeoff power or thrust available to percent in not less than five seconds the most limiting of these two regulations is the eight requirement in our extreme low case of descending at fpm using linear anal without taking into consideration lessening of the rate of descent as engines spool and achieving climb gradient the flight will descend ft figure per min ft another useful analysis comes from flight safety foundation alar tool kit which says that an aircraft being flown on go while on approach path with thrust at flight idle descending at fpm and with ref at minus kt will experience an altitude loss of approximately ft safety foundation if we more than double the rate of descent to fpm in this analysis the aircraft would ex an altitude loss of approximately feet alar tool kit figure it is also interesting to look at design specifications for taws such as egp ws the technical standard order for such systems requires that for the final approach segment descent warning be given in time to allow for obstacle clear altitude after recovery that includes one pilot response time and standard gravitational accel era pull of transportation faa the tso further describes the altitude loss of an aircraft de at fpm with response time of one second and pull as being ft and says the required warning should be given no later than ft above the obstacle tso figure in comparison with these analyses gate of ft agl to execute go provides adequate altitude margin for even the most extreme low unstable approach the margin in this case results in percent increase over the linear eight part determination percent increase over the fsf alar determination and percent increase over the taws determination although the number of approach and landing accidents is greater than the number of go accidents the go around phase of flight has more fatalities per accident by ensuring safe altitude of ft to conduct go in the extreme unstable low case and by allowing low unstable approaches to continue between ft and ft the potential number of go would be reduced lower the exposure to go risks comparisons of revised gates to industry monitoring and alerting systems and faa runway overrun prevention references the project identified significant decision benefits in reducing the subjectivity of the decision analysis by flight crew the most impactful way to minimize subjectivity is to employ automated systems similar in concept to egp ws figure go altitude loss analysis unstable condition speed ref thrust idle vertical rate fpm loss from ft above ground level fars part alar

source flight safety foundation tcas to help flight crews make timely and consistent decisions the industry has developed few systems in the form of stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems for approach and landing energy management the airbus runway overrun protection system has number of alerting and monitoring functions but those that are pertinent to this analysis are the visual alert that begins at ft agl and the aural alert at ft agl rop does present evaluation of aircraft real energy and the runway distance available for landing and provides visual too short alert at ft and an aural alert at ft jacob because of the lower altitudes at which these alerts occur and considering the severity of the condition that is not enough runway to stop the aircraft go really is the only option except in the most dire emergencies when comparing this condition to the conditions being applied to the proposed stabilized approach and go guidelines the fsf guide are quite conservative honeywell smart landing system also has many alerting and monitoring functions including aural alerts beginning at ft agl and ending at ft agl with an unstable alert the criteria used by the system to make the alert are variable but based on monitoring excessive approach angle excessive speed and flap settings honeywell intern again the altitudes where these alerts are given are similar to those recommended in the stabilized ap and go guidelines achieving collective situational awareness through active communication this project found that situational awareness is lacking among most flight crews who continue an unstable descent and land unstable communication is vital in achieving high situational awareness two key types of communication are recommended for improvements approach and landing brief and active communication sops throughout the approach pre approach and landing briefings and pre briefings most airlines already have procedures for briefings which ad the most important aspects of the approach and landing detailed guidance is provided in fsf alar briefing note safety foundation alar task force the following guidance is not intended to replace those briefings but is an addition to current standard briefing guidance improve overall ala awareness and improve awareness of specific approach and landing risks as demonstrated in the project data simply knowing few overall statistics can raise situational awareness igni fi when company statistics are available they should be referenced however in their absence the following industry statistics can be used alas make up approximately percent of all accidents approximately percent of unstable approaches result in go and more than percent of runway excursions follow stable approach that becomes unstable after threshold crossing additionally reviewing the effects of runway contamination and tail winds on runway excursions is relevant because they contribute to significant number of runway excursions the flight safety foundation runway safety initiative found that about percent of runway landing excursions are veer off of that percentage percent follow stable approaches of all veer percent were associated with wind and percent with runway contamination the remaining per of runway landing excursions are overruns and of that group percent follow unstable approaches safety foundation this project found that awareness of instabilities is crit important in the landing phase as well as in the approach phase some simple rules of thumb regarding the effect of poor landing technique on landing distance can significantly improve situational awareness for example pilots should plan for landing distances to in by ft per second of floating ft per kt excess speed from ref on dry runway ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet runway and ft per ft excess above ft over runway threshold this also applies when the vertical guidance for the ap by design places the aircraft higher than ft agl when crossing the threshold landing distances are based on threshold crossing briefings including these statistics and rules of thumb should occur at intervals that will ensure that flight crews have an in depth awareness of the information for example bi briefings also should discuss any allowances for flight crews to adjust company policies discussion in safe landing guidelines as permitted by guided procedures in the policies themselves for example allowing crew to conduct touchdown beyond the normal approach and landing and pre briefing guidance pre briefing should include in addition to existing approach briefing components an emphasis on approach and landing threats when available company statistics should be used periodically bi the briefing should include approach and landing accident statistics overall statistics alas make up approximately percent of all accidents approximately percent of runway excursions develop from approaches that become unstable after threshold crossing and approximately percent of unstable approaches or unstable landings result in go runway excursion environmental contributors percent of landing excursions are veer with wind factor in percent and runway contam nation factor in percent about percent of veer follow stable approaches and percent of landing excursions are overruns of these percent follow unstable approaches landing distance increase rules of thumb ft per second of floating ft per kt excess speed from ref landing speed on dry runway ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet runway and ft per ft excess above ft over runway threshold for each approach briefing should include environmental ala threats contamination crosswind tail winds go readiness in addition to normal go briefing heightened readiness should be discussed in the event of poor environmental conditions and any adjustments to approach and landing policy requirements as permitted by written policy guidance landing beyond the normal touchdown zone if performance permits pre briefing at an appropriate low period just prior to commencing the approach crews should recap current environmental threats go readiness and any adjustments to go policy procedures source flight safety foundation touchdown zone as long as adequate landing performance and distance references exist finally as pre briefings often occur minutes or more before an approach the project findings and recommend suggest that short update or refreshment of the current threats and go readiness be briefed just prior to the ap during low period in the lower descent this can refresh and up flight crews situational awareness pre approach and landing and pre briefing guidance active communication throughout the approach this project determined that communication is one of the key attributes of effective collaborative decision making by flight crews by factor of approximately four flight crews who comply with their company go policy had comm uni about approach instabilities and for most crews who con an unstable approach and landing no one made the actual decision to continue that is there was no communication about the decision to continue it just happened the difficulty with passive calls which are made only if prob condition exists is that in their absence it is undetermined if the condition exists the call could be absent for several reasons as explained in the report findings active calls however force flight crews to speak discuss or express condition either positive or negative on every approach it is also important not to overload the flight crew with standard communication and to ensure that they have time to listen to atc and perform other tasks therefore active calls must be short and direct calls are usually initiated by the pm and responded to by the pf the pm call on the approach normally indicates condition and the response by the pf may either be an ac or directional response it is recommended that there be an active call at each ap gate if the active call indicates an undesired aircraft state the call should continue to be made periodically throughout the approach at intervals such as each ft or ft until the desired state is achieved or go is conducted this serves the same purpose as warning from egp ws or tcas active repetitive calls in the to zone also pre the pf for an eventual conclusion if the offending co ndi is not corrected that is go repetitive warning calls prime the pf anticipatory compensatory hierarch and relational awareness es as compared with common current procedures in which sudden single go around call is made at or ft which has lesser ef in primarily the hierarchical awareness the implementation of active calls should not imply that passive and communicative calls such as or be omitted passive calls remain an important component of situational awareness and should be used in combination with active calls as required the following are examples of active calls at approach gates during an approach if an airline has stable approach and monitoring system installed such as rop or smart landing the need for complete series of active calls throughout the approach and landing is largely removed these systems apply passive conditional calls however the nature of the automation provides form of

runway centerline that begin at the distances indicated above the width of the aim markings varies with the width of the runway source flight safety foundation fsf safe landing guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind the revised flight safety foundation guidelines for safe landing and achieving reliable go decision making during the landing phase as with the stable approach and go decision guidelines there were several objectives namely that the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and manage to improve agreement with the policy ensure safety during landing by mitigating the common types of alas landing runway excursions and veer ensure the resultant go are in situations of ap risk and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to go maneuver increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on atc and improve the flight crew collective situational awareness the guidelines established here do not replace manufacturer limitations and procedural guidance or state regulations and guidance excursions that occur following an unstable approach are mitigated largely in the approach phase however they can still prevented in the landing phase additionally large numbers of excursions occur following stable approach that becomes unstable only after the aircraft passes the runway thresh guidelines in this section are targeted at these types of excursions landing excursions are of two types overruns in which aircraft run off the end of the runway surface and veer in which aircraft exit the side of the runway surface to address these types of alas we will enhance landing guidelines in four areas longitudinal limit awareness touchdown zone and distance lateral limit awareness centerline environmental variability and adjustments to established policies and situational awareness and communication project findings include that collective situational awareness is low during the landing phase and although most opera have policies defining where the touchdown should occur very few have guidance or sops on how to determine where the touchdown occurs or how and when to determine if go around should be executed for example most operators spec that the aircraft should touch down in the touchdown zone on the centerline however they do not train or specify how to determine if the aircraft has passed the dz who should make the determination or how much of deviation from the runway centerline is permissible before go should be conducted most pilots say either gut feeling or experience helps them judge when an aircraft has passed the acceptable limit even though they readily state that their experience does not include go from the landing phase the impact of improving collective situational awareness in the landing phase can be significant longitudinal limit awareness dz and distance touchdown zones vary in length with one determining factor being total runway length runways of ft and longer have touchdown zones ft long and runways of and longer have touchdown zones long relative positioning markings are present within the dz and are clearly identifiable on non runway the aiming point is the widest marking located at the distance from the threshold and distance from the threshold with the end of the dz being identified by the last marking at ft and approach alerting and monitoring systems such as smart provide aural alerts when an aircraft has passed company touchdown area when an aircraft passes this area without touching down an aural alert such as landing deep landing is given honeywell international sops then dictate go this objective warning immediately enhances crew awareness and leads to better decision making in the absence of such system the pm through sops can be directed to monitor the passing of dz markings and make an active call such as limit landing or of zone after passing the last marking indicating the passage of the dz in cases in which the runway is contaminated and markings are not visible couple of options exist if available runway remaining markers can be used or using the landing distance of thumb pilots can calculate that for an aircraft traveling ft per second the normal touchdown area of to ft will occur in four to eight seconds fps seconds to ft calculations also will show that the end of the dz will pass in approximately seconds ft fps seconds lateral limit awareness centerline most operators specify that the touchdown shall occur on the runway centerline but do not say how this will hap or who will determine when the aircraft is drifting as important as it is to have situational awareness regarding longitudinal limit it is equally important to understand lateral limits manufacturers often provide cockpit visual cues and techniques for determining where the main landing gear is in relation to the aircraft centerline as an example boeing says that for the the view through lower outboard corner of the pilot forward win to the ground is good visual reference for the outboard side of the main landing gear wheels on the same side the lower inboard corner of the pilot forward window is also good reference for the opposite side main gear wheels boeing company in the absence of other lateral limits maintaining the most outboard main landing gears on either side of the centerline is reasonable limit using visual cues as in the example above can help determine the positioning of the main landing gear this is considered rough operational guide with its own limitations however there are no known alternatives other than relying on sense the monitor of this positioning can be performed by the pm during the landing and if he or she sees that the position of the aircraft is incorrect he can make an appropriate call limit in that case sops would dictate go environmental variability and adjustments to established policies environmental variability can have significant effect on land performance and desired touchdown points operators should consider giving flight crews the tools and guidelines to determine when it makes sense to modify or adjust landing and go policies for safety and possibly operational efficiency it can be difficult for some operators to consider allowing crew to land beyond the dz however landing performance combined with sound guidance and policies for operating outside normal definitions makes sense when safe operations are assured over we also have the problem of rules with no room to apply judgment kern said in book of these policies begin with good intent but inside the good intent we create systems that defy logic and poison the well of fairness which often results in an unintended consequence loss of faith in the system of rules problems can develop when environmental conditions are such that operating outside established policies makes sense but there are no guiding principles on how to accomplish this for example an aircraft landing on run requires landing distance although the company policy states that go should be initiated if touchdown does not occur inside the dz is it the best course of action as opposed to an option of extending the touchdown point to ft km for example certainly the answer is yes if the mark is not definable however if the flight crew can identify this point and if they have briefed the revision to the policy is it still the best course of action to go around in this case the transfer of risk to go is questionable revised touchdown point can be determined by citing known distance point along the runway taxi marking runway distance marker or time period one second approximates ft in distance in another case in which weather and runway conditions demand that touchdown occur before the end of the dz guid should give crews the methods and means to identify the shorter touchdown limit for example if the crew wants to be touching down within ft of the runway thresh they need references to determine where this will occur using dz markings or time lapse seconds from the time the aircraft crosses the threshold in any case written policies and guidance must be in place to give the flight crew permission procedures and techniques to modify landing point limit this should be briefed and agreed upon by all crew figure approach and landing gates and active calls end of dz of zone of zone deep landing window stabilized go window stabilized not stabilized window con not con dz touchdown zone calls can be substituted with auto callout such as minimums above source flight safety foundation situational awareness and communication figure shows examples of new active com munic calls recommended in the landing phase of flight in the case of exceeding centerline touchdown limit it is difficult to define point in the dz where positive centerline active call can be made although not ideal in this case the use of passive call may be more operational that is the call is made only when the drift limit is reached note that stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems accomplish the objectives of some active calls therefore flight crew calls would not be required fsf recommended elements of stabilized approach reference recommended elements of stabilized approach all flights must be stabilized by ft above airport elevation in instrument meteorological conditions and by ft above airport elevation in visual meteorological conditions an approach is stabilized when all of the following criteria are met the aircraft is on the correct flight path only small changes in heading are required to main tain the correct flight path the aircraft speed is not more than ref kt indicated airspeed and not less than ref the aircraft is in the correct landing configuration sink rate is no greater than fpm if an approach re sink rate greater than fpm special briefing should be conducted power setting is appropriate for the aircraft configuration and is not below the minimum power for approach as defined by the aircraft operating manual all briefings and checklists have been conducted specific types of approaches are stabilized if they also fulfill the following instrument landing system approaches must be flown within one dot of the glide slope and localizer category ii or category iii ils approach must be flown within the expanded localizer band during circling approach wings should be level on final when the aircraft reaches ft above airport elevation and unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions requiring deviation from the above elements of tabi liz ed approach require special briefing an approach that becomes unstabilized below ft above airport elevation in imc or below ft above airport elevation in vmc requires an immediate

support with question concerning grounding and bonding of aircraft fueling trucks during fuel servicing or de fueling operations the customer stated that the ramp at his airport is being repaved and grounding points are not being re installed in recent years there has been change in philosophy and practice with regard to grounding in the edition of the national fire protection association standard for aircraft fuel servicing the requirements for ground ing were deleted and requirements for bonding were clarified the practice in the united states has been to bond and ground but tests have proven that if the aircraft and fuel truck are properly bonded grounding wire carries no electrical charge at all this is why nfpa no longer specifies grounding for safety during aircraft fueling the nfpa determination was based on the following points grounding does not prevent sparking at the fuel surface grounding is not required per nfpa recommended practice on static electricity static electrical grounding points can have high resistance making them unsuitable for grounding the wire used for grounding might not be capable of conducting current in the event of an electrical fault in the ground support equipment connected to the aircraft and could become an ignition source if the wire fuses the gulf stream ground handling and servicing handbooks and aircraft maintenance manuals

has been brought to our attention by aircraft operator with the aircraft powered down and the battery ci cuit breaker closed depressing one of the entry light switches causes the controller to power up on aircraft atte ry power initiate minute countdown timer and turn on the associated light within the aircraft the deviation between the electrical drawing note and actual op ration comes about as result of the length of time that the switch is depressed the entry light switches are momentary switches that complete the circuit as long as the switch is depressed momentary tap second on one of the entry light switches completes the circuit long enough for the controller to recognize the request to power up in battery mode however by the time the operating system and application software are both running the active low signal through that entry light switch is no longer present result in in case where the countdown timer and location breakfast minutes november light are unable to turn on as both of these functions are controlled from within the application software troubleshooting revealed that if the initial switch press lasts for three to four seconds there is sufficient time for the controller to complete the boot cycle such that the os and application software are up and running once the application software is running the switch input can be recognized enabling the countdown timer and determ inin which light switch was depressed to close the appropriate contact that turns the light on altern ative ly if the controller is powered up with the momentary press on the entry light switch and is fo lowed up with second pr ess couple of seconds later that the application software is running the countdown timer is initiated and the corresponding light is turned on the resulting action of single momentary tap of an entry light switch is the controller would be powered up on the battery without the count down timer being initiated that would eventually turn it

The Missed Approach – Hey Where’s the Runway?1Missed Approach SegmentA Missed approach is a procedure used when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing The Missed Approach Segment is that part of an instrument approach procedure between the missed approach point (MAP), the missed approach way-point (MAWP), or the point of arrival at the decision height and the specified missed approach NAVAID (navigational aid), intersection, fix, or waypoint, as appropriate, at the minimum IFR altitude It is in this part of the approach procedure that the aircraft will climb and return to the en route structure or is positioned for holding or subsequent approach The missed approach route and altitudes are shown on the instrument approach charts2The Missed ApproachThe missed approach is one of the most difficult and critical phases of an instrument approach and is the one practiced the least High workload, as the configuration of the aircraft must be changed (approach to climb out), coupled with new navigation route/Navaids An approach in actual conditions should be flown with the anticipation that the missed approach is an anticipated outcome The missed approach procedure typically includes an initial heading or track to follow, and an altitude to climb to.  This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix Be sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach FAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed: 1.  Whenever: Flight visibility is less than the specified visibility for the approach If required visual references are not seen at either of the following times:  When the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or Upon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DA/DH where a DA/DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that until touchdown. 2.  Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References FAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA: The approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable The threshold The threshold markings The visual approach slope indicator The threshold lights The runway end identifier lights (REIL) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings The touchdown zone lights The runway or runway markings The runway lights Basic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting 6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible Full scale needle deflection past the final approach fix Navigation equipment required for the approach fails ATC instructs you to go missed Unsafe runway Traffic Controller or pilot navigation errors Weather – e.g., thunderstorm cell When the aircraft is being operated below MDA – loss of visual references If your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure A controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions Verbal Missed Approach Instructions ATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach ATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required ATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency]. Be advised [Traffic...]“ If executing instructions different from those on the procedure as dictated by approach, call “on the go\" or \"executing climb out\" to reduce confusion 9Missed Approach Chart SymbolsTo provide ready missed approach guidance, approach plates use quick reference icons Due to limited space only four or less icons can be shown. Hence the icons may not show the entire missed approach procedure The full missed approach instructions are provided textually at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing10JEPP Missed Approach Chart Symbols11NACO Missed Approach Chart Symbols12Climb to altitudeTurn to specified headingTo Specified fixTrack RadialMissed Approach Point LocationThe missed approach point (MAP) on a non-precision approach is\\u2009not designed with any consideration to where the\\u2009aircraft must begin descent to execute a safe landing It is developed based on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and possibly air traffic considerations Descent below the MDA, including during the missed approach, is not authorized The Decision Altitude (DA) is an altitude derived location where a missed approach will be initiated on a precision approach Obstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach Decision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). 13Obstacle Protection Obstacle protection is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the DA/H or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA) A climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart When higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix Preplan your approach to ensure you can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile)  Higher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute) Tables for climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are on page D1 of U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets Formula: Required Climb Per Minute = ((_[climb gradient]_ ft/nautical mile) x ([ground speed] nautical miles/hour)/60) = 36,000 feet per hour = 14Beginning the Procedure Other Than at the MAP/DHIn the design of the missed approach procedure no consideration is given to an abnormally early missed approach turn from the approach course When an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC,  Fly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point  Remain at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver Can begin climb early, absent altitude restrictions Think CFIT when making an early missed!!15Circling Approach MAPExecuting the missed approach after starting the circling maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP The missed approach is executed for the runway the approach started on, not the runway you were circling to The initial turn on a missed approach will always be towards the landing runway until established on a segment of the missed approach Always think about how to execute the missed approach while circling so it is not a surprise if you enter IMC as aircraft is clear of obstacles only when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area16Since the circling missed approach maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost.Flying the Missed ApproachBefore the FAF  Memorize initial altitudes and headings Set up No. 2 Nav if possible for missed approach initial navaid course17Flying the Missed Approach Initial Missed Approach Segment ProcedureAt the MAP / DA Add climb power Rotate gradually (on-speed) to Vx Check for positive rate of climb Clean up the aircraft – gear and flaps up in the order specified by the POH Climb out at appropriate speed18CommunicateUpon execution of a missed approach and becoming stabilized in climb notify ATC If communicating with the Tower - \"[Place] tower, [Callsign], missed approach [Reason]\" If communicating with approach - \"[Place] approach, [Callsign] missed approach off of [Location] climbing through [Altitude] for [Altitude] with request\"19Lost Communications Missed ApproachIf communications are lost during the approach and you take a missed approach: Squawk 7600 Follow the published missed approach instructions to ensure adequate obstruction clearance Route: Proceed to the alternate IAF as filed and commence an approach Altitude: The EXPECTED altitude, if given one, after filing a “DRAFT” or;

The NOTAM will specify both the textual instructions and any additional equipment requirements necessary to complete the procedure You may reject an ATC clearance for an alternate missed approach that requires equipment not necessary for the published approach procedure when the alternate missed approach is issued after beginning the approach However, if the alternate missed approach is issued prior to beginning the approach the pilot must either accept the entire procedure (including the alternate missed approach) or request a different approach procedure22G1000 Missed ApproachAt the MAP, “SUSP” is displayed in the HSI and directly above the SUSP softkey Automatic sequencing of approach waypoints is suspended at the MAP A “FROM” indication is displayed on the CDI, but the course guidance is simply an extension of the final approach course  Do NOT follow this extended course When the message “RAIM is not available” is displayed in the Alerts Window on the PFD a missed approach must also be executed23G1000 Missed ApproachFlying the Missed Initiate the missed approach sequence by following the missed approach procedures as published / directed by ATC, for proper climb and heading instructions If not already using GPS as nav source, press the CDI softkey to switch external CDI output to GPS for guidance.  Press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic sequencing of waypoints If there is a missed approach course from a fix to altitude, Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to resume automatic leg sequencing After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD The G1000 will guide to the missed approach holding point and a recommended entry procedures for the holding pattern will be shown24G1000 Missed ApproachNote that the G1000 at the holding point again displays “SUSP” above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern The G1000 provides course guidance only on the inbound side of the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern to re-fly the approach, press the PROC key to “Select Approach” or “Activate Approach” (or use the Direct-To key to select another destination)  25G1000 Missed Approach Example Missed Approach Course From Fix To AltitudeAfter pressing the SUSP softkey, the missed approach sequence is automatically started with the course from fix to altitude leg After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey -  The G1000 returns to suspend mode when flying a course from a fix to altitude leg and indicates that automatic leg sequencing is suspended Fly the outbound course keeping the CDI needle centered. The Navigation Map Page depicts the flight path extending indefinitely from the Navfix. The distance increases and indicates the distance back to the Navaid Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic leg sequencing. Confirm that ‘SUSP’ no longer is displayed directly above the SUSP softkey The message “NEXT DTK 123” is the displayed, providing guidance to the holding fix. The actual desired track (DTK) depends on the ground speed and distance from the Navaid. Intercept and fly the inbound course, keeping the CDI needle centered As the plane approaches the Navaid (the missed approach holding point), a message in the navigation status bar recommends the holding pattern entry, e.g., “HOLD PARALLEL” Note that the G1000 again displays ‘SUSP’ above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern, press the PROC key to reactivate the approach or select a different approach, or press the Direct-To key to select another destination26G1000 Missed Approach Additional AutomationGA Switch (Go-Around)  Disengages the autopilot Selects the flight director Go-Around Mode, and  Activates the missed approach The GA Switch is located on the instrument panel above the throttle TOGA (Takeoff/Go-Around) Switch Offers automated go-arounds At the MAP, press the TOGA button Keeps the AP engaged Commands a climb Sets Autopilot to NAV mode and  Sequences to the missed approach 27Pitch-up IllusionPitch-up illusion is a significant hazard during the transition to climb out On approach the portion of the inner ear that provides sensory information related to acceleration—provides the sensation of stabilized speed, based primarily on the forces of gravity When acceleration and climb occur simultaneously as during the initial segment of a missed approach, two forces come together - gravity and acceleration The brain resolves the two forces (gravity and acceleration) as a single resultant force acting downward and backward. The brain incorrectly resolves the two forces as a single pitch-up movement When that occurs, the pilot feels as though the aircraft is climbing or that the nose is pitching up, when, in fact, it remains in level flight.   The normal reaction, absent visual clues, to the pitch-up illusion is to push forward on the stick with the risk of ground contact in a missed approach28Common ErrorsFailure to have essential knowledge of the information on the approach chart Failure to have initial steps of missed approach committed to memory Failure to identify DH or MAP or other condition requiring a missed approach Incorrect communication procedures  Noncompliance with ATC clearances, the published missed approach or an ATC instruction or failure to notify ATC of inability to comply Failure to accomplish checklist items Faulty basic instrument flying techniques Failure to accomplished a missed approach timely – e.g. motoring on to look for references29PTS Standards Area of Operation VI.

It’s European equivalent is ED-12B. A document that addresses the life process of developing embedded software in aircraft systems. It is a commonly accepted standard worldwide for regulating safety in the integration of software in aircraft systems.History of DO-178BSoftware in avionics has been around since the 1970’s By adding software to a system, certification becomes more complex. The RTCA creates DO-178 in 1980, while EUROCEA works on ED-35. The merged result is DO-178 / ED-12: the first common certification criteria for production of avionics software.Evolution of DO-178BIn 1985, revisions and updates were made to produce DO-178A / ED-12A. The documents became a worldwide basis for software certification in the aviation industry. DO-178B / ED-12B started in 1989 and finalized in 1992.DO-178B Document LayoutFigure 1-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”DO-178B Software LevelsDO-178B requires that all system requirements be mapped to one of the five software levels.  Level A - most critical failure level.  Failure at Level A results in catastrophic failure conditions for an aircraft.  Level B - the software at this level contributes to severe-major failure conditions.  Level C - software at this level contributes to major failure conditions.  Level D - software at this level contributes to minor failure conditions.  Level E - the software has no effect toward potential failure conditions.DO-178B Processes and OutputsDO-178B is divided into five main processes: Software Planning Software Development Software Verification Software Configuration Management Software Quality Assurance Each process has a set of expected documented outputs.Software Planning ProcessPurpose is to determine what will be done to produce safe, requirements-based software. Expected outputs: Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC) Software Development Plan Software Verification Plan Software Configuration Management Plan Software Quality Assurance PlanSoftware Development ProcessThe software development process is broken into four sub-processes: Software Requirements Process High-level requirements in relation to function, performance, interface and safety. Software Design Process Low-level requirements used to implement the source code. Software Coding Process Production of source-code from the design process. Integration Process Integration of code into a real-time environment.Software Development Process Continued…The following tangible outputs are the result of the combined four sub-processes: Software requirements data (SRD)  Software design description (SDD)  Source code  Executable object codeSoftware Verification ProcessThe purpose is to identify and report any errors resulting from the development process. The verification process objectives can be met with reviews, walkthroughs, unit testing, integration testing, and more. Proof of objectives is within the execution of the testing procedures. Outputs include: Software Verification Cases and Procedures Software Verification ResultsSoftware Verification Process Continued…Figure 6-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”Software Configuration Management ProcessThe purpose is to establish secure and effective configuration control for all artifacts. The following activities are done within the process: Configuration Identification Change Control Baseline establishment Archiving of the software Outputs include: Software Configuration Index, and Software Life Cycle Environment Configuration Index.Software Configuration Management Process (Continued…)Figure 7-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”Software Quality Assurance ProcessThe purpose is to provide assurance that the software life cycle process is going to yield quality software. Each process is analyzed to show that each process is producing the expected outputs. Any changes from originally proposed plans are reported, evaluated, and resolved to ensure process integrity.DO-178B Processes: ReviewDO-178B software life-cycle process is divided into five main processes: Software Planning Software Development Software Verification Software Configuration Management Software Quality Assurance The objective-based approach of DO-178B makes it flexible to individual projects.DO-178B CertificationD0-178B very specifically addresses the following which directly affects product development. Certification of a product applies only to it\\'s finished result. Certification includes approval of all systems and subsystems, hardware, software, firmware, development tools, production, and testing of the product. Certification is done on the individual application of the product Coding practices must be certified to ensure things like \"dead code\" are not allowed. Certification requires that \\'full testing\\' of the system and all of it\\'s components (including firmware) be done on the target platform in the target environment. Certification requires code testing at the MCDC level.The Future of DO-178CThe evolution of avionics software has forced a change upon the certification process. DO-178B was written absently in mind of older software tools. Advanced technologies and the growing complexities of newer avionics software needs to be addressed.The Future of DO-178CA committee has formed on behalf of the two major contributors (RTCA and EUROCAE) to produce DO-178C / ED-12C. Work has been started as of March 2005 and looks to be finished and published in December 2008. The document looks to tackle the introduction of new software development techniques among other things. I’m sure we’re all looking forward to it.References and Works CitedAvista Incorporated®, “DO-178B Basic Overview.” 7 July 2004.
