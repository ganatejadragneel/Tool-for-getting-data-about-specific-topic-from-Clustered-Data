The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The boundaries of the flight envelope will be defined within this document. All speeds are calibrated airspeeds (CAS) (requirement 4.4 ) and given in knots if not stated otherwise. All other units used are metric (SI units). The weights are given in mass units (kg) but the formulas require force units as input, therefore these are calculated in place wherever they are used. Note: The speeds defined within this document should be used for the placards, speed markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by flight test.

Maximum speed in level flight VH According to flight tests  at maximum weight and maximum continuous power at sea level conditions, the maximum speed in level flight has been determined:  Stall speeds VS, VS0, VS1 These speeds will be verified by flight test according to requirement 4.4.1 .  In order to calculate the stall speed, the maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane as a whole is determined first. The maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane has been calculated starting from the polar curve of the wing profile taken form ref.  (p. 236, Re=2.9E6 flaps retracted  and p.237,  for the flaps in landing configuration, and  in take-off configuration). Considering the horizontal tail balancing force and the lower total wing lift due to wing lift distribution, the total aeroplane lift coefficient has been lowered by 15% with respect to the one of the profile.   Therefore aeroplane lift coefficient is estimated to   and for the landing configuration (since the span extension of the flaps is half of the span of the wing):  Stall speeds have been calculated based on these calculated lift coefficients. The wetted wing area SW is used instead of total wing area S because of a lower lift within the fuselage section of the span. Flaps retracted (take-off configuration):  Flaps extended (landing configuration):  Flaps extended (take-off configuration):  With . The stall speed in landing configuration (flaps fully extended to 40 degrees) is 44 kts. Therefore it is In accordance with CS-LSA.5 . In Take-Off configuration (flaps extended to 20 degrees) the stall speed is 47 kts. (Note: These speeds are estimates. The methods for the estimation can be various. It is important that these estimations are as precise as possible. Flight tests will be used to validate the stall speeds. In case the flight tests show different values, this might have an impact on the speeds used for design and ultimately might impair the compliance to the CS-LSA.5.)  Design manoeuvring speed VA According to requirement 5.2.4.1     Flaps maximum operating speed VF According to requirement 5.2.4.2 , such speed shall be not less than the greater of      and   The speed has been selected as:            This is the maximum flap operating speed for the take-off (at 20 degrees) and landing flap settings at 40 degrees. Flaps maximum extension speed VFE On this aeroplane the maximum flap extension speed is identical to the flap operating speed VF.  This speed is the maximum speed for flaps in take-off and landing configuration. Design cruising speed VC According to requirement 5.2.4.3    may not be less than:  and need not be greater than:  The speed has been selected as:  (Note:  can be selected to be higher than  .) (Note:  and VDF ,VD ,VNE correlate with each other. should be selected to allow for a minimum margin of 22% to VDF in order to be able to satisfy the requirements for the next subchapters.) Design dive speed VD According to requirement 5.2.4.4   For  a higher value than the one above has been chosen:  (Note: ASTM F2245-12d 5.2.4.4  requires an exact value for the dive speed. Indeed, such value should be understood as a minimum value. This will be clarified in the next amendment of the CS-LSA.)  Demonstrated dive speed VDF According to requirement 4.1.1.1  VDF must be less than or equal to VD. In this case VDF is equal to VD:  (Note: In case the demonstrated VDF is lower than VD then VNE needs to be limited accordingly which could have an impact on the selection of VC as well.) Never exceed speed VNE According to requirement 4.1.1.2  the VNE Shall be greater than or equal to:  and  must be less than or equal to:  The speed has been selected as:  Note: If the aircraft is equipped with retractable landing gear then VLO must be determined as well (CS-LSA.15 6.12.2). Altitude The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. In fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)

Table 2 \\u2013 Manoeuvring limit load factors  Gust envelope Gust load factors need to be considered because they can exceed the prescribed maximum load factors at different weights and altitudes. Since gust loads depend on air density and aircraft mass they will be calculated for all twelve cases (sea level and 10000ft=FL100, maximum, minimum flying weight and minimum flying weight with full wing fuel tanks) according to requirement 5.2.3.3  with flaps retracted (requirement 5.2.6.1 ) and fully extended (requirement 5.2.6.2 ) at . The calculation is based on appendix X3 . To calculate the gust loads at altitudes other than at sea level the formula X3.1  is altered to include the density at sea level  as well:  The corresponding weights are defined within . Since the gust loads on the wing and tail have been chosen to be treated together,  is the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane ().

This specific one is corresponding to MTOW and FL100. For other design weights the shape of the envelope remains similar, with the difference that the gust lines will change (due to different load factors as per Table 3).

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. Within this document the loads on the wings are determined throughout the whole flight envelope  and for the design weights as determined in  under all loading conditions. The simplified criteria of requirement X.1  have not been used for these calculations. The Loads are calculated using literature methods taken from the documents referenced in chapter 1. The following assumptions are made: Applicable to LSA only; no compressibility effects; conventional configuration (e.g. no tandem aircraft, bi-plane or canard); no pitching moment of the horizontal tail (symmetrical profile); no winglets, no wing tip tanks; no sweep, straight leading edge, no twist, constant profile, no dihedral; effect of the wing deformation on the loads not considered; no spoilers or airbrakes; landing gear attached to fuselage;  no wing struts (cantilever wing);     References List of Abbreviations CG centre of gravity LE leading edge ISA international standard atmosphere by International Organisation for Standardisation  KEAS knots equivalent airspeed MAC mean aerodynamic chord MTOW maximum take-off weight SI international system of units  angle of attack of the wing [deg]  local angle of attack of the station i [deg]  wing zero lift angle of attack [deg]  profile zero lift angle of attack [deg] a lift curve slope [1/deg] AR wing aspect ratio calculated by  [] b wing span [m]  average wing span at station i (mid span position of station) [m]  wing span position of MAC [m]  average fuselage width at wing section [m]  maximum fuselage width (equals ) [m]  local angle between resulting force and normal force at station [deg]  average chord at station i [m]  mean aerodynamic chord [m]  chord at wing root  [m]  chord at wing tip [m]  shear axis relative position as a fraction of local wing chord []  drag coefficient  []  lift coefficient  []  fuselage pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift profile pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient [] D drag force on the wings [N] d span wise drag line loading []  wing sweep of the quarter chord line [deg]  g gravity acceleration [m/s2]  fuselage moment factor []  total wing lift force (on both wings) [N]  local lift at station i [N]  lift line loading on the wing [N/m]  total horizontal tail lift force [N]  total fuselage length [m]  fuselage length in front of wing quarter mean aerodynamic chord point [m]  taper ratio (equals  ) []  wing pitching moment with lift acting on its aerodynamic centre [N]  moments around y axis [Nm]  normal force [N] n load factor [] num total number of stations of a single wing; num = 10 []   density of ambient air at a specific altitude []  running horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  incremental horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  running vertical shear force at station I (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  incremental vertical shear force at station i (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  local resulting force at station i [N] S wing area (not including wing carry-through) []  local tangential force at station i [N]  total torsion around elastic axis of the wing (at wing root) [mN]  local torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  incremental torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  dynamic viscosity (for Reynolds number) [] v airspeed [m/s] W total aircraft weight [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload)  [kg/m2]  total weight of a single wing (with no fuel or payload) [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload) [kg/m2] x longitudinal axis of the aircraft [m] distance to HT quarter chord line from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to aircraft centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to fuel centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE at station i [m]   aerodynamic centre shift due to fuselage pitching moment [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing-fuselage combination with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing fuselage combination from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord)  [m]    shear axis of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m] y lateral axis of the aircraft (span wise direction) [m]  average wing span position at station i [m]  spanwise width of station i [m] z vertical axis of the aircraft [m]  Throughout this document SI-units are used with speeds expected as m/s and angles in degrees if not stated otherwise. Requirements This document covers the following certification specifications requirements: Table 1 \\u2013 Requirements   Input data The values shown below are derived from design data or other compliance documents for this particular aeroplane.   Load Calculation  The following steps have been followed: Load cases: First, the load cases have been identified in, in terms of weight, centre of gravity, speed, load factor, flap/aileron position, Altitude.  External Loads on the wing: for all load cases, the loads on the wing are calculated; Internal Loads in the wing: for the same load cases the internal loads in the wing (shear, bending moment, torsion) are calculated considering also the effect of the inertia of the wing;  Load cases Table 3 comprises all load cases corresponding to the points of the flight envelope  and design weights and centres of gravity .  Important:  Loads corresponding to flap deflected are considered not critical for the wing and will not be calculated in this document (flap loads will be calculated instead for the flap verification). Loads corresponding to landing conditions are considered not critical for the wing (since the landing gear is attached to the fuselage and no tip tanks or other large masses under the wing) and will not be calculated in this document. For the gust load calculations the wing and horizontal tail are treated together according to X3.1 in ref. . The resulting gust load accelerations are therefore calculated using the slope of the lift curve of the aeroplane (see also ) and treated as balanced flight conditions within this document.  Note: These assumptions have been considered realistic for this aeroplane but they are not of generic validity. It is the responsibility of the applicant to define the set of assumptions which can be acceptable for the particular aeroplane.   Altitude: The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. in fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)

Loads on the aeroplane Reference axes and sign convention  Figure 2 \\u2013 Aeroplane reference axes The origin is located at the airplane axis of symmetry (x axis) with the y axis passing through the leading edge of the mean aerodynamic chord section of the wing. Symmetrical flight conditions The loads on the wing structure arising from symmetrical flight manoeuvres according to requirements 5.2.2 and 5.2.3  are determined within this chapter.  The following abbreviations are used within this chapter (all measurements with respect to wing leading edge at wing mean aerodynamic chord, forces acting according to arrows are positive) x longitudinal axis of the aircraft z vertical axis of the aircraft CG aircraft centre of gravity HT horizontal tail L lift force on the wings  horizontal tail balancing force (HT lift force)  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient (lift force assumed to act on  )  total pitching moment (must be zero for equilibrium) n W aircraft total weight force (= m*n*g )  distance to HT quarter chord line (of HT MAC as quarter chord line)  distance to aircraft centre of gravity  distance to wing fuselage combination centre of pressure   (lift force acting on not generating any pitching moment)  distance to wing fuselage combination aerodynamic centre   (lift force acting on generating constant pitching moment ) The external forces and moments acting on the aeroplane in a balanced flight condition have been determined. The\\xa0simplified scheme in Figure 3 is considered. The aeroplane is reduced to the wing and the Horizontal tail.  Figure 3 \\u2013 Aeroplane simplified scheme The following forces are considered and placed in equilibrium:  Lift on the wing; Horizontal tail balancing load according to requirement 5.2.2.1 ; Weight of the aeroplane; For the calculation of the equilibrium, the z-axis of the aeroplane is assumed aligned with the direction of the gravity. In a second stage (section 6.4), once the forces are calculated, the corresponding angle of attack will be considered for the calculation of the correct direction of the forces on the wing;  Influence of thrust and drag (of the total airplane) are considered negligible at this stage of calculation of the vertical forces. The effect of the drag will be considered in a second stage on the wing only; The wing lift is assumed to act on the aerodynamic centre of the wing as a starting point. The contribution of the fuselage is accounted for as a shift of the point of aerodynamic centre. This is better explained in section 6.1.5. The HT lift is applied at 25% of the chord; Effects of structural flexure are considered negligible; Angular accelerations are disregarded until the aeroplane has attained the prescribed load factor (according to requirement 5.2.2.3 ); Note: The assumptions above provide a clear simplification to the calculations. The fact that they are used here does not mean that they can always be used. It is the responsibility of the designer to make the appropriate assumptions and to agree them with the Agency. Based on the above assumptions the following equilibrium equations are set. The basis system of equations include 4 equations with the following unknowns: L: wing Lift (including fuselage) CL: wing lift coefficient LHT: HT lift XAC f+w: aerodynamic centre w+f (wing + fuselage; see sec. 6.1.3 and 6.1.5) Equilibrium of moments  (f. 6.1.2.1) Equilibrium of forces   (f. 6.1.2.2) wing pitching moment   (f.6.1.2.3) (for wing) wing lift coefficient  (f. 6.1.2.4) Aerodynamic centre The aerodynamic centre is a characteristic of the wing and it is defined as the point about which the pitch moment does not change with changes of the angle of attack throughout the linear range of the lift curve.  According to  the aerodynamic centre can be estimated by adding a correction factor (shift) to the quarter chord point of the mean aerodynamic chord. The correction factor is a function of the maximum thickness of the profile which in this wing is 16% of the chord. For a tapered wing, the mean aerodynamic chord corresponds to the mean chord and it is  (see ). For this wing the correction factor is 0.012 (from Fig.2  at 16% thickness), so the mean aerodynamic centre of the wing without fuselage is    (f. 6.1.3.1) Pitching moment of the wing The pitching moment of the profile from two dimensional wind tunnel test data  does not represent the moment of a three dimensional with the profile. The pitching moment of the whole wing is calculated according to DATCOM method 1 (formula 4.1.4.1.a ).  (formula 4.1.4.1.a ) (f. 6.1.4.1) With quarter chord sweep angle of the wing .   Influence of the fuselage The fuselage is assumed to provide negligible lift. On the other hand, its influence on the aeroplane equilibrium is accounted for as a contribution to the pitching moment. In particular the following formula (taken from ref ) provides the shift of the aerodynamic centre of the wing due to fuselage pitching moment.  (f. 6.1.5.1) With  and  as input to the diagram in  yielding  and a correction factor of 1.05 due to low-wing configuration. The shift of aerodynamic centre, due to the fuselage, is calculated as:   (f. 6.1.5.2) Forces and moments acting on the wings In previous chapter the Lift and the lift coefficient have been determined. Having those as inputs, the drag and angle of attack are calculated. Total wing drag coefficient  (FIG. X2.1 of)(f. 6.2.1) Drag force on the wings  (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.2) The angle of attack (using as reference instead of ) for each load case is calculated using the following formula:   (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.3) Where: lift curve slope    (FIG. X2.1 of ) (f. 6.2.4) and the zero-lift angle of the wing is taken as . This value is the zero-lift angle of the corresponding wing profile, taken from ref  (p.236).   The results of this chapter for the load cases highlighted in subchapter 0 are presented within the table below. Table 4 \\u2013 Loads on the aeroplane Unsymmetrical flight conditions Note: These load cases will not be calculated within this revision of the example document.   Wing load distribution After having calculated the total load on the wing, the load distribution is calculated and shown in the following sections. Every load is assumed to act on the span wise centre of each station.  Figure 4 \\u2013 Location of wing stations Wing lift distribution The wing lift distribution is calculated here. The lift contribution of the fuselage is assumed to be zero (this means that the load which would act in correspondence of the fuselage, is shifted externally to the wing) leading to more conservative results on the wing loads since they provide higher bending. Note: Alternatively, the applicant would have to determine the reduction in wing lift distribution at the location of the fuselage and demonstrate the validity of the approach.  Figure 5 \\u2013 Effect of the fuselage, areas A (total lift calculated at the end of this chapter)  and B (total lift according to Schrenk) are of equal size   This approach is based on the approximation described by Schrenk  and requires adjustments: moving the apex of the elliptical distribution from the fuselage centre towards the wing root increasing lift of wetted wing sections to compensate for zero lift of fuselage wing section The formula for wing lift distribution is derived from Schrenk  and is altered to assume zero lift at the wing section within the fuselage as shown below. The formula gives the value of the lift for span unit. \\u201ci\\u201d identifies the individual station.   Figure 6 \\u2013  lift distribution with zero lift at fuselage wing section   ()  (f. 6.4.1.1) Now the lift of the wing section within the fuselage is redistributed across the wetted wing area to achieve conservative results. The lift distribution calculated above is adjusted by multiplication of a correction factor derived from comparison between total lift of the whole wing including the fuselage section and the wetted wing only.  Figure 7 \\u2013 Fuselage wing section lift redistributed across wetted wing stations        or  (f. 6.4.1.2) The lift distribution corresponding to the formula above, gives a value of lift at wing tip which is higher than zero and therefore does not fully reproduce the actual loading (the winglift is normally zero at the tip). Nevertheless this assumption does not give significant changes and yields conservative results. The local angle of attack for the station I, as a result of this corrected Schrenk distribution, is given by the following formula:  (from f.6.2.3 and f.6.1.2.4) (f. 6.4.1.3) Note: FAA AC 23-19A, paragraph 23.301, contains other acceptable methods.   Figure 9 \\u2013 Span wise lift distribution  Wing drag distribution Since the effect of the drag is negligible, when compared to the effect of the lift, the span wise drag distribution has been assumed constant throughout wing span. This is a conservative assumption. The drag loading per metre of span:   (f. 6.4.2.1) Wing and fuel mass distribution The local masses are calculated for each wing station to account for the mass of the structure of the wing including the systems and control surfaces (control systems, and other equipment). It is assumed that the wing has a linear distribution proportional to the chord. At each station the point of application of the mass is 45% of the chord.  Figure 10 \\u2013 Wing mass distribution  Figure 11 \\u2013 Fuel distribution A constant fuel distribution (at a point of application of 20% of the chord) is assumed throughout the fuel tank span.  Table 5 \\u2013 Mass distribution with full fuel Wing torsion distribution At each station, the wing lift is assumed to be acting at the local centre of pressure, which is calculated using the formula:  (from eq. 9.17.(d) )  (f. 6.4.4.1) Where, ci is the chord at each station, cm0_w_i is the pitching moment around the aerodynamic centre of the wing section (it is -0.0436 across the wing from chapter 6.1.4), CL_i is the local lift coefficient and comes from the corrected Schrenk distribution () in 6.1.5. Therefore centre of pressure location is dependent on the local angle of attack. Each station\\u2019s lift force acts on its centre of pressure and imposes torsion around the wing elastic axis which for this aeroplane is located approximately at a constant chord percentage of 30% (see design data - the main spar is approximately at 25% of the chord) throughout the entire wing span with local positions  as local shear centres at the stations. Note: the location of the elastic axis for this wing has been assumed at 30%. It is responsibility of the applicant to determine and justify the location of the elastic axis.  Incremental torsion load on structure at each station with respect to local wing shear centre including contribution of fuel and wing structure inertia forces:   (f..2) Torsion at each station i (with respect to shear centre) is:    (f. 6.4.4.3) Distribution of internal loads The components of the internal loads on the wing structure are calculated in different steps for each station. The flight load factor n is assumed to act in parallel to the direction of the lift force instead of the direction of the normal force (As required by 5.2.1.1 of ref. ). The difference is assumed negligible. The incremental shear load parallel to lift force vector at station i is taking into account also the inertia unloading of the wing   (f. 6.4.5.1) Incremental shear load parallel to drag force vector at station i:   (f. 6.4.5.2) With  representing the width of the station i. The summation of incremental shear loads throughout the stations to obtain the absolute shear loads at station i is presented below. Shear load parallel to lift force vector   (f..3) Shear load parallel to drag force vector   (f. 6.4.5.4) The components of the loads along the normal and tangential directions are derived by using the following formulas and figure:  Figure 12 \\u2013 Forces components on the wing (The tangential force is oriented opposite to the x axis and is therefore positive when directed towards the front of the aeroplane.) Resulting force angle   (f.6.4.5.5)  Shear loads along the directions of:  resulting force  (f. 6.4.5.6)  tangential force  (f. 6.4.5.7)  normal force  (f. 6.4.5.8) With the local angle of attack for the station i as a result of the corrected Schrenk distribution given by the following formula:  (from f. 6.4.1.4) Summation of shear loads to obtain the bending moments at each station and using the increased lever arm ( instead of  ) at the wing tip station results in slightly more conservative values. Bending moment along normal direction   (f. 6.4.5.9) Bending moment along tangential direction    (f. 6.4.5.10) The results are presented within the graphs and tables below.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The permissible centre of gravity range is dictated by the aerodynamic design requirements for the airplane. Then the centre of gravity locations corresponding to the critical weights are calculated. All units used are metric (SI units) except for airspeeds (CAS) given in knots if not stated otherwise. Note: The values defined within this document should be used for the placards, markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by testing.

The data contained herein is used to establish aeroplane loading limits: Table 2 \\u2013 Mass items (Note: In this document the weight of the empty aircraft is assumed to be determined through direct weighing. Such information might be needed during early phases of the design, when no prototype is available. In this case the weight of the empty aircraft should be determined through estimation. It is important in this case to have a breakdown of the main items in terms of weight and locations, so that the weight can be kept under control and avoid situations where the assumed envelope cannot be achieved.) Aircraft weights The following design weights have been identified since: either they are clearly required by the CS-LSA requirements, or they impose critical loads or flight characteristics. Basic empty weight WBEW The basic empty weight needs to be determined to identify its centre of gravity according to requirement 4.2.3  as empty CG. All load conditions determined within this document are based on the basic empty weight of the aircraft. It includes empty weight of the aircraft and the unusable amount of fuel. Basic empty weight has been determined to WBEW = 366 kg. Note: The basic empty weight must include all equipment for the operation intended including optional avionics packages \\u2013 for example. Basic empty weight (366 kg) vs maximum empty weight WMEW (400kg) According to 4.2.1 of , the minimum useful load  should be 200kg consisting of 172Kg = both seats occupied with persons of 86kg each (4.2.1.1 ) 28kg = fuel for 1 hour flight at  as determined by  (4.2.1.2 ) According to 3.1.2  the maximum empty weight of the aeroplane shall be equal to: . The aeroplane complies with its Basic empty weight including unusable fuel: . Minimum flying weight Wmin (421kg) The minimum flying weight needs to be determined by requirement 4.2.2  and is a design load case leading to highest load factors during gust penetration. It assumes only a pilot of weight of 55 kg.  Minimum full fuel flying weight WminFF (495kg) The minimum flying weight with full fuel is a design load case imposing highest load factors on the fuel tank. This is critical for the fuel tank design and it can be critical also for the wing structure since in this scenario the highest inertia load on the fuel tank introduces torsion about the shear centre in the same direction of the wing aerodynamic load of the wing (the CG of the fuel is forward to the shear centre which is forward to the wing centre of pressure). Maximum zero wing fuel weight WZWF (600kg) The maximum zero wing fuel weight needs to be determined by requirement 5.2.1.3  and is a design load case for the wing loads due to lowest inertia discharge of the wing structure. In this aeroplane this weight equals the Maximum Take-off weight.  Maximum take-off weight WMTOW (600kg) The total aircraft weight must not exceed 600kg regardless whether the aircraft is on ground or in flight. The gross weight of the aeroplane shall not exceed WMTOW = 600kg. The maximum landing weight equals the maximum take-off weight. Loading cases The following loading conditions have been established to identify the critical cases. Table 3 \\u2013 Loading cases for standard configuration   Centre of gravity location The maximum permissible centre of gravity locations are defined within this chapter. Flight limits The maximum permissible centre of gravity range during flight with respect to datum plane is most forward 0.25m   (required by  4.2.3) most rearward 0.39m   (required by  4.2.3) Limitations on ground The most rearward centre of gravity with the plane on ground must not exceed (with respect to datum plane) 0.46m to prevent the aircraft from flipping on the tail although not more than 0.41m might be reached with the most critical loading configuration. Centre of gravity envelope The following table of load cases defines the limits for the certified envelope of centre of gravity locations and the position of load cases of 6.7 within the envelope. Table 4 \\u2013 Load cases on centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration   The centre of gravity envelope covers all valid loading cases.  Figure 1 \\u2013 Centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration Expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification To cover alterations to the aeroplane where need might arise or after certification the aeroplane will be tested and certified against an extended envelope. Additional weights will be added during testing at their corresponding locations to establish the desired loading cases. Table 5 \\u2013 Weights required to achieve expanded envelope for certification   The expanded centre of gravity envelope is defined by the load cases below using ballast weights at their corresponding locations. Table 6 \\u2013 Load cases on expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification Note: The values above are preliminary assumptions. Ballast weights need to be checked to be in accordance with airframe strength limitations and their impact on the flight characteristics in terms of inertia before test flights. This might require narrowing the centre of gravity envelope.

to assist in determining the solution to given in with good understanding of the monitoring process and the interactions among the variables airlines heir own problem diagnosing and cruise performance monitoring has been used for many years by airlines that strive to operate their airplanes as as these airlines know that continuous cruise performance monitoring of airplanes in their can decrease operating costs relative to airlines that do not monitor airplane performance continuous cruise performance monitoring can give airlines the information they need just the baseline performance levels they use for planning and management computer mc fuel predictions so that the correct amount of fuel is loaded on each and every entify normal deterioration for of ch the airplanes that perform best to their longest entify high fuel burning airplanes for possible validate performance degradation for extended twin operations top critical fuel reserves planning lieu of the regulatory requirement of percent fuel mileage deterioration crease crew in plans and possibly decrease the amount of discretionary fuel requested and an less recognized of cruise performance monitoring is diagnosing and solving various airplane performance problems or these case studies show how cruise performance monitoring was used to determine solutions to three different an airline that operates airplane was concerned about what it considered to be ive fuel mileage deterioration relative to the fuel mileage levels its airplanes exhibited when they were the airline requested help from both boeing and the engine manufacturer in te mining what was causing this deterioration the the or through better understanding of the contributions that airframe and engine deterioration make to the overall fuel mileage the airline could more focus its maintenance to help resolve this the airline proposed an experiment involving an engine exchange airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration by dave flight operations and carolyn aerodynamics engineer aero quarterly ew total fuel mileage diff ence ol to ne airplane using he ol an ne engine between an old and new six which was operating about percent below the planning database level of fuel represented the old while soon represented the new the airline requested assistance and support from boeing and the engine manufacturer in carrying out the which sure pre fuel mileage on both the new and the old airplane swap all four engines between the new and old sure fuel mileage again on both the new and the old airplane by using the same physical set of four engines on two different the and the engine manufacturer agreed that any measurable difference in fuel mileage for the same set of engines on two different airframes could be attributed to airframe effects alone that drag position was that proper maintenance of the exterior of an airplane would lead to minimal amounts of drag deterioration as an airplane as the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including so that it would be considered as having properly maintained exterior before the engine control surfaces were seals were and one engine was minor leak in the pneumatic discovered during the was not by the airline to cause about percent penalty in fuel fuel mileage data was collected before and after the to determine any change across the especially to quantify any changes resulting from rigging the control surfaces and replacing any worn fuel mileage improved percent after the with percent attributed to proper rigging of the controls and percent attributed to the changing of one fuel mileage data was then collected on both the old and new airplanes before and after the engine the data collected was combination of in data collected by the airplane condition monitoring system acm and hand data that was collected under more controlled test average results from all four sets of data were then compared to determine the differences in fuel mileage between the old and new airplanes with the same set of for both the old and new the average improvement in fuel mileage for the new airframe relative to the old airframe was about the initial conclusion could be that the older airframe must contribute about percent toward the overall fuel mileage deterioration originally observed on the old airplane and engine about percent of that difference is of the total calculated difference of the pneumatic duct leakage discovered on the old airplane during the contributed about in the old airplane did not have the same revised vertical fairing as the new if the older airplane had had the newer vertical it is estimated that the fuel mileage would have improved about after adjusting for the pneumatic system leak and the newer vertical for the same set of engines the old fuel mileage averaged about percent worse than the new the results are supportive of the position that the drag deterioration of well airplane most likely will not exceed more than about the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including ration

checked baggage would be weighed whenever ar checked baggage weight allowances would be the average passenger weight allowances are higher than the kg per passenger the airline had been because the data sent to boeing for the two winglet airplanes was collected prior to june it was based on the lighter weight allowance of kg per investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the aero quarterly the analysis was based on data using combination of the weight as the investigation the airline sent additional data to boeing for the same two winglet airplanes but only for conditions recorded after june based on the higher jar weight the airline also included data for one more winglet as well as for three winglet the data for the two winglet airplanes showed an immediate fuel mileage improvement of about percent for each based on analyzing only the data from ar weight allowances collected after june this result led quickly to the belief that the previous kg per passenger weight allowance was too although both the fuel mileage and thrust required changed between data based on kg per passenger and data based on ar passenger weight the thrust fuel consumption tsf hardly errors in the estimated weight of an airplane present themselves as high or low drag but do not affect the fuel tsf deviations calculated by apm improvement was observed for both of the winglet airplanes originally analyzed with data recorded before june the results for all six airplanes were still not as good as what boeing experience indicated for this further investigation determined that this airline operates its of in mix of both scheduled and holiday charter using the ar weight allowances called out for the data sent to boeing for the six airplanes included mixture of data from both these types of the average passenger weight allowance recommended for scheduled service is kg per passenger and kg per passenger for charter service are higher than the kg per passenger originally used by the at the airline separated all of the post june data into two charter service and scheduled the data for each group was reanalyzed separately and the analysis revealed discrepancy in demonstrated fuel mileage and thrust levels between the charter and scheduled if airplane weight is perceived airplane performance will be poorer than weight that is unaccounted for shows up as increased airplane drag and decreased fuel in this the tsf deviations remained consistent between both sets of but the thrust deviations increased for the charter strong indication of unaccounted airplane in this boeing proposed that the jar passenger weight allowances as recommended for holiday charter were underestimating the airplane weight for this particular charter although the airline was receptive to the possibility that the ar passenger weight allowances might be too light for its holiday charter it was not fully the airline believed that the ar weight allowances for scheduled could just as easily be in which case their airplanes were performing as poorly as the charter data to determine which weight allowances were the airline and boeing agreed to collect delivery performance data on the next new airplane with production blended winglets the advantages of collecting delivery data as opposed to in data he performance level of the airplane could be established at he airplane would be weighed at the boeing factory with all the weight changes following weighing but preceding delivery accurately tracked and published in the weight and balance the delivery empty weight could be considered delivery are with minimum so the issue of passenger weight allowances would not after collecting cruise performance data on the delivery the airline would continue with its standard in data collection on both scheduled and charter comparing the results from the delivery with the results obtained in would help determine which jar passenger weight allowances gave the airline more accurate airplane gross if the weight allowances were too heavy airplane was actually lighter than then the in performance would appear to be better than the delivery if the weight allowances were too light airplane was heavier than then the in performance would appear to be worse than the delivery the airline provided boeing with the weeks of acm in data for the airplane following separating the data for charter and scheduled for this the data was analyzed relative to the most recent with winglets although the delivery results showed the airplane to be slightly better than the demonstrated database the early in charter results show the airplane with an average per fuel mileage percent worse than the demonstrated level unaccounted weight shows up as airplane drag according to the charter the airplane experienced percent increase in thrust required on entering partially offset by percent drop in engine tsf for percent drop in fuel mileage from the delivery when the same ai scheduled service data for the same time period was the fuel mileage was much closer to the delivery average in fuel mileage for the weeks of operation deviated from the delivery level by only percent percent below the demonstrated which is within the acm ability to determine fuel mileage over given time these results supported the conclusion for this the ar passenger weight allo for scheduled more accurately the true weight of the passengers plus carry baggage than the weight allowances recommended for the

resulted from the reinforcement of the wing the results indicated this improve to be relatively small but still worth an average of few tenths of percentage at normal cruise weights and including the effects of both the wing strengthening and the addition of the the fuel mileage and drag improve closely matched their predicted because the improvement in drag is of for given cruise the actual

operation and graphics display will make flying not only will the kln help you to navigate more easily and more its trip planning air data and other useful will make you feel like flying with true flight management kln may be ifr approved for en approach we think find that having an abundance of navigational data to mention moving available to you will make approaches more cise and more guide will be of great help to it is written in simple english and it assumes you are not an experienced user of gps or other type of long range navigation if you are so much the this guide also includes hundreds of sample screen figures and other illustrations to make your learning it is designed so that you can start at the front and progress in the order you may want to skip around and learn things in your own on page there is an index of frequently used procedures which will help you find the page that describes how to do exactly what you want to there are also several appendices in the back of the manual that you may find useful from time to sure to keep this guide handy with you in the it is designed to fit easily in the glove or in the seat the kln is very simple to but the guide can sure be of help to last get so involved in learning to use the kln you forget to fly the be and remember to keep close eye out for other kln sneak if you absolutely wait to use your kln until this this section is for this page will teach you just enough to get going and then learn by this operational view assumes the kln has been properly the unit was previously operational in the same general

system consists of panel mounted kln and ka gps an altitude input is required to obtain full navigation and operational additional system components may be added or interfaced to the kln which increase its features and some of these optional nts include an external course deviation indicator or horizontal situation indicator and external an altitude an external and external annunciators are required for ifr approach kln panel mounted unit contains the gps navigation gas plasma discharge and all required to operate the it also includes the data base card which slides into the left side of the front ka gps antenna is available for use with the it is designed to always be mounted on the top of the kln has analog outputs to drive the deviation of most mechanical and in the nav mode of the fc fc fc fc fc and fc flight control systems may be coupled to the kln many other autopilots may also be coupled to the kln actual autopilot performance and capability when coupled to the kln may vary significantly from one autopilot model to may be provided to the kln from an encoding ter or blind altitude is used as an aid in position determination when not enough satellites are in all ifr installations require remote annunciators to be mounted in aircraft panel in order to select and indicate the status of certain kln en route and terminal ifr certifications require annunciators for message and point alert precision approach certifications also require to select and display when the approach mode is armed or each kln system includes configuration module which attached to the kln mounting the module allows the kln to be configured for the unique characteristics of your equipment parameters that are set by the configuration module the kln may be used for ifr operations or if it may be used for approach ifr kln may only be used for vfr or not the altitude alert function in see section or not an external fuel management system is interfaced to the kln see section or not an external air data computer is interfaced to the kln see section conditions for the aircraft bus voltage alert to see section configuration information is stored both in the module and in kln internal if the kln detects difference between the configuration stored in the module and the configuration stored in the internal memory should only occur following the exchange of kln or kln the configuration information will automatically be updated to the configuration specified in the configuration an error is detected in the configuration warning stating configuration mem will be

north data base coverage americas south data base coverage overlap in americas north americas south data base coverage figure kln data base geographical region kln ata base chapter data base data basics the data base provides two primary it makes pilot interface with the gps sensor much rather than having to manually look up and then enter the latitude and longitude for fic it allows you to merely enter simple point the data base automatically looks up and displays the tude and longitude associated with the it should be obvious that the data base saves lot of tedious entry and also greatly reduces the potential for data input second function of the data base is that it serves as very means to store and easily access aeronautical want to know the name of the the nearest or the airport just unleash the power of the kln and display the information right on the the kln data base stores approaches their proper this allows you to select an approach as rather than entering the approach point by data base contents and coverage areas there are four data base coverage areas available for the kln they are referred to as the data the data the data and the data international civil aviation organization and break the world into the ten geographic regions shown in figure the kln americas north data base tains aeronautical information for the group of icao regions consisting

accepted reference for the in almost all cases the proper icao identifiers may be taken directly from or nos aeronautical identifiers in the contiguous united canada are special cases in the icao many airport rs for these areas have four letters beginning with prefix letter that corresponds to the geographic area in which it is the prefix letter for the contiguous is the identifier for worth international airport is not dfw would be identical to the vor the identifier for orlando executive airport is while the vor identifier is the prefix letter for canada is and for alaska is there are several exceptions in in many ports with three letter identifiers receive the prefix but there are many that the most reliable method of determining an alaska airport identifier is to look it up from the airport name or see tion points by name or you can program the kln to default to certain letter as when you are entering point see section to learn about this handy all airport identifiers receive the prefix airport identifiers which are combinations of letters and numbers do not apply to the prefix examples of airport identifiers not using the prefix are and if you are entering or looking for an airport that is all letters then it will begin with prefix in the contiguous in alaska some or in if there are numbers in the identifier then prefix is not for other areas of the world the airport stored in the kln data base is identical to how it is updating the data base the information stored in the data base would eventually become obsolete if there some means to update for new airports navaids can move or change tion frequencies can and on and chapter by faa you are required to have data base in order to use the kln for data base is contained in small card which plugs into the side of the kln front it is designed so that there are two ways for the user to easily keep the data base the first is to electronically update the data base by means of diskette supplied by honeywell and an personal this method does not have to involve removing the kln from the instrument usually mounted in the instrument provides means of interfacing the kln with the computer via an interface the diskettes are not returned to second method of data base update is to remove the old and insert current this method involves returning the old card to honeywell receives new from en this information is processed and loaded onto both diskettes and data base honeywell makes these two types of update services available to you in choice of several subscription or random update see section for details on these sends the update so that it arrives prior to the effective the new update may be installed any time prior to the effective date and the kln will use the previous data up to the effective date and automatically begin using the new data on the effective the accuracy of the data base information is assured if it is used before the end of the effectivity use of out of date data base information is done entirely at the own computer updating of the data base update information is sent to you on in order to use update program you must have access to computer having disk drive capable utilizing megabyte high density this computer also needs to have an available com or com ial if you wish to perform updates in the an optional pc interface kit must be included in the kit is an interface cable that plugs into both the computer and into the data loader the data loader jack is included with the kln installation kit and is typically installed in the instrument ata base chapter data chapter the data base must be updated only while the craft is on the the kln does not perform any navigation function while the data base is being since data base update takes approximately minutes it is good idea to turn off all electrical equipment on the aircraft except for the kln to avoid running down the aircraft diskettes sent to you can only be used to update kln although they can update that specific unit numerous the first time the diskettes are used in an update unique identification code from the kln being used is uploaded to the these diskettes may be used in this specific kln an unlimited number of times which could be required if you switch back and forth between the americas americas and pacific data bases during one update these diskettes may be used to update other kln this update protection ensures that en sanderson is properly compensated for the use of their update the kln data base by the pin female connector end of the interface cable into com serial port of the if the computer has com and com serial either may be some computers use pin com serial port connector while other computers use pin if the computer being used has pin

about the engine other or even these phenomena are not simulated in the kln approaches and and approaches and this is the last chapter on the operation of the kln in this chapter you will learn how to use the kln for approach and note that only kln which are configured for ifr approaches are capable of performing the procedures discussed in this kln which are figured for en route and terminal operations only will give you access to procedures but not all of these procedures require that you are comfortable with the operation of the unit as presented up to this in you need to be comfortable with flight plan operation and and the obs mode approach operations flying approaches using the kln are not in selves very it is different than using traditional equipment such as and with this in make sure that you practice with the kln in vfr weather with check pilot before attempting to use the kln in actual ifr the kln obtains approach information from the data it is extremely important that the data base is the kln is approved for ifr approaches only when the data base is if you attempt to select an approach when the data base is out of you will be given the base in the bottom left portion of the screen as following sections assume that your kln is installed in the aircraft with all of the necessary accessories to fly in most cases this will mean that the craft has external to arm the approach an external annunciator to indicate when message is active and when point sequencing is about to occur will also be in some installations the aircraft will have switch to select which navigation source is displayed on the primary hsi or nav page has been specifically designed to provide most the functions needed for this page an interface that presents pertinent navigation way to access the flight and graphic presentation of the sent position relative to the flight plan you will find this page to be good friend while performing gps based approaches and and there are some approach procedures in the world that not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data therefore it is not possible to use the kln for these it is good flight practice ensure that the kln contains anticipated procedures for the addition to the two course modes and described in there are also two approach these are approach arm and approach the status of the approach mode is ed on an external in most installations the external annunciator will indicate for the approach arm and approach active will be annunciated by the main ence of these modes from the normal en route mode is that the integrity monitoring is set to tighter another difference between these modes and the en route mode is that the cdi scale factor will usually change to nm for arm and will always change to nm when in the apr the arm mode can be selected in two the normal way is that this mode will be selected automatically by the kln when the aircraft is within nm of an airport and an approach is loaded in the flight plan for that it is possible to arm the approach mode at distance greater than nm from the airport by pressing the al gps approach but the kln will not change the cdi scale factor until the aircraft reaches the nm if the gps apr external switch is pressed while the approach mode is then the kln will disarm the approach and change back to en route the cdi scale factor will also change back to the approach can be by simply pressing the gps apr switch the apr mode can only be engaged automatically by the to cancel the apr mode press the external

route of flight that you if you expect radar then the selection of the correct iaf is less important because you will be given vectors to the and will not need to use the kln next presents list of points that make up the review these points to make sure that you have selected the correct if there are more than four points in the approach you can move the cursor up to other points into view by rotating the right outer knob the cursor over add pl and kln will then bring up the pl page and put the sequence of approach points in front of the airport reference point any time during the process of selecting an approach can easily return to the previous step by pressing the points that make up the approach procedure are loaded the flight at the top of the list of approach points is that describes the approach that an example of this is shown on line of figure which indicates that the vor approach for los angeles international airport is in the active flight plan the approach has been entered into the flight plan the kln to make sure that the resulting flight plan if the kln detects any points that are in both the en route tion of the flight plan and the portion that makes up the

figure kln approaches and and the flight plan and delete those en route points that not can only be entered into pl the active if the kln is turned off for more than then the approach is deleted when power is turned back interpreting what you in the example you may have noticed couple of swith somewhat strange the second point of the approach has name that is not normal for this is an example of what are called these are points that are associated with specific they are used to define spot on the ground that does not have normal point in the case of this point is nm from the lax vor on the the fifth point in the approach is another type of terminal in this case this point is the missed approach point for runway this approach applies to both the left and right runways so the letter is used to mean are few other types of terminal points that you will need tobe familiar with to fully understand gps the naming convention for these points are as stands for final approach stands for intermediate stands for course stands for missed approach rw stands for runway this is usually the map for the zzz will be runway number possibly including for for for or for stands for dme arc aaa is the radial that the fix is on from the reference will be letter corresponding to the distance from the reference for is the seventh letter of the alphabet so would be point on the nm from the reference dme arcs greater than nm will have points where the first two characters are the first two letters of the dme the next three characters will be the radial that the arc way point is the rules above and are defined as for runways only one will be replaced with an or for ways that have multiple will be replaced with for for or for the letters will be replaced with either the runway identifier for circling the inbound course to the missed approach point along given radial will be named such that the first letters are the reference and the next two are the dme if the distance is greater than nm the order is for is nm from lax while is nm from the aircraft is not too far from the destination the nav can be used to determine where some of these points are relative to others in the at the time of this all of the nos charts and some en charts do not show the special points that are required for gps for this reason it is good idea to understand what the special points are used for and what they may have also noticed that some points have small at the end of the point the small letter is an aid that we have added to the name of some points to help you recognize important points in the these suffixes are displayed on many of the kln the definitions of these suffixes the initial approach fix of the the final approach fix of the approach the missed approach point of the approach the missed approach holding point for the every approach will have and almost all will have an iaf and missed approach holding another item that you should notice the flight plan is the line that has on it this is what is referred to as fence and the purpose of this line is to tell you approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and kln will not automatically sequence past the point precedes the the point before the fence is always the missed approach the reason that point sequencing is not allowed is that many missed approach procedures require specific actions before going to the missed approach holding point climbing on fixed heading until reaching an changing or deleting an approach loaded into the flight the sequence of points that are retrieved from the data base of the kln define the approach procedures as they are to ensure that the proper path over the ground is it is not possible to either delete or add points to the approach section of the flight to help you see which points are en route points and which are approach the kln does not display colon next to the point number on the pl page if the point is an approach it is only possible to replace the existing approach with another delete the entire approach from the flight replace an existing or delete an the left page displaying the active flight plan turn the cursor on by pressing the cursor so that it covers the approach header at the top the approach once the cursor comes over the approach it will automatically change to read if you in this condition the kln bring up the apt page that corresponds to the current at this point it is ble to select different approach different or you press the button the cursor is over the approach header it will change to read delete if you press the kln vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and remove the entire approach procedure from the active flight if the kln was in the approach arm or the approach active then deleting the approach will cause the kln to change back to en route this means that the cdi scale factor will change back to the default nm example no procedure turn now that you know the basics of inserting an approach into the we can now show the approach operation of the unit by several this first example will use the approach that was loaded into the flight plan in section this example will show how the kln sequences through an approach and what type of and scale factor changes can be the kln will remain in the familiar leg mode so there will be no need to change between leg and obs mode in this refer to the approach plate for this approach to see what the procedure looks this example it is assumed that you are on an active flight with the final destination being the los angeles international it is also assumed that atc will not give you radar vectors during this the vor approach to lax as demonstrated in tion you are within nm of the the kln will ically arm the approach mode and provide the following alt to set the message acts as reminder to make sure the kln is the correct barometric if the barometric information is not then the integrity monitoring provided by the kln will not be as good as it could press to bring up the alt page verify that the barometric pressure is if the kln is interfaced with compatible air data that provides the correct barometric pressure to the kln then the previous message is not displayed and it is not necessary to update the barometric this time the kln will smoothly change the cdi scale factor the external approach annunciator installed in the aircraft will indicate that the approach is in the arm kln approaches and and you approach the kln will provide point alerting on the external annunciator as well as on the screen of the kln once you pass the kln will ically sequence to the next point in the approaches and and may be good time to select the nav this page is especially useful for getting feeling of where you are in the approach the aircraft approaches the the kln will again provide point as the aircraft passes and sequences to the kln will provide message telling you to set the external indicator or to new if desired track is shown on the this value will flash when the external selected course does not match the tk within the aircraft approaches the it is good idea to check over the status of the kln look at the kln screen to verify that leg sequencing is the kln will not transition to the approach active mode if the obs mode is if the kln shares an hsi or cdi with other nav it is also good to verify that the switch is set to the time the aircraft is nm from by the final approach the kln will make prediction to see if integrity will be available at the and at the if the diction indicates that integrity monitoring will be and aim is currently the kln will change the gps apr annunciator to read at this time the kln will also start to change the cdi scale by the time the aircraft reaches the the cdi scale factor will be down to fix is not included in the list of points provided in the data you will need to identify this point by using the along track distances given in the profile view of the approach in this example is located nm from the when the distance to is then the aircraft is at and you can descend to the for this approach procedures require that you add up distances to be able to identify step down vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and kln will again provide point alerting as you approach this is shown on the nav page by flashing active point identifier following steps would need to be performed if missed approach is reaching and not seeing the runway you decide to perform missed the kln will not automatically sequence past the missed approach this is shown on the nav page by not showing any lines connecting points that are past the to perform the published missed approach press to bring up the the default point will be the first point of the missed approach in this case the first point is confirm this point as the direct to point and press reaching the kln will sequence to the next point in the missed approach in this there is no holding pattern published for the missed approach so you can expect further instructions upon reaching atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th example an approach that is quite common is an approach that is based off fan an example of this is the vor rwy approach to clovis new mexico municipal to fly this procedure as published use the following steps and refer to figure for the for this example assume that the aircraft approaches and and approaching from the northeast going the clovis airport with no active flight the approach into the flight plan as described in section in this case there is only one iaf so the kln does not present the option for you to select an in this there is no active flight plan to begin with so the kln will ask to add the approach to pl the area atc tells you to go the vor and clears you for the approach to this is easy to do from the nav page by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning through the active flight plan by turning the inner once is displayed in the scanning window press and then to direct to operation to the distance of nm to the the kln will give the following required select this message provides reminder that to fly course reversal obs mode needs to be note from the approach chart that there is opt arrival sector for this if you are ing within the indicated area there is no need to perform course reversal and you need to ignore this the opt sector is not stored in the data base so it is not possible for the kln to know if course reversal is required or as the kln will always give this message whenever point could be used for course the kln will properly sequence to the to map leg and transition to the approach mode when nm from the you are approaching from any other direction course reversal is required and the obs mode will need to be if the obs mode is not selected before reaching then the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach this is not desirable when performing course reversal so the obs mode must be selected before reaching the kln will only remind you to select obs mode if iaf is the active therefore if course reversal is make sure the iaf is the selected approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and course reversal is then upon reaching perform the appropriate holding pattern entry and set the inbound course on the external cdi or in this example the inbound course is at this point the kln works very similar to al established on the inbound course of switch back the leg when leg mode is selected the is cally made the active point when the iaf and the are at the same is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor this will make the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active the aircraft is nm from the the kln will verify that the proper integrity is if integrity monitoring is available for the then the kln will change to the approach active this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to reaching the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach fix at dme from along the final approach course is not included in the points that come from the data since the distance that the kln is giving you is distance the you will need to mentally figure out when the has reached this is done by looking at the along distances given in the plan view of the in this case the fix is nm from upon reaching this distance you can descend to the for this missed approach is required for this then the steps would be published missed approach procedure for this approach is to make climbing left turn to feet and proceed direct to the in this case will be the default direct to point kln approaches and and is this is the desired point so press to confirm the point and proceed direct to the if atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to the aircraft approaches you will need to select obs mode to stop point sequencing and define the inbound course for the holding if you do not select the obs mode before the aircraft is within nm of the holding then the kln presents message reminding you to select the obs another attempt at the approach is desired after itis necessary to manually change the active when the and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active point to the when you change from obs to make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active example radar for this example we will use the same approach that was used in previous section except this approach will be conducted with the help of radar vectors from approach the aircraft will be assumed to be arriving from the although this does not change the way the approach will be flown using the kln approach has been selected and entered into the flight plan and the aircraft is going direct to vn new mexico as described in section soon as atc mentions radar vectors you should immediately start to think of the obs once given radar change the active point to and select the obs note that it is not important what order these events take it is just as effective to change to obs mode and then change the active point as it is to change the active point and then switch to obs change the selected course on the cdi or hsi to the final approach for this the inbound course is is now possible to watch your progress on the nav page and anticipate when you will be given new headings to fly established on the inbound you will need to change back to the leg mode to allow for proper approach operation and automatic leg for best the change back to leg mode should be made before the aircraft is nm from the it is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor this will make the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active rest of this approach would be flown using the same steps as presented in section and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and example another common type of approach is an approach that is based onan these could be either vor or ndb an example of this type of approach is the vor rwy approach to bowman airport in kentucky the airport identifier for this airport is approaches and and this example assume that the aircraft is approaching lou the nabb passing the nabb you are told to expect the vor approach at you load the approach using the procedure described in section the distance from the present position to the destination airport reaches the kln will automatically arm the approach the cdi scale factor will transition to nm and the kln will provide more sensitive integrity you also press to update the barometric the aircraft is nm from the qm the kln will give message reminding you to select the obs the obs mode is required for the procedure after passing select the outbound course of the external cdi or aircraft is now headed outbound for the procedure as soon you will need to change the active point to the final approach this is done by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning until is displayed in the dow then pressing then pressing the course will still be what is ed on the external cdi or hsi the obs mode selected and as the active it is possible to fly the procedure allow enough distance past to complete the procedure turn and still be nm away before reaching the after completing the outbound portion of the procedure change the selected course to the inbound course of the external cdi or established on the inbound course the leg mode will again need to be selected so that proper approach operation and point sequencing will is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the apt vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th kln approaches and and this makes the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active the aircraft is nm from the the kln will verify that the proper gps integrity is if integrity monitoring is available for the then the kln will change to the approach active this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to point alerting will occur as the aircraft passes the final approach the leg from the final approach fix to the missed approach point will become active and the cdi scale factor will remain at if the auto scale factor was selected on the nav then the scale factor will zoom in on the airport as the aircraft gets closer and closer to the missed approach eventually the map scale changes to following steps are followed if missed approach is missed approach instructions call for climbing left turn to heading of intercepting the course to missed approach holding to fly this with the kln it will be necessary to put the kln into the obs mode and make the active change the selected course on the external cdi or hsi to the aircraft reaches you will need to perform holding pattern entry suitable for this holding pattern and set the selected course to the holding example dme dme arc procedures with the kln are completely different using traditional vor and dme worry because dme arc procedures using the kln are also easier than using traditional this is because the kln guidance around the no more having to watch distance in one place and radial in being dme arc is really whole bunch of approach fixes placed one next to each other to form an very rarely do you actually fly to the beginning of an especially in radar the flight path of the aircraft generally intersects the arc at some once the aircraft is near the it is then possible to turn so that the arc distance is maintained until time to turn to the inbound following example will show how dme arc procedures are using the kln this example approach will be to use the vor rwy approach to the approach plate for this approach is in figure assume that the aircraft is approaching from the north and is in radar assigns the vor rwy turn to the apt page for to select the you select the vor approach and the kln sents the iaf selection page are five choices for the three of these choices you can recognize but the other and are ar and not shown on this these two points are the data base identifiers for the ends of the means dme arc is the radial on which the point and cates the distance of the is the twelfth letter of the alphabet so the indicates that this is dme in similar manner can also be in this example the aircraft is approaching from the north so the iaf will be kln knows that this point is associated with dme once an arc point is the kln determines what radial of the reference vor the aircraft is presently located point is created that is located at the intersection of the sent radial and the dme this point is the first point in the list of points presented on the apt page before approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the approach into the flight this point is named using the same tion discussed the present radial from the reference vor is outside of the defined then the kln will default to the beginning of the approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the kln does not take into account the try of the active flight plan when determining the arc intercept this point is defined solely on the present radial and the defined arc distance from the reference for this reason it is better to delay selecting approaches that contain dme arcs until the aircraft is closer to the the cursor over add to pl press the approach will be loaded into the active flight plan just like any other approach would the approach is loaded into the flight plan the kln may give the pts in edit en route pts as this message is given because very often it will be necessary it the active flight plan to ensure that proper point ing examine the flight plan if observe the nav page to make sure that the sequence of points does not have any unnecessary legs in kln will now provide guidance to the arc intercept the nav page displays the entire arc on the the tion that is between the beginning of the arc and the arc intercept is drawn with dashed the part that is between the arc ept point and the end of the arc is drawn with the normal solid line some cases atc may provide radar vectors to the the kln provides means to define new intercept point based on the current track of the aircraft over the this can be done from either the nav page or from the pl the dashed line displayed on the nav page will help you to mine if atc is giving you correct the nav pull out the right inner knob to bring up the point scanning the right inner knob until the first point of the arc is in this for approaches this will have small appended to the point if the recalculation is to be done from the pl then turn on the cursor and move it over the first point of the and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure either page press this will change the point to read if it is desired to recompute the arc intercept point then press if new arc intercept point is not desired then press was then kln will calculate an arc intercept point based on the present track of the aircraft over the the present track does not intercept the then kln will display no tin the scratchpad area of the the aircraft approaches the arc the kln will provide point alerting and turn anticipation to join the established on the arc the kln provides ance relative to the curved

determine your position relative to these points along the the kln will display new value in the bottom right corner of the display on the nav this new bit of tion is denoted by the letters arc followed by three three numbers represent the current radial that you are on relative to the reference the arc radial is forced into this position when the aircraft is nm from the the display is shown in figure just watch this value and when it reads the same as one of the points you can descend as this particular example does not have such but there are quite few approaches that approaches and and

necessary to manually change the active when the and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active point to the when you change from obs to make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active approach very rarely there will be problem with the integrity of the gps tem while you are conducting approaches with the kln in some cases the kln will determine that there will not be sufficient integrity monitoring for the leg between the and the or aim is not currently in these cases the kln will not go into the approach active mode and will present the ing not apr mode inhibited predict aim on th these cases you will not be able to finish the approach there is insufficient integrity the th page provides means for you to predict when aim will be to perform aim prediction on the th page two pieces of ation are the first is the location that the prediction will be for and the second is the time for the destination point by be the missed point of an approach loaded in the flight if there is no approach in the flight then the default point is the last point in the active flight of course it is possible for you to enter any point in this time used for the aim prediction will be the current eta to the destination airport or the this time is automatically updated by the kln so there is usually no need to enter if you are making aim calculation for planning it is also possible to enter time in this an important point about this time is that the time used for aim prediction is always in the future and limited to hours from the present for if the time is now and the time entered for the eta is then the prediction will be made for the next day not one hour approaches and and to perform manual aim the left outer and inner knobs to select the th the cursor will be over the aim the desired point identifier by using the inner and outer knobs just like you do for any other point

instrument and stars terminal arrival by procedures stored in the data base can only be considered accurate as long as the data base is even though the data base contains sid and star there is lot of information that is not included in the data the paper chart is still the primary source of for many procedures require the aircraft to fly to certain along heading until intercepting and many other procedures that the kln can not automatically many procedures require pilot action to ensure that the proper path is flown over the the main purpose of loading sid or star into the active flight plan is to provide you with quick way of loading potentially large number of and star procedures can be as challenging to fly as some approaches therefore it is mandatory that you are comfortable with the operation of the kln before attempting to fly sid and star in flight plan operation and the obs mode should be second nature to are some procedures in the world that not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base and therefore the points that make up these procedures would have to be entered it is good preflight practice ensure that the kln tains anticipated procedures for the and star procedures are stored with the airport for which sid and star procedures are accessed through the apt if there are both and stars for given then there will be two apt one to select sid and the other to select this is indicated by it is also possible to have only sid or only star in which case there is only one apt approaches and and sid and star procedures are defined in three the parts are the sid or star name transition and runway specific component rw the apt pages lead you through the selection selecting sid use the following procedure to select some steps may not be necessary depending on the procedure that you wish to for this the porte nine departure from san francisco international will be select on one of the airport

how to select this star is to the worth international airport select dfw on one of the airport pages if you are operating from an active flight plan you can use the act page for dfw by scanning

of the more difficult that you are likely to come most procedures are not this but this sid serves as good example for what steps to take when you encounter difficult fly this procedure use the following steps and refer to the chart this sid the sid as described in section procedure states and proceed via sfo the dme fix at or above to accomplish this of the put the kln into the obs mode with as the active point and make selected it easiest to accomplish these steps before is the point that is dme from the sfo ac and bound course to this after climb to as required by the the aircraft reaches turn left to heading of this point it is necessary to manually change the active point to this is done easily from either the nav or from the pl in either once porte is highlighted by the press to bring up the direct to confirm porte as the direct to the selected course on the hsi or cdi to the new value of as required by the continue flying heading of the hsi or cdi needle centers and then fly to keep the needle centered and fly to and and kln approaches and and reaching change back to the leg mode to enable automatic point once the aircraft reaches porte the kln will automatically sequence to the next passing the procedure calls for intercepting the to wages to do this with the kln change back to the obs mode and make sure that wages is the active set the selected course to reaching wages change to the leg this will allow automatic point sequencing upon reaching is an altitude restriction marked with an on the the name of this point is means that the point is nm from the make sure to meet any tude requirements upon reaching this the aircraft reaches proceed on with the rest of the flight plan as example of star procedure to illustrate the use of the kln with star procedures the required to fly acton four arrival to worth international will be shown in this this procedure is considerably simpler than the sid example shown in section for this example assume that the aircraft departs from el texas and files for the acton four arrival with the wink use the lowing steps to fly this procedure with the kln and refer to the chart for this star the star into the flight plan as described in section star is very simple and the kln will automatically guide the aircraft along the proper route until the qn before reaching qn examine this procedure and notice that there are two different routes depending on what type of craft is flying the turbojets fly to creek intersection while fly to the data base in the kln has the sequence of points for the turbojet procedure not the sequence for is extremely rare to have different path over the ground turbojets and but be sure to cross check with your paper and and if the aircraft you are flying in is then fly the rest of the star as depicted on the chart with no changes to the flight if the aircraft is not turbojet then follow these to the pl page and delete the following and to do this turn on the cursor

was originally conceived and implemented by the united states department of defense the system able to all civilian users free of gps provides extremely precise and time satellites are not as is the case with weather and television that each satellite is not above fixed spot on the earth all the but rather is continuously moving across the in each satellite completely orbits the earth two times per department of defense imposes an intentional accuracy of the gps this degradation is known as selective availability when sa is only military users have access to full gps for civilian position accuracy is degraded to no worse than at the time of this selective availability is on therefore accuracy is ly of the position determining the technique used to determine position is fundamentally very the complicated part is accounting for and correcting all the possible errors in the gps receiver is able to determine the time it takes radio to travel from the satellite to the gps since this radio signal travels at the speed of light statute miles per the time delay can very easily be used to determine the distance from given if measurements are taken from four satellites three satellites and an input from an aircraft the receiver can identify its position very appendix appendix for the gps receiver might determine that it is miles from satellite miles from satellite and miles from satellite at the same the aircraft altimeter might be indicating an altitude of feet there is only one point in space that satisfies these four data signals two of the primary types of signals that the gps satellites broadcast are almanac and ephemeris these signals enable the gps receiver to quickly lock on to the satellites in the receiver would have to look for each of the satellites to determine which ones could be data is very crude data which describes the orbital position of the each of the satellites transmits the almanac data for all so gps receiver has only to listen to one satellite in order to know which satellites are the at that particular almanac data is good for about six so when you turn the receiver then back on month it will know what satellites to look data is very precise data which each satellite transmits tell the gps receiver exactly where it is and what its orbital will be for about the next four each satellite transmits its own unique ephemeris appendix not to gps system the gps system is composed of three the the control and the user space segment consists of the star satellites which orbit the earth at an altitude of nautical the satellite orbits are very precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the gps system hours every there are almost always more than six satellites in view from anywhere on control segment consists of network of and control the master control station is located in colorado all satellite data which is collected by the other ground stations is assimilated and analyzed at colorado based on these ephemeris updates as tem clock are sent to the satellites through radio transmitters at the ground these ground stations are located at kwajalein of hawaii in the central pacific diego garcia the indian and ascension the south atlantic an owner of gps you can now claim to be member of the gps user gps has many users and and more are being dreamed up all the not only are aircraft using gps so are military systems and and personal automobiles and transport trucks use intelligent transportation or to find their and track their some biologists attach gps receivers to animals to monitor their movement and migration geologists even use gps to track the movement of ers and to analyze plate tectonics of the an exciting new technology as we move into the autonomous integrity monitoring is function that every gps receiver must continuously perform to assure an accurate one characteristic of the gps space and control segments is that they instantly fix satellite if it sending misleading positioning for this gps receiver rely on the gps satellites to tell it when there is the words indicate that the gps kln appendix appendix on can detect an inaccuracy in the gps it does this by using distance measurements from as many satellites as possible to check the consistency of the position is called an position there are not enough satellites in view to assure the position the kln notifies the five measurements with good geometry positions of the are needed to provide this means that at least five satellites or four satellites and pressure altitude input from the altimeter are required assure aim if this check shows some sistency in the the kln notifies the user that other navigation sources should be used to the sometimes the receiver is unable to assure the position to enough accuracy for the phase of due to the location of the satellites at that availability is very seldom difficulty when in the en route terminal phases of the allowable limits are much tighter when approach is performed with kln for this the kln other page allows the pilot to enter time and and the gps receiver will predict if aim will be available to shoot the see section for more information about the aim prediction receiver the kln and kln use an honeywell gps receiver known as the gps it was dubbed this way because it is cal in size to an everyday credit and its faster

overview of how the project research and analysis were and list of the significant findings and readers and front line managers who may need or want more details of the research and and complete listing of findings and recommendations can refer to the full report that the noncompliance problem approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for aviation accounting annually for approximately percent of all flight safety foundation study of years of runway excursions determined that percent could have been avoided with decision to go in other percent of all accidents could potentially be prevented by going it is generally felt that an unstable approach is the primary cause of landing within this just over half of the landing excur followed fully stable in these the flight became unstable only during critical industry policy designed to help prevent such accidents is the and the collective industry performance of complying with policies is extremely poor approximately percent of unstable approaches result in policy why is critical policy designed to prevent the most common type of accident ignored by flight and why is that policy not being managed effectively by improving the compliance rate holds tremendous potential in re approach and landing accidents the itself is not without there is an increased risk in loss of control events during compared to exposure with all other phases of it follows that we should only go around when the risk associated with an unstable approach is greater than the risk associated with what is that and how do we minimize exposure to only those that are really the flight safety foun making and execution project was launched to research and answer the question are we so poor at complying with established it was also intended to improve our understanding of the risks associated with executing and to make com to improve compliance and mitigate risks with the maneuver the full report includes complete find strategies and recommendations for industry corrective and future work as it is meant as source for the development of operator refer products such as guidelines and research and analysis many alas have been investigated thoroughly over and much is known about contributing what is is an understanding of the psychology of pli research and analysis of decision making have been conducted primarily from the psychosocial science perspective to gain an understanding of the psychological drivers of and to identify corrective steps that can be based on this is the first industry of its type for this specific the presage group conducted the research and based on its situational model of nine distinct or from two global studies via one survey analyzed the psychology of noncompliance by flight and the other examined the psychology of actions in handling company detailed analysis can be found in the full for the execution an accident and incident review was conducted that included selection of published accident and serious incident re about events involving transport category aircraft between and total of events were in the safety of the was central to the accident or incident in th the aftermath of the was the main purpose of the the events involved jets twin turboprops and jets the safety aspects and overall level of risk of each event were analyzed and characterized by review each event was assigned to one of three categories according to the degree of risk presented by the high risk moderate risk and in the two six safety issues were identified with respect to the ia and conduct of each most of the bearing events were associated with single but five events were associated with two each event also was assigned one of three loss of controlled flight into terrain or midair significant findings an effective policy has three main it is well thought out and clearly written to balance the needs of safety and company management handles the policy and company front line aware is such that the policy is carried out research revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the operator and employee significant findings the collective industry norm is to accept the pli of despite empirical data that indicate this is the most common contributor to the industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable approaches as the sole means to reduce even though empirical data show that unstable approaches affect less than half of runway overall awareness of ala risks and of the impact those risks have on approach and landing safety is management is generally disengaged from noncompliance and has low awareness of the impact it has on perception of risk is pilots do not see current policy criteria as realistic for the operational effective decision making in flight deck com cation is although considered normal flight eu are as reported by flight one in has potentially hazardous such as an aircraft for there are variable techniques and depending on the point during the approach when the around procedures and training do not adequately address many of these pilot experience in the aircraft type affects including complex controller radio can affect recommendations it is evident that the state of noncompliance has been steady for many years and will remain steady unless changes are first and the industry must improve its awareness of the shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is the cultural shift will be easier if the industry shifts as opposed to individual attacking the issue on their as several are already as stated three key attributes of an effective policy the policy makes operational sense to both the employees who execute it and those who manage the policy is managed effectively to level that satisfies company and the employees who should follow the policy are very aware of that policy and the environment in which it is as the following recommendations touch upon these key more detailed recommendations can be found in the full strategic recommendations for decision making include the ensure the policy makes sense update the stable approach definition and stable ap height to maximize their relevance among flight and their manageability among separate the stable approach definition and criteria from criteria to improve aware that these are two distinct aspects of and that decision making is viable beyond the defined approach this separation does not imply that these two distinct areas cannot meet at points throughout the approach and it is intended for developers of standard operating pro dures and communication procedures to break the psychological attachment of these two manage the policy operators set specific compliance rate targets performance and establish initiatives to achieve amend industry and regulatory audit programs to include standards and recommended practices that address noncompliance increase situational increase awareness of and risks associated with continuing to land when and the significant impact that noncompliance has on alas operator flight industry and pilot enhance situational awareness aware to heighten flight awareness throughout the approach and landing policy and procedural communication minimizing the subjectivity of decision making for the decision maker the pilot flying or to mitigate those components of situ awareness that compromise the risk assessment and each recommendation helps improve the psychological riv that affect good decision and it is this ec that the recommendations were specifically designed to although all strategic recommendations are important and should be implemented as part of holistic few are worth if an operator has the means to install automated stable approach and land alerting it should be these systems address many of the psychological issues associated with noncompliance and could be the single most effective way to improve management must be more involved in managing the an area where management has been very much key steps to be taken by management are to set compliance rate targets consistent with safety management system prin and to investigate and follow up on each approach that continues to an unstable flight crew situational awareness needs to be improved primarily through better communication throughout the approach and which can be achieved largely through active communication techniques as part of standard strategic execution ensure that training and awareness pri reflect different execution risk review procedures and men to maximize their clarity and ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitoring during landing and as with any significant program and effects should be closely monitored by pri audit programs such as flight data analysis line operations safety audits or international air trans association operational safety audits action taken in light of the findings and it is appar that revisions are required to flight safety elements of stabilized and safe landing guidelines analysis indicates there are facets of that guidance that are not optimal for effective decision making and that may encourage for approaches that may be of very low when this report was being the analysis for such revisions had already taken but the project review committee recommended an operational trial before changes in the guidelines are formally appendices and for flight safety foun stabilized approach and for industry and safe landing for industry project conclusion the problem of policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the greatest threat to flight safety and the po impact of improvement in compliance is no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go the industry must improve its awareness of the to accomplish shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is attain the cultural shift will be much easier if the in shifts as opposed to individual companies taking individual several companies already have chosen to go it alone on this the project accomplished the goals of the document that outlined the terms of flight safety safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight and to consider the safety risk with and ensure that the transfer of risk is there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of the not all envisioned products have been and this is noted in the report as work yet to be done by flight safety background presentation in flight safety international advisory committee was briefed about concerns that often were not being conducted when an unstable approach occurred below the stable approach height the ensuing discussion concluded in agreement that the issue should be studied the eu advisory committee began its own discussion related to the lack of unstable approach policy the risk of the maneuver and what effect air traffic services providers could have on the these discussions led the foundation to look more deeply into the empirical data supporting such failure to conduct is the number one risk factor in approach and landing accidents and the number one cause of runway excursions the year in recent analyses of data from through indicate that percent of all accidents are runway and that they are the most common type of accident the year in unstable approaches occur on to percent of all and to percent of flight crews whose airplanes are in this state continue the approach to landing the year in evidence based in of approach and landing accidents and serious one of several studies conducted by flight safety approach and landing accident reduction task force and published by the foundation in the task force con an analysis of accidents and incidents that occurred from through the task force found that was initiated in only percent of the occurrences and said that the evidence analysts expected the initiation of higher number of in safety foundation alar task approximately percent of all accidents are alas one analysis concluded that more than percent of alas would have been preventable if the crew had decided to go around the year in simply potentially about half of all accidents could be prevented with decision to go no other single de can have such an impact on the overall aviation accident although all of these studies are somewhat the consistencies from study to study indicate the problem is real and is of the magnitude the studies around decision can yield great but what about the risks associated with the maneuver there is no shortage of informative studies that have ana what occurred during alas and what factors contrib to the no known study has examined flight crew decision making from psychological perspective to determine why some crews continued with an unstable knowingly violating company and why th elected to go what are the drivers of intentional noncompliance with critical safety the alar task analysis of approach and landing accidents and serious incidents identified professional decision as the most re casual occurring in percent of the another form of poor decision making or continuing an approach when conditions suggest otherwise accounted for percent of all occurrences safety foundation alar task more questions arise about the or of company management in these if the data have been consistent for many why have managers not been able to correct the with such low industry compliance some basic questions about role need to be are they aware of the noncompliance and if then why have they been unable to mitigate or improve compliance with established if they are not concerned with the poor compliance why man issues were not cited in any of the conclusions of the alar task final of fatal approach and landing in the task conclusions of related study of approach and landing ac and serious management fail was identified as circumstantial factor in percent of the occurrences safety foundation alar task based on these better awareness of the and new flight safety foundation initiated the and execution project it was designed as joint with each committee focusing on one specific aspect of the the focused on decision and the focused on the performance of the decision making flight crew methodology and information collection the presage group was commissioned by flight safety foun to conduct research and analysis on the psychology of factors contributing to intentional the basis for much of the following comes from two studies conducted by presage one that analyzed the psychology of flight crew decision making during unstable and another that analyzed the psychology of company management decision making pertaining to addressing noncompliance with com safety policies jamieson and why are policies the ology of de making during unstable jamieson and why are policies the view from the airline although the issue extends beyond unstable the studies were conducted on this phase of flight as data were readily attainable from flight psychological survey was developed that used unique questioning and experimental methodologies to understand the causation of compliant versus noncompliant flight crew decision these techniques included assess experiences using series of questions designed to explore the psychological precursors of risk assessment and decision second survey was designed to assess the beliefs and experiences of airline ag and safety and operational personnel regarding unstable approaches and how they are managed at their host to fully understand the systemic roots and dynamics of noncompliance with unstable approach policies across the the results of the managers study were compared with those of the parallel flight crew flight crew event recall study segmentation in this segment of the we asked pilots to recall recent specific instances of unstable at or below sah we asked for the last instance they had this special task elicited detailed descriptions of their experiences during the minutes leading up to and including decision on whether to call for these experiences include subjective aspects their situational and risk felt social beliefs about their as well as their psychological representations of the objective factors characterizing the aircraft and the environment during their approaches flight visual reference ndi environmental and air traffic control these variables constitute full and recounting of the objective factors and their resulting psychological states during the critical time interval leading up to the decisions states that were hypothesized to be the highly important precursors of those in to help refine the pilots also reported variety of basic demographic information time on base of and flight operational characteristics haul versus short haul aircraft the content of the entire survey was thoroughly commented upon and amended in accordance with the recommendations made by members of the and and other expert advisory team the pilots were divided into those who only experienced continuing to land with an unstable approach those who only experienced those who had experienced both and unstable approach pilots in this group were randomly as to one of two groups to recall scenario in which they had flown an unstable approach but did not call for or to recall this random experimental assignment allowed us to identify objective and psychological situational factors associated with noncompliance with policies re decision pilots who reported they had only flown or an unstable approach recently in the last five recalled their last

foundation associated with more operationally compliant decision pilot thresholds study segmentation second experiment was included in this and we report some findings but the details are too mer to fully describe this experiment was designed to uncover the environmental and physical instability param that influence perceptions of the risks inherent in flying unstable and to examine when their attention to these parameters affects their judgments about when to call for in this pilots were pre with hypothetical flight scenario in which they were randomly assigned to receive variations in the severity of the risk associated with wind runway braking action and runway they were then asked at what degree of on five different flight those variations would cause them to call for pilots were instructed to report on their likelihood of calling for based on their own personal risk not those of their companies or of the on this set of five flight and to do so at different this allowed us to infer where on the flight path different risk factors become personally salient and important as drivers of judgments to go and how these factors might the objective was to determine whether there was basic alignment between about when there is need to call for and general policies about when these instabilities necessitate such in case of evidence of any gaps between these our goal was to use these data to guide realistic recommendations about changes in policy that might bring them into alignment while ensuring that safety would not be to the extent that pilots do not see current policies as constituting set of legitimately unsafe they are likely to ignore such standard procedures and engage in potentially pli flight this was an experimentally based attempt to explore pilot perceptions of what should constitute the conditions to go in their experienced and to begin to develop view about whether such beliefs could be or should be incorporated into policy guidance and sops in way that would help ensure safe pilot respondent sampling respondents to this survey were solicited through direct communication with safety personnel at various pilot and and airlines as well as through various social media the goal was to invite and administer the online survey to as many pilots as possible from around the representing variety of flight respondent experience physical and so anonym

asked safety managers at major airlines those with the authority to recommend or enact changes in unstable approach criteria and as well as those responsible for quality control of flight op series of questions regarding their views of the safety procedures and organizational cultures with which unstable approaches and occur in their own airline we asked such managers about the rates of compliance with unstable approach policies that they believed their airlines as well as the compliance rates experienced by the commercial industry as beyond this basic we asked whether they were satisfied with their performance on li with their unstable policies and and whether they thought them about their perceptions of the clarity and appropriateness of these policies and about their beliefs that they had the support support and organizational to manage their and about their overall assessment of how urgently they believed that the risks perceived in their rates needed to be addressed at the content of the entire survey was thoroughly commented upon and amended in ac with the recommendations made by members of the the and other expert advisory team as in the pilot the main set of

outreach and engagement strategy for the survey garnered unique visits to the survey we consider this number of hits to be very indicating that the engagement strategy drove meaningful number of airline managers to the of those only completed the response rate low in both absolute and relative to the rate of participation among pilots who were asked to complete much longer and more demanding this low response rate we the first evidence pointing toward disengagement with the topic of unstable policy and procedures among airline flight operations personnel at the managerial this is especially true when we consider that the original criterion for inclusion in our final analysis stipulated that respondents must be in position to develop and influence unstable policies and procedures at their airlines by virtue of their authority to recommend or make based on this inclusion criterion and an analysis of reported roles and we achieved sample of only qualified spon to increase the sample size for we widened the sample frame to include those respondents responsible for quality control of flight operations at their even if they did not have policy development thorough comparison of the latter group with the original target revealed no systematic differences in their survey justifying their inclusion in the final the reports the results from managers per of all survey respondents and percent of survey site this low response rate essen disallowed us from analyzing data for experimental task of determining personal around thresholds for unstable approach risk among similar to the threshold in light of the low response caveat must be issued for all other results that we report that is because the normative response to the survey invitation among managers worldwide was to choose not to we must question whether this was valid and reliable sample of that the although based on this small are highly suggestive of trends in perspectives on unstable policies and while we are unsure if the sample in our intuition tells us that any sample if would tend toward having surveyed managers who are more aware and concerned about the issue than those who are less if this is these results may more likely the degree of awareness and concern about unstable around noncompliance that exists in the industry sensing throughout the there have been numerous

these groups are and represent situationally important factors associated with decision not pilot dispositional pilot tendencies and preferences associated with flying unstable approaches of present in the aviation and we will also point out in the data how such pilot sposi factors may additionally contribute to noncompliance with it is our belief that the best way to present the findings is to describe how noncompliant behavior is function of process influenced by the aircraft and environmental factors that shape their situational awareness competencies in encoding and inter the cues they receive about these aircraft and their personal perceptions of risk and risk tolerance that and their appetite for appropriate col conversation about risk during the approach as an input to decision it is from both the responses within each of these four classes of as well as the interactions between the two that complete scrip psychological profile for noncompliance pilot situational awareness profile situational awareness of his or her in all its is the psychological prerequisite for pilot to judge risk and then to make decision to maintain compliance and safety in light of that this study used the situational awareness model for measuring and interpreting the psychological and social factors that col make up situational recall that within this situational awareness comprises nine distinct but interconnected and seamless aspects of much of our discussion will be framed around how each of these aspects influences singly and in concert with one to remain compliant rather than note in passing that the presage model classifies with an average percent accuracy whether pilots are describing an unstable approach and landing or percent for unstable approaches and percent for based only on its psychosocial measurements and excluding any knowledge of the objective factors present in the unstable approach scenarios this means that our assessment of the experience of aware as we have measured does good job of predicting behavior far beyond percent chance level of the results of this study as that on all nine situational awareness unstable approach pilots were significantly less aware than pilots in the moments leading up to and including their around decision making that they were less aware of their emotional responses to less able to anticipate more overconfident in their ability to compensate for the and in less agreement with company in other the unstable pilots scored much lower than did the pilots on every facet of situational awareness seven of these nine differ held up statistically to the more rigorous analysis that compared just the experimentally assigned and un approach pilots with one and eight of the nine differences between the experimentally assigned and unstable approach pilots were even more pronounced when comparing the and it is meaningful to does this awareness shape perception of put situational awareness competencies directly affect his or her perceptions and assessment of the lower the degree of threat that pilots associate with instability and environmental factors the perception of which is directly informed by their situ awareness the lower the significance that pilots will place on the contributing factors and the less risky they will perceive the situation to table shows this with unstable pilots reporting much lower assess of the riskiness and unmanageability of their bili than the spreading activation effect of situational awareness competencies we have asserted that the nature of the facets of situational awareness means that decline in one facet will produce rapid deleterious effect on the this becomes clear when we consider the data relevant to this activation of situational awareness for this effect is evident among the unstable approach pilot whose lower scores on their gut feel for threats as well as on actually seeing the leave them vulnerable to minimizing both their assessment of the potential threat of aircraft instability and their ability to see the threat of instability as risk to be managed the natural outcome is that more unstable approach pilots are unstable at sah corollary of these lower aware scores is that unstable approach pilots also score lower in their ability to leverage crew relationships to maximize compliance and table shows that unstable approach pilots are more likely to minimize efforts to consider discuss with their members both instability factors path aircraft ref sink rate and land and environmental factors contaminated runway and occupied it is the culminating effect of the aforementioned reduced awareness competencies that leaves the unstable approach pilots vulnerable to adopting mental model that minimizes the risk of instability and reduces their attention to as the results for the instruments and and the indicate functional and hierarchical in table unstable approach pilots are more tolerant of deviations from operational limits and procedures and less compliant with requirements that they perform all checklists and standard as these pilots commit to continuing with an unstable they minimize what their professional experience could offer in executing what the sop states table note on or critical in other when an unstable approach pilot is not tuned into salient from his or her experience he increases the risk profile of the operation and denies himself the opportunity to correctly adjust or compensate for the operational threat table to or compensatory the finding that unstable approach pilots more often than pilots report being unstable at sah confirms this missed opportunity to remain compliant in concert with the former pattern is the finding that unstable approach pilots were more comfortable operating on the margins of the safety envelope in table note the lower scores on the or empirical which translates to greater tolerance for risk that is seen to be in table note the assessment of the instability as if pilot is paying less attention to his situational awareness he would likely also shut himself off from avail such as by using interpersonal relationships to protect operational safety and remain compliant table note each other or relational there are number of significant findings at the level of this construct that tell meaningful most notable among these is that unstable approach pilots are relatively more likely than pilots to feel crew to to perceive lack of crew support for possible to feel discomfort in being challenged and in challenging and to feel inhibited about calling for because of the authority structure in the pilots are about four times more likely than unstable approach pilots percent to report recalling that an individual was prompting the crew to initiate ref is reference landing speed the evidence is clear that rather than leveraging the crew relationships as tool for safe decision crew expectations and communication had even compounding this risk profile are the findings that unstable approach pilots score lower on support for and that fewer than percent of unstable pilots believed they would be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to land at the same maintaining that their criteria for when to execute are not realistic in the for the unstable approach there is less to company and an incentive structure that or is at least not seen to unstable approaches that are continued to these results describe situation that creates internal conflict for the unstable approach at least in when they express regret for their decision to continue an unstable approach to landing compared with unstable approach pilots rated their flight outcomes less believed less often that they had made the right believed much more strongly than pilots that they should not have made the decisions they did agreed more strongly that they had engaged in needless interpretation of results the results appear to imply conflicting message from the unstable approach pilot on one unstable ap pilots regret their decisions to continue an unstable approach and knowing that they have taken and at the same they believe that the criteria for are realistic the latter may in rationalization of their noncompliant and one that they carry forward into the next such unstable approach at the moment of the potential for noncompliant behavior based on these beliefs is very while the chance seems remote that pilots may anticipate regret for not calling for and may have that anticipation inhibit their tendency to continue the unstable consider the psychosocial factors affecting unstable ap pilots at the time they need to make an appropriate decision on whether to go they have lowered sense of situational awareness across most which has led them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their assessment of their process re little help from protective crew norms and and there is no real disincentive to fly unstable the expected company response to that these are the ingredients of recipe for the of to contaminate this component of aviation safety this term refers to the development of mode of which is passively support tolerated approved by its owners and in some regula once entrenched within given this new power and authority can considerably influence as evidenced in the challenger and columbia space shuttle tragedies supportive evidence from the results of this study indicates that in their acceptance of the noncom unstable approach pilots have surrendered level of situational awareness competency that directly impacts accurate risk assessment and full compliance with sops as in new roles and incentives have come to displace some of the influence that situational awareness should have in proximity to risk assessment and decision pilot thresholds for going around another area for discussion is the second experimental part of the which asked pilots to describe their risk toler

what he or she perceives as safe and manageable level of this determination flows directly from his level and type of situational awareness and the mental models of risk he constructs based on that to the extent that pilot has lowered situational awareness whether caused by acute aspects of the situation such as high workload or chronic aspects of the cultural environment such as lessened acceptance of the policy guidance or generally few challenges to cockpit command he will be less sensitive to relevant situational awareness cues and therefore be more likely to continue an unstable

that are expected to trigger single set of criteria is often insufficient to cover all as tony an psychologist and author of several books on human has guidance is ef when it is thought out and written explained commonly understood and voluntarily complied too many rules lead to cynicism and because not all situations can be rules cannot be developed to cover all possible in these the human ability to adapt to changing situations is just as important as the implementation of effective policies and need to reach point where two types of professional discipline become kern first is the organizational discipline to keep the rules to an absolute minimum and enforce the rules across the the second is the personal discipline to comply company too he policies and procedures conflict with cultural and when that who studies noncompliance knows that culture will nearly always trump at least in the long not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent and based on the different objective environments from approach to there can be conflict between these and the singular prescriptive company as in by the disagreement with company policy once pilot is outside the prescriptive box of policy and has made the decision to continue the he is left to his individual risk assessment whatever that may to determine his personal risk thresh without robust prescriptive policies that allow for some open analysis of risk and decision making can offer solution to these cases in which the objective and stated policies do not align for if policy says that flight crew must go around in all cases if the aircraft has not touched down within seven seconds of crossing the the pilots likely would view the importance of that policy dif depending on the conditions of the they would likely be more in agreement with the policy for an approach to shorter runway that was contaminated and had slight tail wind than for an approach to dry runway with slight head if the policy is written to allow some from the under some guiding pilots will agree with the policy more in this example of the short contaminated the briefing should include statement that there would be no modification of the whereas in the case of the long the briefing may include an allowance to increase that frame to it is important to em that these allowances should follow guided process laid out by the and that the policies remain mi in this guiding principles may be that all members agree in advance of the and that the landing distance available exceeds the landing distance required by predetermined allowing some guided decision pilots will be more likely to trust and voluntarily comply with written in part because those policies will address the highly variable environments in which pilots work and also because the pilots will recognize that their expertise and knowledge are being used in the an increased agree on policy leads to increased and to the normalization of stable approach and decision points it is also worth discussing the relationship between the stable approach the sah safe landing guidelines and decision as the decision to go around remains possible up until the point of deploy and policies usually indicate that should be initiated any time an aircraft becomes unstable below the then it follows that the decision point to go around defines the beginning of zone in which is mandatory if the approach is thrust reverser deployment defines the end of that most sop channel flight crews to specific decision points to determine if they are in state in which it is safe to continue the these points are before deploy these sop callout points are usually linked with leaving no formal stable for an extended period of time when is active calls selection of calls that are mandatory for all varying objective force communication between or conditional on the other are only communicated if stimulated by the weakness in the passive call process is if call is not it could be for reasons other than the required objective condition being for if member did not see the call would not be in member might choose not to make call for varying such as subjective interpretation of the condition or fear of the cockpit authority active calls are always as they force their absence indicates another such as pilot many responsive by the pilot flying at sah or minimum approach height suggest what will what they are going to do for example suggestive calls like to influence the decision to land and close the window for the decision to go even though may be required if the flight becomes unstable very late in the approach or repeated and escalated calls allow condition to remain alive in the conscious mind of the on the other single callout for example at sah raises situational awareness about the condition at that as situational awareness is it can change improving or and that are designed to continue as long as the condition exists help to maintain awareness of that escalation of the calls can heighten take the example of from enhanced ground proximity warning systems and other terrain awareness and warning systems the system alerts the flight crew to pending condition and continues with until the condition is no longer the same effect can be com in unstable approach by both members and automated as the onset of approach instabilities can occur at any even late in the landing phase keys to safe the window for decision that the deci is not made at defined point at the the decision points for are separate and distinct from the stable approach and as procedure designers can separate the two to maximize decision in reviewing the fsf alar task force elements of stabilized safety foundation alar task we discover somewhat conflicting mes it states that approaches in instrument meteorological conditions must be stabilized before reaching ft visual meteorological conditions they must be stabilized before ft agl in precision and visual approaches on the other the document indicates that descent below ft is acceptable in maneuver for circling and specifies that should be level on final when the aircraft reaches ft above airport in other on precision guided the documented guidance is that the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl in and on circling guided the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet it is not difficult for pilot to conclude if it is acceptable and safe to fly off final approach profile until ft agl on then it is also safe to fly an approach to ft off although that by objective objective is that which does not require an individual to interpret information based on his or her ex or it is usually factual objective feedback in the cockpit minimizes the need for interpretation and can lead to more consistent and faster decision stating fact instead of interpreting making judgment or forming an opinion helps mini the effect of steep authority gradient in the such as may exist when first officer is paired with an example of objective feedback is that by an automated system such as in this there is little subjective analysis done by the pilot when re to automated and the response can be quick and this in why an automated energy approach monitoring and alerting can be very effective in improving another example of the use of objective feedback is the use of radio altimeter automatic rather than interpreting radio altimeter readout readouts can fluctuate due to terrain and must be observed and on the other are only in the absence of an automated energy management after pilots cross the they usually subjectively or how much runway has passed or how much from they decide whether to conduct if the pilot monitoring times the threshold crossing and then makes procedural call at the point where touchdown should occur or should this call constitutes objective feedback to the pilot flying and makes clear that some either touchdown or should occur should have driven by policy and minimizing subjectivity in pro is an objective that procedural designers should make every effort to management decision making overview of results in table we present data for of their awareness if their specific estimates both the and their own rates of compliance with unstable when asked whether they knew what the compliance rate only percent of managers said that they of those who claimed fewer were willing to estimate managers percent of the offered an estimated which averaged percent compliance times the true and was highly variable percent to standard only one in seven managers reported rate that was considered percent of the actual percent the perception of rates may not be the central concern of managers working to police their own noncompliance with unstable but this general lack of awareness and accuracy in estimating the true even among those claiming cannot be when asked whether they knew what their own compliance rate percent of managers said that they although only percent offered an estimate of that majority of managers are largely unaware of unstable compliance and noncompliance even within their own of the managers who offered the mean rate was percent again with large range to and standard de these managers are estimating li rates at their companies that on more than percent above the industry average as they perceive it if their estimates were they would indicate that the companies were outperforming the indus as whole by more than tenfold percent what is most striking is the tremendous degree of variability in the revealing that there is very little common basis of even among those claiming knowledge of the rates at their own in our it is highly unlikely that this is an objective for perceptions to have truly tracked with these data would mean that companies are ex the full range of compliance from zero to it is hard to imagine that this is the and hard to imagine how this could result in an average that hovers at percent year after table manager of awareness and levels of policy compliance perceived rates of compliance with policy for the industry for their

these managers are not the same who reported on their flight operations compliance rates in answer to the prior one in eight managers reported compliance rates broadly in line with the industry average less than at the opposite end of the percent re rates above the mean rate was again with wide range and variability to with standard deviation of that such spread of compliance rates is reported by this sample is we believe it reflects not only general lack of awareness among managers of the rates of compliance with their own policies strongly indicated by the incidence of but perhaps also specific errors within their although objective data are this assertion can only be by again assuming that compliance rates exceeding percent are rare in the we cannot rule this out because although we have access to we lack objective verification of company compliance if the rates are it suggests that our sample is drawn from an unusually compliant subsample of in that the lack of awareness effects across the manager study suggests that awareness could be less than we begin with some overall observations about the data in table on each of the three the norma response is to not and only minority of ag claim to or rate of as managers and compliance rates for their own companies more frequently than they do for the industry as probably because they are less familiar with their perception of the compliance is out of line with six times greater than the actual percent rate of managers tell us as an aggregate sample that they believe their companies are outperforming the rate of compliance by to on this is the equivalent of compliance rate at least times greater than the as if we assume that these com have more realistic unstable policy compliance rate below percent rate span still up to three times better than the current industry this would mean that only about one in seven managers to in the survey reported an accurate rate for their own whether their reporting was based on personal estimate or on their fda if we give them more and allow that their companies actually achieved rates upward of then high accuracy of rates of report is still shared by fewer than of the seven in simply do not know their own or if they do they their compliance rates by more than these kinds of perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence and complacency about unstable policy manager situational awareness profile manager perceptual measures of situational awareness managers completed questions to assess their beliefs and behaviors concerning their rates and unstable the results are in table the responses were subjected to an empirical factor analysis to determine how they merged in minds and to provide simpler summary categories for presentation and three of the four factors to emerge had more than one associated one factor was assessment of whether the respondent debriefed flight crew who had violated the com unstable factor theme was the perceived support that the spon received from their companies in understanding and managing the six questions this factor com were averaged and called factor comprised questions assessing the degree to which managers thought that their unstable policies and procedures and their associated operational definitions were clear and responses to five questions were averaged to create an index of factor was an expression of ag concerns about and sense of urgency surrounding their it was formulated by averaging responses to the five questions shown in table and named in

that the statement was phrased as as opposed to company may account for the to examine the relationships between positive perceptions of organizational compliance fac and low concern with their we studied responses from only those managers who had reported on their compliance rates that of all those claiming knowledge of this we divided them into managers whose reports were generally close to

scores on the perceived threat index and four of its five component while this pattern may seem obvious in it makes the point independent of the level of support perceived for ag rates were no differences on the perceived support the perception of the policies as effective and the threat as low may flow from basic lack of realistic knowledge or appraisal of the compliance if this causal effect is true that posi perceptions lead to low perceived threat then what is clearly indicated by these data is the need for raising about the industry norm of massive and dissemination of the own data identifying their internal rates of unstable around policy compliance and segmentation analysis to determine whether the sample included types of ag whose views of their compliance rate and performance were consistent with each other and also different from other identified we conducted traditional cluster analysis on this sample of managers agglomerative cluster based on euclidean due to the small sample we generated just two groups to and based the mathematics of this segmentation on variety of responses given in the this of consisted of the perception questions and the two overall measures of effectiveness and satisfaction all the measures presented in table not the resulting groups consisted of one whose members perceived high risk in their compliance rates risk and second group whose members had more moderate view risk the percent of ag who perceived high risk differed from the percent of perceivers on almost all measures in the and powerfully in both the statistical sense and the magnitude sense degree of statistical table shows that on of and on all three the high risk perceiver group showed pattern of higher concern and perceived lower satisfaction

their compliance rates were between and percent suspect number and more than four times as likely to say that their fda showed their rate was between zero and percent number more in line with industry norms picture emerges of group whose members are more realistic and appropriately anxious and concerned about their low rates of but who perhaps have little voice or power within the company to change policy or procedures they see as more likely to be or to offer new definition of what should constitute stable approach they see as overly how did these managers score on the presage indices of situational this situation presents clear instance of via of most policies and procedures surrounding unstable performance rates and their manage as our metrics are likely to show low absolute on scale of to with corresponding to high safety the first column of table which displays these scores for the overall shows this to be the in no case does the absolute score on any of our awareness metrics exceed the midscale of safety awareness is low in all of the awareness areas assessed by our we know in this instance that unstable noncompliance is major problem for the our measures of situational awareness are scored higher when this problem is recognized to be in the ap to scoring shown in table all measures are scored such that higher numbers indicate greater degree of realistic threat awareness and as higher situational awareness on our measures is associated with seeing the cur threat to be real anticipatory and the procedural measures used to compensate for it to be ad adjusting to the managers with higher situational awareness see their current procedures as re and the definitions of instability as too narrow scores on knowing the procedures and knowing the their experience high reliance on peri tells them there is and they feel more anxious and eager to take action against this safety threat gut feeling for because new plan is needed in the face of general lack of appreciation of the threat to compliance in their higher awareness is also associated with perception that their companies have little will to and are generally complacent about the sops in place to manage the threat relational and corporate support for as those with higher awareness also feel less support from and higher level of discomfort in approaching senior management to broach the with this understanding of our scoring methods in we examined the scores of the two groups the managers who reported compliance rate based on their fda that was than versus those who the compliance rate percent or we hypoth sized that more accurate awareness of the low rate of compliance would be associated with heightened sense of perceived threat and the felt need to com all aspects of the situational awareness we that managers who were aware of the actual low rate of compliance with unstable around policies at their airlines would receive higher scores on all nine of our metrics than their colleagues who were even if the magnitude of these scores was still low in absolute terms when compared to the scale in table it can be seen that on seven of our nine metrics of situational the hypothesis that the respondents would report greater situational awareness was supported at level of statistical reliability of percent or that if this experiment were repeated we would observe the same differences in of the only on the and each other were the levels of awareness similar for the two albeit at low absolute in those aware of the low compliance rates at their companies scored at or above the midscale on five of our metrics fec anticipatory and if minimum midscale threshold of situational awareness across majority of our measures was enough to trigger some the individuals in this group were close to reaching such trigger how note that this group constituted just percent of of our sample small minority coming to full aware of the table also shows results derived from cluster analysis on the presage metrics for the two groups those perceiving relatively high risk in their unstable around policies and rates percent of and those not generally perceiving such risks will be recalled these groups were designed for all managers in the irrespective of whether they claimed to or ventured to what their company compliance rate actually according to fda or in this all nine awareness factors are statistically reliably with five means above the midscale for the perception these results are more encouraging in terms of the complement of managers perhaps ready to act in this important area of as about of the sample shows signs of having reached threshold of aware that will trigger activity to manage this issue more safely in the near as demonstration of the effect that improved awareness in one area can have on overall situational we compared the situational awareness scores of all managers with the scores of the group whose members were aware of their internal company compliance rates figure shows the incremental benefit that awareness in one area can have across eight of the nine it is relevant to discuss the approach to monitoring unstable approach flight as many flight data monitoring programs are set to report only when more than one stable approach criterion is and in some to report only low level alert until three or more criteria are we see an indication from those responsible for the design of these programs that there is an acknowledged variability in the risk of unstable more there is an indication of on between the level of concern for low risk unstable approaches and the policy guidance for flight crews on those same which is to execute when one or more criteria are from the spec of the flight why should they be concerned about the risk of this level of unstable approaches if management is not concerned enough to want to be told about them or act on situational awareness of managers who knew company compliance rules feel for

additional base score the presage group for flight safety foundation this is consistent with the results of both the pilot and management psychological industry sensing the conversation about reducing the risk of alas often drifts toward how to eliminate unstable even though the discussion begins with focus on rates of compliance with it is clear that there is larger with the existence of unstable despite the fact that the industry has reduced unstable approaches to percent or in an industry with such variable objective one must ask is the lowest attainable unstable approach it makes sense that an industry with almost nonexistent compliance with policies would be concerned about the small number of unstable approaches that if we turn the tables and consider for moment an industry with high rate of policy would there be as much concern about unstable and is the focus on eliminating unstable approaches the right strategy in reducing in flight safety year study of runway conducted in we see that percent of the landing excursions were las as and of percent followed stable approach that became unstable during the landing only percent of the landing excursions followed unstable overruns

making operation has the potential to affect most landing ex those occurring after flights that become unstable during the approach or landing strategy to continue improving the stable approach rate in addition to improving the compliance rate is the most com the point of this discussion is to illustrate that the tendency to focus only on eliminating unstable approaches will not address large portion of and that improving the compliance rate holds the greater in an fsf runway safety initiative determined that gap existed in alar tool kit risk reduction which did not address the landing phase the foundation then developed safe landing guidelines keys to safe which are intended to be used by aircraft operators to enhance existing throughout this and through industry confer and it was apparent that these guidelines were not well known or commonly documented in company these findings were not part of the data collection decision making the following are findings drawn from mp denotes pilot and mm denotes management mp finding the unstable approach pilot gut feeling for threats the of the experience characterized by an sensory experience that triggers further ni analysis is lower than it is for the pilot mp finding the unstable approach pilot ability to see monitor real and potential threats as they change over time and space is lower than that of the pilot mp finding the unstable approach pilot group is more likely than the pilot group to minimize efforts to discuss instability and environmental factors with other and to shut themselves off from available mp finding unstable approach pilots are more tolerant than pilots of deviations from operational limits and mp finding unstable approach pilots are less compliant than pilots with performing all checklist items and ccu rately completing standard mp finding unstable approach pilots minimize what their pro or critical could offer in terms of executing known compared with mp finding unstable approach pilots are more comfortable than pilots with operating on the margins of which translates into greater tolerance of mp finding unstable approach pilots are more likely than pilots to feel pressure to land or perceive lack of support for decision to go mp finding unstable approach pilots are more likely than pilots to feel discomfort in being challenged or chal finding unstable approach pilots are likely to feel in about calling for in situations with strong cockpit authority mp finding pilots indicated four times more often than unstable approach pilots that another mem ber was prompting the crew to initiate mp finding unstable approach pilots are less likely than pilots to feel support for safety from their and said they were less likely to be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to landing and more likely to believe that the incentive structure of their company does not discourage unstable approaches to mp finding unstable approach pilots believe that their com criteria for unstable approaches are not mp finding unstable approach in feel regret about continuing an unstable approach more strongly than pilots regret going and feel less positive about the outcomes of their mp finding unstable approach pilots have lower sense of situational awareness across most which leads them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their risk finding pilot norms and processes for continuing unstable approaches provide little foundation for compliant decision making the action is to not go around when mp finding roles and incentives have displaced some influence that good situational awareness should have in risk assessment and decision finding pilots who believe that their criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also on that the threshold for the aircraft to be on profile and in proper configuration is below ft closer to to ft mp finding pilots who believe that their criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also on that they can compensate for energy management until the aircraft descends to ft and under certain below mm finding at the managerial there are indications of general disengagement with the topic of policy and mm finding among there is general lack of awareness of rates of policy finding among there is general lack of awareness of their own company rates of policy finding among managers who have objective noncompliance rate such as flight understanding of the compliance rate is likely mm finding managers who claim to know the company around compliance rate are likely to overstate the compliance rate by over these perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence about mm finding managers perceive moderate degree of fec of their policies and mm finding managers perceive less than moderate level of support within their company for managing li mm finding managers slightly disagree overall that there is concern or need action to improve their compliance mm finding the managers with better understanding of compliance rates for both the industry and their own the high risk perceiver were more realistic and concerned about their low compliance but perhaps have little voice or authority within the company to change policy or mm finding managers who scored higher on the situational awareness measure associated with seeing the current threat as real also scored lower in relative terms on the measure used to compensate correctly for the risk suggesting the presence of with respect to effectively managing this mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores see their current procedures as being unrealistic and definitions of instabilities as being too mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores had the perception that their companies have little will to change and are generally complacent about sops for managing mm finding managers with higher awareness of their compliance rates also feel less support from senior managers and higher level of discomfort with ap them about the mm finding managers who were aware of low compliance rates in their companies scored at or above the midscale on anticipatory and compensatory situational awareness this is minority consisting of percent of mm finding the tendency is to lean toward the single focus of improving the unstable approach rate as the best way to prevent even though empirical data indicate finding safe landing guidelines published by flight safety foundation to address an identified gap in the alar tool kit risk reduction is not well known by operators and not documented in operations strategies for corrective decision making we conclude that there are three categories that can be defined in achieving an effective policy from logi the policy should make sense operationally for most environmental conditions encountered for the people executing the policy and those managing the policy operations and should be acceptable to those externally effected by the application of the policy traffic the policy must be managed effectively by the management this is important not only because of the need to achieve objectives set out by senior management but also because those ut the policy need to see and understand that the policy is being managed management over of the policy is awareness of the policy guidance and the risks associated with not executing the policy must be high for both flight crews and the following is list of recommended making strategies to mitigate dm strategy ensure the policy makes sense update the stable approach definition and sah to maximize their relevance to flight crews and their separate the stable approach definition and criteria from criteria and points to improve awareness that these are two distinct aspects of and that decision making continues beyond the approach this does not imply that they cannot meet at points throughout the approach and it is intended for the sop and communication designers to separate the psychological attachment of these two dm strategy manage the policy operators set specific compliance rate targets for and establish initiatives to achieve authorities amend industry and regulatory audit pro to include standards and recommended practices that address dm strategy increase increase awareness of noncompliance and risks associated with continuing to land when and awareness of the significant impact that pli has on operator flight industry and pilot enhance situational awareness to heighten flight awareness throughout the ap and and landing policy and procedural communication minimize the subjectivity of decision making for the decision maker pf or as per com to mitigate those components of situational awareness that compromise the risk assessment and for by installing stable approach monitoring decision making the following are recommendations for corrective action to mitigate noncompliance and execution each recommendation supports previously identified dm recommendation manufacturers should continue develop of and operators should install stable approach and energy management monitoring and alerting dm recommendation operators should understand their own respective compliance dm recommendation operators should establish internal around compliance rate targets and dm recommendation where flight crew ia and operator management should establish or process in which fda can be used to assist in effectively managing compliance dm recommendation operators and the industry should the stable approach criteria and sah to better align policies with manageable and operational safe see appendix for flight safety new stabilized approach and for industry avoid stable approach criteria and heights that address very that avoid criteria if are not likely to result in or if decision is may transfer risk to maneuver distinguish between profile criteria and energy management criteria and decision point which could have distinct and separate allow for variable objective not all environ create the same risk high tail winds and contaminated runways statistically create the the stable approach although mostly should allow an element of guided decision making that is corroborated between dm recommendation operators should establish and publish safe landing guidelines in operations keys to safe and see appendix revised safe landing for industry dm recommendation operators should develop procedures to be performed during every approach that describes the state of stability and the intention of the decision based on company effective elements of these communications the state of stability is made by the member not responsible for the decision to go around the pm or the first per company this creates shared responsibility for activity in the communication procedures are not passive or conditional call is made at the assigned point during every this forces communication procedures should be objective they should state facts about the this minimizes authority gradients within the communication procedures should be sequential and esca late if the condition is not corrected to within ac calls continue and escalate to defined point at which new directive call is for if an call at ft agl does not result in successful corrective the calls continue every ft until the condition is corrected or critical point is and then directive call is made this maintains continuous situational awareness updating of the similar to warning system active communication should continue well into the ap proach and landing up to the touchdown limit this maintains continuous situational each call should be answered with an ac or call by the decision maker pf or per company the call should not suggest the exclusion of other possible outcomes calling at mini when is an option can have the effect of the window of calling for on the other responding with or assists in keeping decision making dm recommendation operators should apply objective procedures well into the approach and landing including in the touchdown energy management monitoring and alerting systems will minimize the need for dm recommendation operators should create standard descent briefing guidelines that environmental risk instability factors that will result in review of standard decision making in the landing recommendation operators should create standard approach briefing guidelines that update the brief at period just before the approach is dm recommendation operators should understand their spec and flight situational awareness levels and psychological profiles for managing internal dm recommendation operators should provide training to enhance psychosocial awareness and and how they contribute to noncompliant decision dm recommendation operators should ensure no fault around policies are implemented and understood by management and flight dm recommendation operators should ensure that un approach and policies are concise and am including procedures and expectations for recommendation operators should communicate indus rates and internal compliance targets and goals of performance to flight crews and the ag involved in achieving operators also should mmu the potential that improved performance could have on the overall risk dm recommendation state and industry audit such as the iata operational safety audit should establish compliance standards and recommended practices for operators to manage dm recommendation state and industry safety organizations such as those associated with the international civil aviation organization the european aviation safety the faa commercial aviation safety team should review these recommendations and assess inserting them into their safety dm recommendation the aviation community should annually through global aggregate flight compliance rates for both the approach phase and the landing phase of and communicate the findings to the this role is suited to safety organizations such as flight safety dm recommendation the aviation community should develop and implement an initiative that communicates the compliance and the potential that improved performance could have on the ala rate and the overall accident this is role suited to global associations and safety such as flight safety dm recommendation the aviation community should estab new program to provide method for operators to share effective strategies to improve around compliance the information should be incorporated into an existing dm recommendation the industry should establish an fi for the effect of the phenomenon of noncompliance with as labels such as con flight into terrain or loss of control make it easier for the industry to understand and manage label for this phenomenon will do the and in so will help provide foundation for essential effective utility of each recommendation is and each recommendation addresses different finding or as can be seen in appendix holistic approach to implementing these recommendations will have the best overall and as with any significant program and effects should be closely monitored by an appropriate audit

atc should im their mutual understanding of each ex recommendation industry partners should develop around training ex recommendation effective monitoring depends on ensuring that pilots with low relevant experience are able to contribute to safe decision making and ex recommendation pilots and their employers should under that one of the many reasons that violating approach minimums is unacceptable is because evidence indicates that if then becomes the chances of safe transition to the are ex recommendation pilots must be able to demonstrate that they are able to safely execute that begin from both high energy and low energy states at the point where around decision is ex recommendation pilots must be able to exercise tactical as well as procedural when deciding to go around below stabilized approach gate so that safe execution is not hindered by an inappropriate delay in decision validation of this must be achieved through realistic training ex recommendation training for pilots should include range of operational including from positions other than and the designated sta approach scenarios should involve realistic simulation of typical landing weights and ex recommendation training for both pilots and controllers should incorporate lessons learned from operational ex recommendation clear guidance should be provided to pilots on how to act in respect to the three stages of monitoring during landing and alerting and taking members of augmented crews who are observing should have clear understanding of the nature of their to effective ex recommendation if an aircraft has the capability to fly automatic pilot training should be provided and the automation policy should address the ex recommendation pilots must have clear understanding of how the pitch control system works on the aircraft type that they this should be validated by both theoretical testing and use of suitable full flight simulator exercises involving approach and with rather than available and at typical landing ex recommendation review should be conducted to deter whether pilots can lose situational awareness of en conflicting traffic during if other pilots are exchanging radio transmissions with atc in languages other than ex recommendation high priority should be accorded to the provision of approach and missed approach ce dures when current procedures

straightforward procedures are available and published for each these procedures should be designed in consultation with pilots who are representative of those who will be expected to use the which underlie the map for each run as much as be the low below first stop altitude and an early turn in missed approach procedure should be conditional approach procedures xxx but not later than should be the missed approach fix should be located close to the airport to ensure that an aircraft in trouble can be landed immediately on any runway with any chosen by the procedural of the missed approach

regulators should review current mandatory training requirements for both pilots and controllers and should ensure that the conclusions of this report are appropriately flight safety foundation future work establish noncompliance industry label such as or fga to go this is to establish easy as has been accomplished with other such as loc or analyze and at global aggregate unstable approaches and unstable landings to determine the level of associated report global compliance performance develop execution and training guidelines for establish industry noncompliance audit standards and recommended practices with organizations such as the international civil aviation organization and in order to minimize the exposure to unnecessary while ensuring further analysis is required to deter the risk balance point between an unstable approach and the foundation should ensure industry partners pursue this promote the distribution and presentation of this report in and encourage republication in complementing publications and safety project conclusion the problem of policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the largest threat to flight safety the potential impact of improvement in compliance is fi no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go the first and foremost change required is that the industry must improve its awareness of the to achieve shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is the cultural shift will be much easier if the industry shifts as opposed to individual companies making changes on their having said several companies are already attacking this issue the project accomplished the goals set forth in the document announcing the fsf safety understand the noncompliance by flight and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight and to consider the safety risk associated with and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of this not all envisioned products are and this is noted in the report as future work to be done by flight safety works cited honeywell

appropriate interval until the condition is repeated every stabilized approach and decision guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind flight safety guidelines for conducting stabilized approaches and achieving reliable decision why the the current fsf guidelines were established in november and updated in analysis revealed that facets of that guidance are not optimal for effective deci making and that they may encourage for approaches involving very low the overall goal is to improve decision in revising the stabilized approach four objectives must be the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and management resulting in greater acceptance of the safety must be ensured during the approach by mitigating against the common types of alas energy hard tail runway excursions it must be ensured that the resulting are con ducted for approaches of appropriate and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to ma increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on the flight collective situational awareness must be improved through better flight crews indicated in the project research that current guidelines on when must be executed are not realistic for most operational environments and they described what realistic parameters look like from their the criteria for which stable approach is defined can be grouped into three types of flight path profile and configuration gear and speed and energy management of speed and add to these the variable environmental conditions length and and and there are four groups of parameters to be considered when designing stable approach approach gates we can address all stable approach parameters and ala safety issues at three procedural agl configuration gate from ft to depending on aircraft agl stable agl the stable approach criteria are the same at each gate for ap conducted in both imc and ft agl configuration gate previous guidance required that must be con if the flight was not fully stable in with respect to the physics of safety is the same in both imc and in this differentiation of at feet in imc and at feet in vmc is not the new functional significance of the mark is that it is the last suitable point along the approach to ensure that final landing configuration is selected and verified by the flight the flap and gear deceleration to final approach speed and thrust stabilization should occur before the aircraft reaches the next gate at ft it should be emphasized that initial configuration should occur before reaching the this gate is the last point at which final landing configuration should be selected and the gate is familiar demarcation to flight crews and is often accompanied by an automatically generated note that the gate may vary for air type and gross the operator should determine the appropriate height of the based on aircraft ra characteristics and the the following discussion of aircraft energy management during approach is based on the fsf alar briefing notes safety aircraft deceleration characteristics although deceleration characteristics largely depend on the aircraft type and gross the following typical values can be considered for quick assessment and management of aircraft deceleration deceleration on glide with landing flaps and gear to kt per glide path is typically equivalent to descent gradient of or vertical for final approach groundspeed of aircraft with final approach speed of kt would need to be at maximum speed of kt at the gate to be stable at using the median deceleration rate of kt per nm and descent rate of nm gate does not address any particular ala type but serves to facilitate achieving fully stabilized approach at the next lower gate it is in line with pilot as seen in experimental data from the that aircraft configuration and aircraft energy management are two separate and distinct aspects of stabilized and the aircraft energy stabilization height can be lower than the aircraft configuration although may be considered at this not mandating at this point reduces the overall number of potential by allowing unstable approaches to continue at safe analysis is discussed in improved collective situational awareness at this gate is achieved through procedural active communication between flight agl gate previous guidance required that must be conduct if the flight was not fully stable in the revised guid retains the recommendation that the approach should be fully stable at this the mandate to go around has been although may be considered at this not mandating reduces the overall number of potential by allowing unstable approaches to con while at safe analysis is found in not mandating at this gate also aligns with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project indicating can still be executed even from lower altitudes when conditions are stable or have only minor deviations outside the stable approach as this makes operational sense to those who execute and manage the there is better likelihood of the gate is suitable point in the approach for flight crew to verify all stable approach it is familiar mar for flight crews and is also often accompanied by an au generated being stable at this point in the approach allows for subsequent developing instabilities to be compared against state of constant energy improved collective situational awareness at this gate is also achieved through procedural active communication between flight ft agl gate this gate is establishing this gate clearly marks the boundary between higher altitudes where stable approach is strongly recommended and the point where continuing an unstable descent reduces the margin of it differentiates between approach stability and these are two distinct flight and from sy they should remain distinct elements in decision it should be understood that the agl value is not intended to be it can be approximated to take ad of aircraft automatic callout for consider an ils minimum set for ft some ac automatic callout systems provide an alert ft above so in such ft agl could be established as the gate value and utilized in the auto callout in the active call descending in an unstable state below the gate should be warning to flight crews that the level of risk is increasing and action is whether the aircraft is unstable at this gate or becomes unstable below analyses indicate that flight crews who continue an unstable descent below ft do not recognize the need for increased concern or the need for the awareness of the increased need for action can be improved by heightening the definition of the from being in an unstable condition to being in condition to go this can prompt the flight crew to make the correct decision to go martin smith of the group psychological tipping point is the moment of maximum situational is when the flight crew is primed to pull the trigger on the the subtle change to to go is such in other the to go is permission to mis to drawing comparison to another industry the pilot not flying is now known as the pm change that was intended to influence the mindset of the pm and also to alter his behavior in recognition of the importance of similar effect can be realized in identifying an unstable flight condition below ft as condition condition that demands to further emphasize the the to win can be viewed as the stable approach zone with the focus on ensuring that the aircraft is fully the area from ft to can be viewed as the primary where the focus shifts from liz the aircraft to going using rejected takeoff below maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action to stop the airplane within the stop as an rejected takeoff below kt is considered to occur in different regime compared with rejected takeoff above through training and there is shift in psychology for pilots operating in the similar shift can be realized through the approach to lowering the execution altitude reduces the overall number of potential by allowing approaches to continue while at alti it makes the stable approach and policies more in line with flight psychological beliefs and more manageable by prevents risk transfer from risk unstable approaches to potentially and limits unnecessary demands on the air traffic if not fully stable at or below this the decision to go around should be made without below ft is not necessarily this determination depends on the degree and type of approach and aircraft type and performance this gate is essentially the beginning of the primary zone from ft to thrust reverser at this the ala is the most common types of low energy alas are landing hard landing and tail if we analyze the most extreme case of low it is one where thrust is at flight speed is ref and the descent rate is fpm double normal rate of federal aviation regulations part the landing the steady gradient climb may not be less than with the engines at the power or thrust that is available eight seconds after initialization of move of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight idle to power design and construction of the engine must enable an increase from the fixed minimum flight idle power from not more than percent of rated takeoff power or thrust available to percent in not less than five the most limiting of these two regulations is the in our extreme case of descending at using linear anal without taking into consideration lessening of the rate of descent as engines and achieving climb the flight will descend ft figure per ft another useful analysis comes from flight safety alar tool kit which says that an aircraft being flown on while on approach with thrust at flight descending at fpm and with ref at minus will experience an altitude loss of approximately ft safety if we more than double the rate of descent to in this the aircraft would ex an altitude loss of approximately feet alar tool figure it is also interesting to look at design specifications for taws such as the technical standard order for such systems requires for the final approach segment warning be given in time to allow for obstacle clear altitude after recovery that includes pilot response time and standard gravitational era of the tso further describes the altitude loss of an aircraft de at with response time of one second and as being and says the required warning should be given no later than ft above the obstacle figure in comparison with these gate of ft agl to execute provides adequate altitude margin for even the most extreme unstable the margin in this case results in percent increase over the linear part percent increase over the fsf alar determination and percent increase over the taws although the number of approach and landing accidents is greater than the number of the around phase of flight has more fatalities per by ensuring safe altitude of ft to conduct in the extreme unstable and by allowing unstable approaches to continue between ft and the potential number of would be lower the exposure to comparisons of revised gates to industry monitoring and alerting and faa runway overrun prevention references the project identified significant benefits in reducing the subjectivity of the analysis by flight the most impactful way to minimize subjectivity is to employ automated systems similar in

terrain awareness and warning tso technical standard ref reference landing speed flight safety foundation tcas to help flight crews make timely and consistent the industry has developed few systems in the form of stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems for approach and landing energy the airbus runway overrun protection system has number of alerting and monitoring but those that are pertinent to this analysis are the visual alert that begins at ft agl and the aural alert at ft does evaluation of aircraft real energy and the runway distance available for and provides visual too alert at ft and an aural alert at ft because of the lower altitudes at which these alerts and considering the severity of the condition that not enough runway to stop the aircraft really is the only except in the most dire when comparing this condition to the conditions being applied to the proposed stabilized approach and the fsf guide are quite honeywell landing system also has many alerting and monitoring including aural alerts beginning at ft agl and ending at ft agl with an the criteria used by the system to make the alert are variable but based on monitoring excessive approach excessive speed and flap settings honeywell the altitudes where these alerts are given are similar to those recommended in the stabilized ap and achieving collective situational awareness through active communication this project found that situational awareness is lacking among most flight crews who continue an unstable descent and land communication is vital in achieving situational two key types of communication are recommended for improvements approach and landing brief and active communication sops throughout the approach and landing and briefings most airlines already have procedures for which ad the most important aspects of the approach and detailed guidance is provided in fsf alar briefing note safety foundation alar task the following guidance is not intended to replace those briefings but is an addition to current standard briefing improve overall ala awareness improve awareness of specific approach and landing as demonstrated in the project simply knowing few overall statistics can raise situational awareness fi when company statistics are they should be in their the following industry statistics can be alas make up approximately percent of all approximately percent of unstable approaches result in more than percent of runway excursions follow stable approach that becomes unstable after threshold reviewing the effects of runway contamination and tail winds on runway excursions is relevant because they contribute to significant number of runway the flight safety runway safety initiative found that about percent of runway landing excursions are of that percent follow stable of all percent were associated with and with runway the remaining per of runway landing excursions are and of that percent follow unstable approaches safety this project found that awareness of instabilities is important in the landing phase as well as in the approach some simple rules of thumb regarding the effect of poor landing technique on landing distance can significantly improve situational for pilots should plan for landing distances to in by ft per second of ft per kt excess speed from ref on dry ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet ft per ft excess above ft over runway this also applies when the vertical guidance for the ap by places the aircraft higher than ft agl when crossing the landing distances are based on threshold briefings including these statistics and rules of thumb should occur at intervals that will ensure that flight crews have an depth awareness of the for example briefings also should discuss any allowances for flight crews to adjust company policies discussion in safe landing as permitted by guided procedures in the policies themselves for allowing crew to conduct touchdown beyond the normal approach and and briefing briefing should in addition to existing approach briefing an emphasis on approach and landing when company statistics should be periodically the briefing should include approach and landing accident overall alas make up approximately percent of all approximately percent of runway excursions develop from approaches that become unstable after threshold approximately percent of unstable approaches or unstable landings result in runway excursion environmental percent of landing excursions are with wind factor in percent and runway nation factor in about percent of follow

the crews should recap current environmental readiness and any adjustments to policy flight safety foundation touchdown zone as long as adequate landing performance and distance references as briefings often occur minutes or more before an the project findings and suggest that short or refreshment of the current threats and be briefed just prior to the ap during period in the lower this can refresh and flight situational approach and and briefing active communication throughout the approach this project determined that communication is one of the key attributes of effective collaborative decision making by flight by factor of approximately flight crews who comply with their policy had uni about approach and for most crews who con an unstable approach and no one made the actual decision to that there was no communication about the decision to it just the difficulty with calls which are made only if prob condition exists is that in their it is undetermined if the condition the call could be absent for several as explained in the report active force flight crews to discuss or express condition either positive or negative on every it is also important not to overload the flight crew with standard communication and to ensure that they have time to listen to atc and perform other active calls must be short and calls are usually initiated by the pm and responded to by the the call on the approach normally indicates and the response by the pf may either be an ac or directional it is recommended that there be an active call at each ap if the active call indicates an undesired aircraft the call should continue to be made periodically throughout the approach at intervals such as each ft or until the desired state is achieved or is this serves the same purpose as warning from ws or repetitive calls in the to zone also pre the pf for an eventual conclusion if the offending ndi is not that repetitive warning calls prime the and relational as compared with common current procedures in which single go call is made at or which has lesser ef in primarily the hierarchical the implementation of active calls should not imply that and communicative calls such as or be passive calls remain an important component of situational awareness and should be used in with active calls as the following are examples of active calls at approach

point markings are white rectangular one on each side of the runway that begin at the distances indicated the width of the markings varies with the width of the flight safety foundation fsf safe landing guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind the revised flight safety foundation guidelines for safe landing and achieving reliable decision making during the landing as with the stable approach and decision there were several namely that the guidelines make operational sense for both flight crews and manage to improve agreement with the ensure safety during landing by mitigating the common types of landing runway excursions and ensure the resultant are in situations of ap and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to maneuver increases overall and unnecessarily increases demands on improve the flight collective situational the guidelines established here do not replace manufacturer limitations and procedural or state regulations and excursions that occur following an unstable approach are mitigated largely in the approach they can still prevented in the landing large numbers of excursions occur following stable approach that becomes unstable only after the aircraft passes the runway thresh guidelines in this section are targeted at these types of landing excursions are of two in which aircraft run off the end of the runway surface and in which aircraft exit the side of the runway to address these types of we will enhance landing guidelines in four longitudinal limit awareness touchdown zone and lateral limit awareness environmental variability and adjustments to established situational awareness and project findings include that collective situational awareness is low during the landing and although most opera have policies defining where the touchdown should very few have guidance or sops on how to determine where the touchdown or how and when to determine if around should be for most operators spec that the aircraft should touch down in the touchdown zone on the they do not train or specify how to determine if the aircraft has passed the who should make the or how much of deviation from the runway centerline is permissible before should be most pilots say either gut feeling or experience helps them judge when an aircraft has passed the acceptable even though they readily state that their experience does not include from the landing the impact of improving collective situational awareness in the landing phase can be longitudinal limit awareness dz and touchdown zones vary in length with one determining factor being total runway runways of ft and longer have touchdown zones ft long and runways of and longer have touchdown zones long relative positioning markings are present within the dz and are clearly identifiable on the aiming point is the widest marking located at the distance from the threshold and distance from the threshold with the end of the dz being identified by the last marking at ft and approach alerting and monitoring systems such as smart provide aural alerts when an aircraft has passed touchdown when an aircraft passes this area without touching an aural alert such as deep is given honeywell sops then dictate this objective warning immediately enhances crew awareness and leads to better decision in the absence of such the through can be directed to monitor the passing of dz markings and make an active call such as or of after passing the last marking indicating the passage of the in cases in which the runway is contaminated and markings are not couple of options if remaining markers can be using the landing distance of pilots can calculate for an aircraft traveling ft per the normal touchdown area of to ft will occur in four to eight seconds fps seconds to calculations also will show that the end of the dz will pass in approximately seconds fps lateral limit awareness most operators specify that the touchdown shall occur on the runway but do not say how this will hap or who will determine when the aircraft is as important as it is to have situational awareness regarding longitudinal it is equally important to understand lateral manufacturers often provide cockpit visual cues and techniques for determining where the main landing gear is in relation to the aircraft as an boeing says for the the view through lower outboard corner of the forward win to the ground is good visual reference for the outboard side of the main landing gear wheels on the same the lower inboard corner of the forward window is also good reference for the opposite side main gear boeing in the absence of other lateral maintaining the most outboard main landing gears on either side of the centerline is reasonable using visual as in the example can help determine the positioning of the main landing this is considered rough operational guide with its own there are no known alternatives other than relying on the monitor of this positioning can be performed by the pm during the and if he or she sees that the position of the aircraft is he can make an appropriate call in that sops would dictate environmental variability and adjustments to established policies environmental variability can have significant effect on land performance and desired touchdown operators should consider giving flight crews the tools and guidelines to determine when it makes sense to modify or adjust landing and policies for and possibly operational it can be difficult for some operators to consider allowing crew to land beyond the landing combined with sound guidance and policies for operating outside normal makes sense when safe operations are we also have the problem of rules with no room to apply kern said in of these policies begin with good but inside the good we create systems that defy logic and poison the well of which often results in an unintended consequence loss of faith in the system of problems can develop when environmental conditions are such that operating outside established policies makes but there are no guiding principles on how to accomplish for an aircraft landing on run requires landing although the company policy states that should be initiated if touchdown does not occur inside the is it the best course of action as opposed to an option of extending the touchdown point to ft for the answer is if the mark is not if the flight crew can identify this point and if they have briefed the revision to the is it still the best course of action to go in this the transfer of risk to is revised touchdown point can be determined by citing known distance point along the runway taxi runway distance marker or time period one second approximates ft in in another case in which weather and runway conditions demand that touchdown occur before the end of the guid should give crews the methods and means to identify the shorter touchdown for if the crew wants to be touching down within ft of the runway thresh they need references to determine where this will using dz markings or time lapse from the time the aircraft crosses the in any written policies and guidance must be in place to give the flight crew procedures and techniques to modify landing point this should be briefed and agreed upon by all figure approach and landing gates and active end of dz of of deep window window not window not dz touchdown zone calls can be substituted with auto such as flight safety foundation situational awareness and communication figure shows examples of new active calls recommended in the landing phase of in the case of exceeding centerline touchdown it is difficult to define point in the dz where positive centerline active call can be although not in this the use of call may be more that the call is made only when the drift limit is note that stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems accomplish the objectives of some active flight crew calls

use of deter planning and fmc performance cruise performance monitoring can help airlines identify and solve performance performance monitoring will identify need for boeing to assist in determining the solution to given in with good understanding of the monitoring process and the interactions among the variables airlines heir own problem diagnosing and cruise performance monitoring has been used for many years by airlines that strive to operate their airplanes as as these airlines know that continuous cruise performance monitoring of airplanes in their can decrease operating costs relative to airlines that do not monitor airplane performance continuous cruise performance monitoring can give airlines the information they need just the baseline performance levels they use for planning and management computer mc fuel predictions so that the correct amount of fuel is loaded on each and every entify normal deterioration for of ch the airplanes that perform best to their longest entify high fuel burning airplanes for possible validate performance degradation for extended twin operations top critical fuel reserves planning lieu of the regulatory requirement of percent fuel mileage deterioration crease crew in plans and possibly decrease the amount of discretionary fuel requested and an less recognized of cruise performance monitoring is diagnosing and solving various airplane performance problems or these case studies show how cruise performance monitoring was used to determine solutions to three different an airline that operates airplane was concerned about what it considered to be ive fuel mileage deterioration relative to the fuel mileage levels its airplanes exhibited when they were the airline requested help from both boeing and the engine manufacturer in te mining what was causing this deterioration the the or through better understanding of the contributions that airframe and engine deterioration make to the overall fuel mileage the airline could more focus its maintenance to help resolve this the airline proposed an experiment involving an engine exchange airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration by dave flight operations and carolyn aerodynamics engineer aero quarterly ew total fuel mileage diff ence ol to ne airplane using he ol an ne engine between an old and new six which was operating about percent below the planning database level of fuel represented the old while soon represented the new the airline requested assistance and support from boeing and the engine manufacturer in carrying out the which sure pre fuel mileage on both the new and the old airplane swap all four engines between the new and old sure fuel mileage again on both the new and the old airplane by using the same physical set of four engines on two different the and the engine manufacturer agreed that any measurable difference in fuel mileage for the same set of engines on two different airframes could be attributed to airframe effects alone that drag position was that proper maintenance of the exterior of an airplane would lead to minimal amounts of drag deterioration as an airplane as the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including so that it would be considered as having properly maintained exterior before the engine control surfaces were seals were and one engine was minor leak in the pneumatic discovered during the was not by the airline to cause about percent penalty in fuel fuel mileage data was collected before and after the to determine any change across the especially to quantify any changes resulting from rigging the control surfaces and replacing any worn fuel mileage improved percent after the with percent attributed to proper rigging of the controls and percent attributed to the changing of one fuel mileage data was then collected on both the old and new airplanes before and after the engine the data collected was combination of in data collected by the airplane condition monitoring system acm and hand data that was collected under more controlled test average results from all four sets of data were then compared to determine the differences in fuel mileage between the old and new airplanes with the same set of for both the old and new the average improvement in fuel mileage for the new airframe relative to the old airframe was about the initial conclusion could be that the older airframe must contribute about percent toward the overall fuel mileage deterioration originally observed on the old airplane and engine about percent of that difference is of the total calculated difference of the pneumatic duct leakage discovered on the old airplane during the contributed about in the old airplane did not have the same revised vertical fairing as the new if the older airplane had had the newer vertical it is estimated that the fuel mileage would have improved about after adjusting for the pneumatic system leak and the newer vertical for the same set of engines the old fuel mileage averaged about percent worse than the new the results are supportive of the position that the drag deterioration of well airplane most likely will not exceed more than about the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including ration ne vertical fin fairing pneumatic leakage actual unexplainable diff ence case study to help determine the primary cause of the fuel mileage boeing and the airline collected fuel mileage data on both new and old before and after an engine an airline expressed concern to boeing that its new airplanes equipped with aviation partners boeing apb blended winglets were exhibiting fuel mileage performance more than percent worse than the boeing database while its winglet approximately two years displayed fuel mileage performance similar to the database the which collects cruise fuel mileage data on an ongoing based its analysis on acm cruise fuel mileage data analyzed using the boeing airplane performance monitoring apm in initial discussions between boeing and the it was explained that the database being used by the airline to represent the with blended winglets was based on the original winglet test results completed in early this is the same database used in the flight crew operations the mc and the operational planning additional tests had led to best assessment of the delivered performance of the which showed slightly less improvement than the original this revised based on several add al test programs conducted in and includes different winglet drag increment to winglet and an aer elastic correction absent in the earlier at mach the difference between the two databases varies from percent to depending on the exact conditions with the database predicting better fuel mileage increment because of the winglets in all upon the airline provided boeing with acm data for two of its airplanes with blended boeing analyzed the data for each airplane using both the operational database and the revised while the data on about percent closer to the newer database level than the operational database analysis did not agree with the analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the further discussions with the airline revealed that it had been using passenger weight allo of kg per including carry and kg per checked bag for all of its as of june the airline changed to the higher passenger weight allowances recommended in the joint aviation requirements operations ar checked baggage would be weighed whenever ar checked baggage weight allowances would be the average passenger weight allowances are higher than the kg per passenger the airline had been because the data sent to boeing for the two winglet airplanes was collected prior to june it was based on the lighter weight allowance of kg per investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the aero quarterly the analysis was based on data using combination of the weight as the investigation the airline sent additional data to boeing for the same two winglet airplanes but only for conditions recorded after june based on the higher jar weight the airline also included data for one more winglet as well as for three winglet the data for the two winglet airplanes showed an immediate fuel mileage improvement of about percent for each based on analyzing only the data from ar weight allowances collected after june this result led quickly to the belief that the previous kg per passenger weight allowance was too although both the fuel mileage and thrust required changed between data based on kg per passenger and data based on ar passenger weight the thrust fuel consumption tsf hardly errors in the estimated weight of an airplane present themselves as high or low drag but do not affect the fuel tsf deviations calculated by apm improvement was observed for both of the winglet airplanes originally analyzed with data recorded before june the results for all six airplanes were still not as good as what boeing experience indicated for this further investigation determined that this airline operates its of in mix of both scheduled and holiday charter using the ar weight allowances called out for the data sent to boeing for the six airplanes included mixture of data from both these types of the average passenger weight allowance recommended for scheduled service is kg per passenger and kg per passenger for charter service are higher than the kg per passenger originally used by the at the airline separated all of the post june data into two charter service and scheduled the data for each group was reanalyzed separately and the analysis revealed discrepancy in demonstrated fuel mileage and thrust levels between the charter and scheduled if airplane weight is perceived airplane performance will be poorer than weight that is unaccounted for shows up as increased airplane drag and decreased fuel in this the tsf deviations remained consistent between both sets of but the thrust deviations increased for the charter strong indication of unaccounted airplane in this boeing proposed that the jar passenger weight allowances as recommended for holiday charter were underestimating the airplane weight for this particular charter although the airline was receptive to the possibility that the ar passenger weight allowances might be too light for its holiday charter it was not fully the airline believed that the ar weight allowances for scheduled could just as easily be in which case their airplanes were performing as poorly as the charter data to determine which weight allowances were the airline and boeing agreed to collect delivery performance data on the next new airplane with production blended winglets the advantages of collecting delivery data as opposed to in data he performance level of the airplane could be established at he airplane would be weighed at the boeing factory with all the weight changes following weighing but preceding delivery accurately tracked and published in the weight

airline would continue with its standard in data collection on both scheduled and charter comparing the results from the delivery with the results obtained in would help determine which jar passenger weight allowances gave the airline more accurate airplane gross if the weight allowances were too heavy airplane was actually lighter than then the in performance would appear to be better than the delivery if the weight allowances were too light airplane was heavier than then the in performance would appear to be worse than the delivery the airline provided boeing with the weeks of acm in data for the airplane following separating the data for charter and scheduled for this the data was analyzed relative to the most recent with winglets although the delivery results showed the airplane to be slightly better than the demonstrated database the early in charter results show the airplane with an average per fuel mileage percent worse than the demonstrated level unaccounted weight shows up as airplane drag according to the charter the airplane experienced percent increase in thrust required on entering partially offset by percent drop in engine tsf for percent drop in fuel mileage from the delivery when the same ai scheduled service data for the same time period was the fuel mileage was much closer to the delivery average in fuel mileage for the weeks of operation deviated from the delivery level by only percent percent below the demonstrated which is within the acm ability to determine fuel mileage over given time these results supported the conclusion for this the ar passenger

identical to the vor the identifier for orlando executive airport is while the vor identifier is the prefix letter for canada is and for alaska is there are several exceptions in in many ports with three letter identifiers receive the prefix but there are many that the most reliable method of determining an alaska airport identifier is to look it up from the airport name or see tion points by name or you can program the kln to default to certain letter as when you are entering point see section to learn about this handy all airport identifiers receive the prefix airport identifiers which are combinations of letters and numbers do not apply to the prefix examples of airport identifiers not using the prefix are and if you are entering or looking for an airport that is all letters then it will begin with prefix in the contiguous in alaska some or in if there are numbers in the identifier then prefix is not for other areas of the world the airport stored in the kln data base is

frequencies can and on and chapter by faa you are required to have data base in order to use the kln for data base is contained in small card which plugs into the side of the kln front it is designed so that there are two ways for the user to easily keep the data base the first is to electronically update the data base by means of diskette supplied by honeywell and an personal this method does not have to involve removing the kln from the instrument usually mounted in the instrument provides means of interfacing the kln with the computer via an interface the diskettes are not returned to second method of data base update is to remove the old and insert current this method involves returning the old card to honeywell receives new from en this information is processed and loaded onto both diskettes and data base honeywell makes these two types of update services available to you in choice of several subscription or random update see section for details on these sends the update so that it arrives prior to the effective the new update may be installed any time prior to the effective date and the kln will use the previous data up to the effective date and automatically begin using the new data on the effective the accuracy of the data base information is assured if it is used before the end of the effectivity use of out of date data base information is done entirely at the own computer updating of the data base update information is sent to you on in order to use update program you must have access to computer having disk drive capable utilizing megabyte high density this computer also needs to have an available com or com ial if you wish to perform updates in the an optional pc interface kit must be included in the kit is an interface cable that plugs into both the computer and into the data loader the data loader jack is included with the kln installation kit and is typically installed in the instrument ata base chapter data chapter the data base must be updated only while the craft is on the the kln does not perform any navigation function while the data base is being since data base update takes approximately minutes it is good idea to turn off all electrical equipment on the aircraft except for the kln to avoid running down the aircraft diskettes sent to you can only be used to update kln although they can update that specific unit numerous the first time the diskettes are used in an update unique identification code from the kln being used is uploaded to the these diskettes may be used in this specific kln an unlimited number of times which

if it was actually functioning in an distances count points and the tion bar follows the progress of the simulated using the mode is an excellent way to learn the operation of the kln without worrying about the engine other or even these phenomena are not simulated in the kln approaches and and approaches and this is the last chapter on the operation of the kln in this chapter you will learn how to use the kln for approach and note that only kln which are configured for ifr approaches are capable of performing the procedures discussed in this kln which are figured for en route and terminal operations only will give you access to procedures but not all of these procedures require that you are comfortable with the operation of the unit as presented up to this in you need to be comfortable with flight plan operation and and the obs mode approach operations flying approaches using the kln are not in selves very it is different than using traditional equipment such as and with this in make sure that you practice with the kln in vfr weather with check pilot before attempting to use the kln in actual ifr the kln obtains approach information from the data it is extremely important that the data base is the kln is approved for ifr approaches only when the data base is if you attempt to select an approach when the data base is out of you will be given the base in the bottom left portion of the screen as following sections assume that your kln is installed in the aircraft with all of the necessary accessories to fly in most cases this will mean that the craft has external to arm the approach an external annunciator to indicate when message is active and when point sequencing is about to occur will also be in some installations the aircraft will have switch to select which navigation source is displayed on the primary hsi or nav page has been specifically designed to provide most the functions needed for this page an interface that presents pertinent navigation way to access the flight and graphic presentation of the sent position relative to the flight plan you will find this page to be good friend while performing gps based approaches and and there are some approach procedures in the world that not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data therefore it is not possible to use the kln for these it is good flight practice ensure that the kln contains anticipated procedures for the addition to the two course modes and described in there are also two approach these are approach arm and approach the status of the approach mode is ed on an external in most installations the external annunciator will indicate for the approach arm and approach active will be annunciated by the main ence of these modes from the normal en route mode is that the integrity monitoring is set to tighter another difference between these modes and the en route mode is that the cdi scale factor will usually change to nm for arm and will always change to nm when in the apr the arm mode can be selected in two the normal way is that this mode will be selected automatically by the kln when the aircraft is within nm of an airport and an approach is loaded in the flight plan for that it is possible to arm the approach mode at distance greater than nm from the airport by pressing the al gps approach but the kln will not change the cdi scale factor until the aircraft reaches the nm if the gps apr external switch is pressed while the approach mode is then the kln will disarm the approach and change back to en route the cdi scale factor will also change back to the approach can be by simply pressing the gps apr switch the apr mode can only be engaged automatically by the to cancel the apr mode press the external gps apr this will change the mode to apr once past the it is not possible to return to the approach active mode without missed approach and flying back to the procedure for approaches approaches will all have the general flow of events refer to figure and load the approach into the flight can one at almost any time but must be completed before reaching the final approach fix and should be done as

greater than nm the order is for is nm from lax while is nm from the aircraft is not too far from the destination the nav can be used to determine where some of these points are relative to others in the at the time of this all of the nos charts and some en charts do not show the special points that are required for gps for this reason it is good idea to understand what the special points are used for and what they may have also noticed that some points have small at the end of the point the small letter is an aid that we have added to the name of some points to help you recognize important points in the these suffixes are displayed on many of the kln the definitions of these suffixes the initial approach fix of the the final approach fix of the approach the missed approach point of the approach the missed approach holding point for the every approach will have and almost all will have an iaf and missed approach holding another item that you should notice the flight plan is the line that has on it this is what is referred to as fence and the purpose of this line is to tell you approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and kln will not automatically sequence past the point precedes the the point before the fence is always the missed approach the reason that point sequencing is not allowed is that many missed approach procedures require specific actions before going to the missed approach holding point climbing on fixed heading until reaching an changing or deleting an approach loaded into the flight the sequence of points that are retrieved from the data base of the kln define the approach procedures as they are to ensure that the proper path over the ground is it is not possible to either delete or add points to the approach section of the flight to help you see which points are en route points and which are approach the kln does not display colon next to the point number on the pl page if the point is an approach it is only possible to replace the existing approach with another delete the entire approach from the flight replace an existing or delete an the left page displaying the active flight plan turn the cursor on by pressing the cursor so that it covers the approach header at the top the approach once the cursor comes over the approach it will automatically change to read if you in this condition the kln bring up the apt page that corresponds to the current at this point it is ble to select different approach different or you press the button the cursor is over the approach header it will change to read delete if you press the kln vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and remove the entire approach procedure from the active flight if the kln was in the approach arm or the approach active then deleting the approach will cause the kln to change back to en route this means that the cdi scale factor will change back to the default nm example no procedure turn now that you know the basics of inserting an approach into the we can now show the approach operation of the unit by several this first example will use the approach that was loaded into the flight plan in section this example will show how the kln sequences through an approach and what type of and scale factor changes can be the kln will remain in the familiar leg mode so there will be no need to change between leg and obs mode in this refer to the approach plate for this approach to see what the procedure looks this example it is assumed that you are on an active flight with the final destination being the los angeles international it is also assumed that atc will not give you radar vectors during this the vor approach to lax as demonstrated in tion you are within nm of the the kln will ically arm the approach mode and provide the following alt to set the message acts as reminder to make sure the kln is the correct barometric if the barometric information is not then the integrity monitoring provided by the kln will not be as good as it could press to bring up the alt page verify that the barometric pressure is if the kln is interfaced with compatible air data that provides the correct barometric pressure to the kln then the previous message is not displayed and it is not necessary to update the barometric this time the kln will smoothly change the cdi scale factor the external approach annunciator installed in the aircraft will indicate that the approach is in the arm kln approaches and and you approach the kln will provide point alerting on the external annunciator as well as on the screen of the kln once you pass the kln will ically sequence to the next point in the approaches and and may be good time to select the nav this page is especially useful for getting feeling of where you are in the approach the aircraft approaches the the kln will again provide point as the aircraft passes and sequences to the kln will provide message telling you to set the external indicator or to new if desired track is shown on the this value will flash when the external selected course does not match the tk within the aircraft approaches the it is good idea to check over the status of the kln look at the kln screen to verify that leg sequencing is the kln will not transition to the approach active mode if the obs mode is if the kln shares an hsi or cdi with other nav it is also good to verify that the switch is set to the time the aircraft is nm from by the final approach the kln will make prediction to see if integrity will be available at the and at the if the diction indicates that integrity monitoring will be and aim is currently the kln will change the gps apr annunciator to read at this time the kln will also start to change the cdi scale by the time the aircraft reaches the the cdi scale factor will be down to fix is not included in the list of points provided in the data you will need to identify this point by using the along track distances given in the profile view of the approach in this example is located nm from the when the distance to is then the aircraft is at and you can descend to the for this approach procedures require that you add up distances to be able to identify step down vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and kln will again provide point alerting as you approach this is shown on the nav page by flashing active point identifier following steps would need to be performed if missed approach is reaching and not seeing the runway you decide to perform missed the kln will not automatically sequence past the missed approach this is shown on the nav page by not showing any lines connecting points that are past the to perform the published missed approach press to bring up the the default point will be the first point of the missed approach in this case the first point is confirm this point as the direct to point and press reaching the kln will sequence to the next point in the missed approach in this there is no holding pattern published for the missed approach so you can expect further instructions upon reaching atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th example an approach that is quite common is an approach that is based off fan an example of this is the vor rwy approach to clovis new mexico municipal to fly this procedure as published use the following steps and refer to figure for the for this example assume that the aircraft approaches and and approaching from the northeast going the clovis airport with no active flight the approach into the flight plan as described in section in this case there is only one iaf so the kln does not present the option for you to select an in this there is no active flight plan to begin with so the kln will ask to add the approach to pl the area atc tells you to go the vor and clears you for the approach to this is easy to do from the nav page by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning through the active flight plan by turning the inner once is displayed in the scanning window press and then to direct to operation to the distance of nm to the the kln will give the following required select this message provides reminder that to fly course reversal obs mode needs to be note from the approach chart that there is opt arrival sector for this if you are ing within the indicated area there is no need to perform course reversal and you need to ignore this the opt sector is not stored in the data base so it is not possible for the kln to know if course reversal is required or as the kln will always give this message whenever point could be used for course the kln will properly sequence to the to map leg and transition to the approach mode when nm from the you are approaching from any other direction course reversal is required and the obs mode will need to be if the obs mode is not selected before reaching then the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach this is not desirable when performing course reversal so the obs mode must be selected before reaching the kln will only remind you to select obs mode if iaf is the active therefore if course reversal is make sure the iaf is the selected approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and course reversal is then upon reaching perform the appropriate holding pattern entry and set the inbound course on the external cdi or in this example the inbound course is at this point the kln works very similar to al established on the inbound course of switch back the leg when leg mode is selected the is cally made the active point when the iaf and the are at the same is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor this will make the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active the aircraft is nm from the the kln will verify that the proper integrity is if integrity monitoring is available for the then the kln will change to the approach active this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to reaching the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach fix at dme from along the final approach course is not included in the points that come from the data since the distance that the kln is giving you is distance the you will need to mentally figure out when the has reached this is done by looking at the along distances given in the plan view of the in this case the fix is nm from upon reaching this distance you can descend to the for this missed approach is required for this then the steps would be published missed approach procedure for this approach is to make climbing left turn to feet and proceed direct to the in this case will be the default direct to point kln approaches and and is this is the desired point so press to confirm the point and proceed direct to the if atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to the aircraft approaches you will need to select obs mode to stop point sequencing and define the inbound course for the holding if you do not select the obs mode before the aircraft is within nm of the holding then the kln presents message reminding you to select the obs another attempt at the approach is desired after itis necessary to manually change the active when the and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active point to the when you change from obs to make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active example radar for this example we will use the same approach that was used in previous section except this approach will be conducted with the help of radar vectors from approach the aircraft will be assumed to be arriving from the although this does not change the way the approach will be flown using the kln approach has been selected and entered into the flight plan and the aircraft is going direct to vn new mexico as described in section soon as atc mentions radar vectors you should immediately start to think of the obs once given radar change the active point to and select the obs note that it is not important what order these events take it is just as effective to change to obs mode and then change the active point as it is to change the active point and then switch to obs change the selected course on the cdi or hsi to the final approach for this the inbound course is is now possible to watch your progress on the nav page and anticipate when you will be given new headings to fly established on the inbound you will need to change back to the leg mode to allow for proper approach operation and automatic leg for best the change back to leg mode should be made before the aircraft is nm from the it is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor this will make the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active rest of this approach would be flown using the same steps as presented in section and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and example another common type of approach is an approach that is based onan these could be either vor or ndb an example of this type of approach is the vor rwy approach to bowman airport in kentucky the airport identifier for this airport is approaches and and this example assume that the aircraft is approaching lou the nabb passing the nabb you are told to expect the vor approach at you load the approach using the procedure described in section the distance from the present position to the destination airport reaches the kln will automatically arm the approach the cdi scale factor will transition to nm and the kln will provide more sensitive integrity you also press to update the barometric the aircraft is nm from the qm the kln will give message reminding you to select the obs the obs mode is required for the procedure after passing select the outbound course of the external cdi or aircraft is now headed outbound for the procedure as soon you will need to change the active point to the final approach this is done by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning until is displayed in the dow then pressing then pressing the course will still be what is ed on the external cdi or hsi the obs mode selected and as the active it is possible to fly the procedure allow enough distance past to complete the procedure turn and still be nm away before reaching the after completing the outbound portion of the procedure change the selected course to the inbound course of the external cdi or established on the inbound course the leg mode will again need to be selected so that proper approach operation and point sequencing will is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the apt vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th kln approaches and and this makes the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active the aircraft is nm from the the kln will verify that the proper gps integrity is if integrity monitoring is available for the then the kln will change to the approach active this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to point alerting will occur as the aircraft passes the final approach the leg from the final approach fix to the missed approach point will become active and the cdi scale factor will remain at if the auto scale factor was selected on the nav then the scale factor will zoom in on the airport as the aircraft gets closer and closer to the missed approach eventually the map scale changes to following steps are followed if missed approach is missed approach instructions call for climbing left turn to heading of intercepting the course to missed approach holding to fly this with the kln it will be necessary to put the kln into the obs mode and make the active change the selected course on the external cdi or hsi to the aircraft reaches you will need to perform holding pattern entry suitable for this holding pattern and set the selected course to the holding example dme dme arc procedures with the kln are completely different using traditional vor and dme worry because dme arc procedures using the kln are also easier than using traditional this is because the kln guidance around the no more having to watch distance in one place and radial in being dme arc is really whole bunch of approach fixes placed one next to each other to form an very rarely do you actually fly to the beginning of an especially in radar the flight path of the aircraft generally intersects the arc at some once the aircraft is near the it is then possible to turn so that the arc distance is maintained until time to turn to the inbound following example will show how dme arc procedures are using the kln this example approach will be to use the vor rwy approach to the approach plate for this approach is in figure assume that the aircraft is approaching from the north and is in radar assigns the vor rwy turn to the apt page for to select the you select the vor approach and the kln sents the iaf selection page are five choices for the three of these choices you can recognize but the other and are ar and not shown on this these two points are the data base identifiers for the ends of the means dme arc is the radial on which the point and cates the distance of the is the twelfth letter of the alphabet so the indicates that this is dme in similar manner can also be in this example the aircraft is approaching from the north so the iaf will be kln knows that this point is associated with dme once an arc point is the kln determines what radial of the reference vor the aircraft is presently located point is created that is located at the intersection of the sent radial and the dme this point is the first point in the list of points presented on the apt page before approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the approach into the flight this point is named using the same tion discussed the present radial from the reference vor is outside of the defined then the kln will default to the beginning of the approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the kln does not take into account the try of the active flight plan when determining the arc intercept this point is defined solely on the present radial and the defined arc distance from the reference for this reason it is better to delay selecting approaches that contain dme arcs until the aircraft is closer to the the cursor over add to pl press the approach will be loaded into the active flight plan just like any other approach would the approach is loaded into the flight plan the kln may give the pts in edit en route pts as this message is given because very often it will be necessary it the active flight plan to ensure that proper point ing examine the flight plan if observe the nav page to make sure that the sequence of points does not have any unnecessary legs in kln will now provide guidance to the arc intercept the nav page displays the entire arc on the the tion that is between the beginning of the arc and the arc intercept is drawn with dashed the part that is between the arc ept point and the end of the arc is drawn with the normal solid line some cases atc may provide radar vectors to the the kln provides means to define new intercept point based on the current track of the aircraft over the this can be done from either the nav page or from the pl the dashed line displayed on the nav page will help you to mine if atc is giving you correct the nav pull out the right inner knob to bring up the point scanning the right inner knob until the first point of the arc is in this for approaches this will have small appended to the point if the recalculation is to be done from the pl then turn on the cursor and move it over the first point of the and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure either page press this will change the point to read if it is desired to recompute the arc intercept point then press if new arc intercept point is not desired then press was then kln will calculate an arc intercept point based on the present track of the aircraft over the the present track does not intercept the then kln will display no tin the scratchpad area of the the aircraft approaches the arc the kln will provide point alerting and turn anticipation to join the established on the arc the kln provides ance relative to the curved distance to the active point is the distance from the present position to the active not the distance along the refer to appendix for the geometry of the the the desired track will be constantly to help you keep the orientation correct the nav page will ically display tk on the fourth it is not possible to change this to something else while on the the value played for the desired track will flash when the difference between the cdi or hsi and the current desired track is greater than dme arcs have defined radials that serve as step down these points are not stored in the data to help you determine your position relative to these points along the the kln will display new value in the bottom right corner of the display on the nav this new bit of tion is denoted by the letters arc followed by three three numbers represent the current radial that you are on relative to the reference the arc radial is forced into this position when the aircraft is nm from the the display is shown in figure just watch this value and when it reads the same as one of the points you can descend as this particular example does not have such but there are quite few approaches that approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and performance may not be satisfactory if coupled the nav mode while flying the many autopilots were never designed to fly curved if autopilot performance is not tory while flying dme select the mode and keep changing the heading bug to keep the the aircraft approaches the end of the the kln will provide point alerting and turn anticipation to the next the aircraft is nm from fow the the kln will attempt to transition to the approach active since the dme arc procedure is flown entirely in the leg mode the only possible problem would be if the integrity monitoring did not check visual descent point is identified by the along track ance to the map to be when the aircraft reaches this point and the way environment is in it is possible to descend for missed approach is needed use the following missed approach calls for climb to and then left turn direct to the kln will not automatically sequence past the feet has been reached press the approach holding point will be the default direct to press to confirm the direct to point and proceed to the fow atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to obs mode will need to be selected to accomplish the ing if this is not done before the aircraft is nm from the kln will provide message reminding you to select the obs vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure another attempt at the approach is desired after itis necessary to manually change the active when the and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active point to the when you change from obs to make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active approach very rarely there will be problem with the integrity of the gps tem while you are conducting approaches with the kln in some cases the kln will determine that there will not be sufficient integrity monitoring for the leg between the and the or aim is not currently in these cases the kln will not go into the approach active mode and will present the ing not apr mode inhibited predict aim on th these cases you will not be able to finish the approach there is insufficient integrity the th page provides means for you to predict when aim will be to perform aim prediction on the th page two pieces of ation are the first is the location that the prediction will be for and the second is the time for the destination point by be the missed point of an approach loaded in the flight if there is no approach in the flight then the default point is the last point in the active flight of course it is possible for you to enter any point in this time used for the aim prediction will be the current eta to the destination airport or the this time is automatically updated by the kln so there is usually no need to enter if you are making aim calculation for planning it is also possible to enter time in this an important point about this time is that the time used for aim prediction is always in the future and limited to hours from the present for if the time is now and the time entered for the eta is then the prediction will be made for the next day not one hour approaches and and to perform manual aim the left outer and inner knobs to select the th the cursor will be over the aim the desired point identifier by using the inner and outer knobs just like you do for any other point the desired point identifier is entered press press again the point information is cursor will now be over the eta use the inner knob to enter the desired note that the current time zone is displayed next to the eta use the outer knob to move the cursor over the minutes use the inner and outer knobs to select tens of minutes and single utes as when the desired time is selected press aim calculations will aim calculation will usually take few seconds before an answer is during this time the th page will be as shown in figure the aim calculation is the th page will cate the results of the example is shown in figure and aim is available from minutes before eta until minutes after aim is ed not to be available from then until minutes after the by showing the times when aim will be available it is possible for you to how to alter your eta to ensure that there will not be any aim more rare will be the case the kln cannot provide sufficient integrity monitoring or if there is an actual satellite failure while the craft is on the leg from the to the in these cases the kln approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th

apr for this message is telling you to cancel the approach mode by the external this will change the unit to the mode and navigation information will be procedures the kln allows access to navigation instrument and stars terminal arrival by procedures stored in the data base can only be considered accurate as long as the data base is even though the data base contains sid and star there is lot of information that is not included in the data the paper chart is still the primary source of for many procedures require the aircraft to fly to certain along heading until intercepting and many other procedures that the kln can not automatically many procedures require pilot action to ensure that the proper path is flown over the the main purpose of loading sid or star into the active flight plan is to provide you with quick way of loading potentially large number of and star procedures can be as challenging to fly as some approaches therefore it is mandatory that you are comfortable with the operation of the kln before attempting to fly sid and star in flight plan operation and the obs mode should be second nature to are some procedures in the world that not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base and therefore the points that make up these procedures would have to be entered it is good preflight practice ensure that the kln tains anticipated procedures for the and star procedures are stored with the airport for which sid and star procedures are accessed through the apt if there are both and stars for given then there will be two apt one to select sid and the other to select this is indicated by it is also possible to have only sid or only star in which case there is only one apt approaches and and sid and star procedures are defined in three the parts are the sid or star name transition and runway specific component rw the apt pages lead you through the selection selecting sid use the following procedure to select some steps may not be necessary depending on the procedure that you wish to for this the porte nine departure from san francisco international will be select on one of the airport pages if you are operating from an active flight plan you can use the act page for by scanning through the active flight plan section not already rotate the right inner knob until the apt page appears as in figure make sure that is displayed in the upper right corner of the this will allow the tion of sid the cursor on by pressing and rotate the right knob until the flashing cursor is over with the

the only difference is the order of the steps to define the star and where the star is loaded into the flight the steps required to define acton four arrival with the wink tion serve as an example of how to select this star is to the worth international airport select dfw on one of the airport pages if you are operating from an active flight plan you can use the act page for dfw by scanning

in the active flight then the kln will ask to add this point to the active flight is not possible to load sid or star into flight plan than pl sid and star procedures are deleted from after the power is off for more than editing sid or from the proceeding two examples you may have noticed that and star procedures have procedure just as approaches it is possible to use these headers to delete and

departure loaded into the flight plan in section will be remember that was selected meaning that the procedure is applicable to both runways and the fellows transition was also this procedure is one of the more difficult that you are likely to come most procedures are not this but this sid serves as good example for what steps to take when you encounter difficult fly this procedure use the following steps and refer to the chart this sid the sid as described in section procedure states and proceed via sfo the dme fix at or above to accomplish this of the put the kln into the obs mode

procedures the required to fly acton four arrival to worth international will be shown in this this procedure is considerably simpler than the sid example shown in section for this example assume that the aircraft departs from el texas and files for the acton four arrival with the wink use the lowing steps to fly this procedure with the kln and refer to the chart for this star the star into the flight plan as described in section star is very simple and the kln will automatically guide the aircraft along the proper route until the qn before reaching qn examine this procedure and notice that there are two different routes depending on what type of craft is flying the turbojets fly to creek intersection while fly to the data base in the kln has the sequence of points for the turbojet procedure not the sequence for is extremely rare to have different path over the ground turbojets and but be sure to cross check with your paper and and if the aircraft you are flying in is then fly the rest of the star as depicted on the chart with no changes to the flight if the aircraft is not turbojet then follow these to the pl page and delete the following and to do this turn on the cursor

was originally conceived and implemented by the united states department of defense the system able to all civilian users free of gps provides extremely precise and time satellites are not as is the case with weather and television that each satellite is not above fixed spot on the earth all the but rather is continuously moving across the in each satellite completely orbits the earth two times per department of defense imposes an intentional accuracy of the gps this degradation is known as selective availability when sa is only military users have access to full gps for civilian position accuracy is degraded to no worse than at the time of this selective availability is on therefore accuracy is ly of the position determining the technique used to determine position is fundamentally very the complicated part is accounting for and correcting all the possible errors in the gps receiver is able to determine the time it takes radio to travel from the satellite to the gps since this radio signal travels at the speed of light statute miles per the time delay can very easily be used to determine the distance from given if measurements are taken from four satellites three satellites and an input from an aircraft the receiver can identify its position very appendix appendix for the gps receiver might determine that it is miles from satellite miles from satellite and miles from satellite at the same the aircraft altimeter might be indicating an altitude of feet there is only one point in space that satisfies these four data signals two of the primary types of signals that the gps satellites broadcast are almanac and ephemeris these signals enable the gps receiver to quickly lock on to the satellites in the receiver would have to look for each of the satellites to determine which ones could be data is very crude data which describes the orbital position of the each of the satellites transmits the almanac data for all so gps receiver has only to listen to one satellite in order to know which satellites are the at that particular almanac data is good for about six so when you turn the receiver then back on month it will know what satellites to look data is very precise data which each satellite transmits tell the gps receiver exactly where it is and what its orbital will be for about the next four each satellite transmits its own unique ephemeris appendix not to gps system the gps system is composed of three the the control and the user space segment consists of the star satellites which orbit the earth at an altitude of nautical the satellite orbits are very precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the gps system hours every there are almost always more than six satellites in view from anywhere on control segment consists of network of and control the master control station is located in colorado all satellite data which is collected by the other ground stations is assimilated and analyzed at colorado based on these ephemeris updates as tem clock are sent to the satellites through radio transmitters at the ground these ground stations are located at kwajalein of hawaii in the central pacific diego garcia the indian and ascension the south atlantic an owner of gps you can now claim to be member of the gps user gps has many users and and more are being dreamed up all the not only are aircraft using gps so are military systems and and personal automobiles and transport trucks use intelligent transportation or to find their and track their some biologists attach gps receivers to animals to monitor their movement and migration geologists even use gps to track the movement of ers and to analyze plate tectonics of the an exciting new technology as we move into the autonomous integrity monitoring is function that every gps receiver must continuously perform to assure an accurate one characteristic of the gps space and control segments is that they instantly fix satellite if it sending misleading positioning for this gps receiver rely on the gps satellites to tell it when there is the words indicate that the gps kln appendix appendix on can detect an inaccuracy in the gps it does this by using distance measurements from as many satellites as possible to check the consistency of the position is called an position there are not enough satellites in view to assure the position the kln notifies the five measurements with good geometry positions of the are needed to provide this means that at least five satellites or four satellites and pressure altitude input from the altimeter are required assure aim if this check shows some sistency in the the kln notifies the user that other navigation sources should be used to the sometimes the receiver is unable to assure the position to enough accuracy for the phase of due to the location of the satellites at that availability is very seldom difficulty when in the en route terminal phases of the allowable limits are much tighter when approach is performed with kln for this the kln other page allows the pilot to enter time and and the gps receiver will predict if aim will be available to shoot the see section for more information about the aim prediction receiver the kln and kln use an honeywell gps receiver known as the gps it was dubbed this way because it is cal in size to an everyday credit and its faster

checking the course was verified to fulfill the requirements of amc in an acceptable way this type rating training course is an intense and demanding additional training should be considered for pilots without any previous experience with efis and the safe operation of the airplane is predicated upon the at all times and of both of the flight modes and flight strict adherence to crew coordination procedures in as well as in abnormal situations is essential and should be regarded as these specific to aircraft type and to should be fully integrated in the the training should be made aware of the specific crew coordination procedures as established by the before training is pilots having no relevant experience with the app cation of crew coordination proc dures will benefit from course on this pilots having no relevant experience with the operation of an integrated flight management system and flight guidance like the collins pr will benefit from on this these specific additional courses should ideally be completed before the full flight simulator training emergency procedures are an essential part of the training to avoid confusion during as well as during actual the training organization and the candidate pilots need to be made aware of the items to be performed without immediate reference to the these steps should be defined before training is preferably by

significant findings and readers and front line managers who may need or want more details of the research and and complete listing of findings and recommendations can refer to the full report that the noncompliance problem approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for aviation accounting annually for approximately percent of all flight safety foundation study of years of runway excursions determined that percent could have been avoided with decision to go in other percent of all accidents could potentially be prevented by going it is generally felt that an unstable approach is the primary cause of landing within this just over half of the landing excur followed fully stable in these the flight became unstable only during critical industry policy designed to help prevent such accidents is the and the collective industry performance of complying with policies is extremely poor approximately percent of unstable approaches result in policy why is critical policy designed to prevent the most common type of accident ignored by flight and why is that policy not being managed effectively by improving the compliance rate holds tremendous potential in re approach and landing accidents the itself is not without there is an increased risk in loss of control events during compared to exposure with all other phases of it follows that we should only go around when the risk associated with an unstable approach is greater than the risk associated with what is that and how do we minimize exposure to only those that are really the flight safety foun making and execution project was launched to research and answer the question are we so poor at complying with established it was also intended to improve our understanding of the risks associated with executing and to make com to improve compliance and mitigate risks with the maneuver the full report includes complete find strategies and recommendations for industry corrective and future work as it is meant as source for the development of operator refer products such as guidelines and research and analysis many alas have been investigated thoroughly over and much is known about contributing what is is an understanding of the psychology of pli research and analysis of decision making have been conducted primarily from the psychosocial science perspective to gain an understanding of the psychological drivers of and to identify corrective steps that can be based on this is the first industry of its type for this specific the presage group conducted the research and based on its situational model of nine distinct or from two global studies via one survey analyzed the psychology of noncompliance by flight and the other examined the psychology of actions in handling company detailed analysis can be found in the full for the execution an accident and incident review was conducted that included selection of published accident and serious incident re about events involving transport category aircraft between and total of events were in the safety of the was central to the accident or incident in th the aftermath of the was the main purpose of the the events involved jets twin turboprops and jets the safety aspects and overall level of risk of each event were analyzed and characterized by review each event was assigned to one of three categories according to the degree of risk presented by the high risk moderate risk and in the two six safety issues were identified with respect to the ia and conduct of each most of the bearing events were associated with single but five events were associated with two each event also was assigned one of three loss of controlled flight into terrain or midair significant findings an effective policy has three main it is well thought out and clearly written to balance the needs of safety and company management handles the policy and company front line aware is such that the policy is carried out research revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the operator and employee significant findings the collective industry norm is to accept the pli of despite empirical data that indicate this is the most common contributor to the industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable approaches as the sole means to reduce even though empirical data show that unstable approaches affect less than half of runway overall awareness of ala risks and of the impact those risks have on approach and landing safety is management is generally disengaged from noncompliance and has low awareness of the impact it has on perception of risk is pilots do not see current policy criteria as realistic for the operational effective decision making in flight deck com cation is although considered normal flight eu are as reported by flight one in has potentially hazardous such as an aircraft for there are variable techniques and depending on the point during the approach when the around procedures and training do not adequately address many of these pilot experience in the aircraft type affects including complex controller radio can affect recommendations it is evident that the state of noncompliance has been steady for many years and will remain steady unless changes are first and the industry must improve its awareness of the shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is the cultural shift will be easier if the industry shifts as opposed to individual attacking the issue on their as several are already as stated three key attributes of an effective policy the policy makes operational sense to both the employees who execute it and those who manage the policy is managed effectively to level that satisfies company and the employees who should follow the policy are very aware of that policy and the environment in which it is as the following recommendations touch upon these key more detailed recommendations can be found in the full strategic recommendations for decision making include the ensure the policy makes sense update the stable approach definition and stable ap height to maximize their relevance among flight and their manageability among separate the stable approach definition and criteria from criteria to improve aware that these are two distinct aspects of and that decision making is viable beyond the defined approach this separation does not imply that these two distinct areas cannot meet at points throughout the approach and it is intended for developers of standard operating pro dures and communication procedures to break the psychological attachment of these two manage the policy operators set specific compliance rate targets performance and establish initiatives to achieve amend industry and regulatory audit programs to include standards and recommended practices that address noncompliance increase situational increase awareness of and risks associated with continuing to land when and the significant impact that noncompliance has on alas operator flight industry and pilot enhance situational awareness aware to heighten flight awareness throughout the approach and landing policy and procedural communication minimizing the subjectivity of decision making for the decision maker the pilot flying or to mitigate those components of situ awareness that compromise the risk assessment and each recommendation helps improve the psychological riv that affect good decision and it is this ec that the recommendations were specifically designed to although all strategic recommendations are important and should be implemented as part of holistic few are worth if an operator has the means to install automated stable approach and land alerting it should be these systems address many of the psychological issues associated with noncompliance and could be the single most effective way to improve management must be more involved in managing the an area where management has been very much key steps to be taken by management are to set compliance rate targets consistent with safety management system prin and to investigate and follow up on each approach that continues to an unstable flight crew situational awareness needs to be improved primarily through better communication throughout the approach and which can be achieved largely through active communication techniques as part of standard strategic execution ensure that training and awareness pri reflect different execution risk review procedures and men to maximize their clarity and ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitoring during landing and as with any significant program and effects should be closely monitored by pri audit programs such as flight data analysis line operations safety audits or international air trans association operational safety audits action taken in light of the findings and it is appar that revisions are required to flight safety elements of stabilized and safe landing guidelines analysis indicates there are facets of that guidance that are not optimal for effective decision making and that may encourage for approaches that may be of very low when this report was being the analysis for such revisions had already taken but the project review committee recommended an operational trial before changes in the guidelines are formally appendices and for flight safety foun stabilized approach and for industry and safe landing for industry project conclusion the problem of policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the greatest threat to flight safety and the po impact of improvement in compliance is no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go the industry must improve its awareness of the to accomplish shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is attain the cultural shift will be much easier if the in shifts as opposed to individual companies taking individual several companies already have chosen to go it alone on this the project accomplished the goals of the document that outlined the terms of flight safety safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight and to consider the safety risk with and ensure that the transfer of risk is there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of the not all envisioned products have been and this is noted in the report as work yet to be done by flight safety background presentation in flight safety international advisory committee was briefed about concerns that often were not being conducted when an unstable approach occurred below the stable approach height the ensuing discussion concluded in agreement that the issue should be studied the eu advisory committee began its own discussion related to the lack of unstable approach policy the risk of the maneuver and what effect air traffic services providers could have on the these discussions led the foundation to look more deeply into the empirical data supporting such failure to conduct is the number one risk factor in approach and landing accidents and the number one cause of runway excursions the year in recent analyses of data from through indicate that percent of all accidents are runway and that they are the most common type of accident the year in unstable approaches occur on to percent of all and to percent of flight crews whose airplanes are in this state continue the approach to landing the year in evidence based in of approach and landing accidents and serious one of several studies conducted by flight safety approach and landing accident reduction task force and published by the foundation in the task force con an analysis of accidents and incidents that occurred from through the task force found that was initiated in only percent of the occurrences and said that the evidence analysts expected the initiation of higher number of in safety foundation alar task approximately percent of all accidents are alas one analysis concluded that more than percent of alas would have been preventable if the crew had decided to go around the year in simply potentially about half of all accidents could be prevented with decision to go no other single de can have such an impact on the overall aviation accident although all of these studies are somewhat the consistencies from study to study indicate the problem is real and is of the magnitude the studies around decision can yield great but what about the risks associated with the maneuver there is no shortage of informative studies that have ana what occurred during alas and what factors contrib to the no known study has examined flight crew decision making from psychological perspective to determine why some crews continued with an unstable knowingly violating company and why th elected to go what are the drivers of intentional noncompliance with critical safety the alar task analysis of approach and landing accidents and serious incidents identified professional decision as the most re casual occurring in percent of the another form of poor decision making or continuing an approach when conditions suggest otherwise accounted for percent of all occurrences safety foundation alar task more questions arise about the or of company management in these if the data have been consistent for many why have managers not been able to correct the with such low industry compliance some basic questions about role need to be are they aware of the noncompliance and if then why have they been unable to mitigate or improve compliance with established if they are not concerned with the poor compliance why man issues were not cited in any of the conclusions of the alar task final of fatal approach and landing in the task conclusions of related study of approach and landing ac and serious management fail was identified as circumstantial factor in percent of the occurrences safety foundation alar task based on these better awareness of the and new flight safety foundation initiated the and execution project it was designed as joint with each committee focusing on one specific aspect of the the focused on decision and the focused on the performance of the decision making flight crew methodology and information collection the presage group was commissioned by flight safety foun to conduct research and analysis on the psychology of factors contributing to intentional the basis for much of the following comes from two studies conducted by presage one that analyzed the psychology of flight crew decision making during unstable and another that analyzed the psychology of company management decision making pertaining to addressing noncompliance with com safety policies jamieson and why are policies the ology of de making during unstable jamieson and why are policies the view from the airline although the issue extends beyond unstable the studies were conducted on this phase of flight as data were readily attainable from flight psychological survey was developed that used unique questioning and experimental methodologies to understand the causation of compliant versus noncompliant flight crew decision these techniques included assess experiences using series of questions designed to explore the psychological precursors of risk assessment and decision second survey was designed to assess the beliefs and experiences of airline ag and safety and operational personnel regarding unstable approaches and how they are managed at their host to fully understand the systemic roots and dynamics of noncompliance with unstable approach policies across the the results of the managers study were compared with those of the parallel flight crew flight crew event recall study segmentation in this segment of the we asked pilots to recall recent specific instances of unstable at or below sah we asked for the last instance they had this special task elicited detailed descriptions of their experiences during the minutes leading up to and including decision on whether to call for these

also reported variety of basic demographic information time on base of and flight operational characteristics haul versus short haul aircraft the content of the entire survey was thoroughly commented upon and amended in accordance with the recommendations made by members of the and and other expert advisory team the pilots were divided into those who only experienced continuing to land with an unstable approach those who only experienced those who had experienced both and unstable approach pilots in this group were randomly as to one of two groups to recall scenario in which they had flown an unstable approach but did not call for or to recall this random experimental assignment allowed us to identify objective and psychological situational factors associated with noncompliance with policies re decision pilots who reported they had only flown or an unstable approach recently in the last five recalled their last event of those respective the main set of psychological and

pilot thresholds study segmentation second experiment was included in this and we report some findings but the details are too mer to fully describe this experiment was designed to uncover the environmental and physical instability param that influence perceptions of the risks inherent in flying unstable and to examine when their attention to these parameters affects their judgments about when to call for in this pilots were pre with hypothetical flight scenario in which they were randomly assigned to receive variations in the severity of the risk associated with wind runway braking action and runway they were then asked at what degree of on five different flight those variations would cause them to call for pilots were instructed to report on their likelihood of calling for based on their own personal risk not those of their companies or of the on this set of five flight and to do so at different this allowed us to infer where on the flight path different risk factors become personally salient and important as drivers of judgments to go and how these factors might the objective was to determine whether there was basic alignment between about when there is need to call for and general policies about when these instabilities necessitate such in case of evidence of any gaps between these our goal was to use these data to guide realistic recommendations about changes in policy that might bring them into alignment while ensuring that safety would not be to the extent that pilots do not see current policies as constituting set of legitimately unsafe they are likely to ignore such standard procedures and engage in potentially pli flight this was an experimentally based attempt to explore pilot perceptions of what should constitute the conditions to go in their experienced and to begin to develop view about whether such beliefs could be or should be incorporated into policy guidance and sops in way that would help ensure safe pilot respondent sampling respondents to this survey were solicited through direct communication with safety personnel at various pilot and and airlines as well as through various social media the goal was to invite and administer the online survey to as many pilots as possible from around the representing variety of flight respondent experience physical and so anonym was assured to inspire honest and complete of as

of the presage group for flight safety foundation suggesting our results can be generalized to pilots world management study in this we asked safety managers at major airlines those with the authority to recommend or enact changes in unstable approach criteria and as well as those responsible for quality control of flight op series of questions regarding their views of the safety procedures and organizational cultures with which unstable approaches and occur in their own airline we asked such managers about the rates of compliance with unstable approach policies that they believed their airlines as well as the compliance rates experienced by the commercial industry as beyond this basic we asked whether they were satisfied with their performance on li with their unstable policies and and whether they thought them about their perceptions of the clarity and appropriateness of these policies and about their beliefs that they had the support support and organizational to manage their and about their overall assessment of how urgently they believed that the risks perceived in their rates needed to be addressed at the content of the entire survey was thoroughly commented upon and

foundation flight irrespective of whether their role included policy development or the considerable efforts that we made in our outreach and engagement strategy for the survey garnered unique visits to the survey we consider this number of hits to be very indicating that the engagement strategy drove meaningful number of airline managers to the of those only completed the response rate low in both absolute and relative to the rate of participation among pilots who were asked to complete much longer and more demanding this low response rate we the first evidence pointing toward disengagement with the topic of unstable policy and procedures among airline flight operations personnel at the managerial this is especially true when we consider that the original criterion for inclusion in our final analysis stipulated that respondents must be in position to develop and influence unstable policies and procedures at their airlines by virtue of their authority to recommend or make based on this inclusion criterion and an analysis of reported roles and we achieved sample of only qualified spon to increase the sample size for we widened the sample frame to include those respondents responsible for quality control of flight operations at their even if they did not have policy development thorough comparison of the latter group with the original target revealed no systematic differences in their survey justifying their inclusion in the final the reports the results from managers per of all survey respondents and percent of survey site this low response rate essen disallowed us from analyzing data for experimental task of determining personal around thresholds for unstable approach risk among similar to the threshold in light of the low response caveat must be issued for all other results that we report that is because the normative response to the survey invitation among managers worldwide was to choose not to we must question whether this was valid and reliable sample of that the although based on this small are highly suggestive of trends in perspectives on unstable policies and while we are unsure if the sample in our intuition tells us that any sample if would tend toward having surveyed managers who are more aware and concerned about the issue than those who are less if this is these results may more likely the degree of awareness and concern about unstable around noncompliance that exists in the industry sensing throughout the there have been numerous dis with manufacturers and and conference and meeting with accounts from agencies not wishing to be identified indicate of those that have tracked rates are in the range of those discussed above to and that they have been in that range for protracted period of the exceptions are couple of airlines that indicated their around compliance rates approach they say that their flight data acquisition programs are set to report out when the number of stable approach parameter is greater than the federal aviation aviation safety information analysis and sharing operational quality assurance definition says an unstable ap occurs when more than two parameters are exceeded between ft above ground level and ft or below ft mitre most unstable policies require when one or more parameters are the conversation begins with policy non and expands to include

foundation factors that would otherwise be con with their into recall event condition or unstable because they had recently experienced only that one type of findings from comparison of these groups are and represent situationally important factors associated with decision not pilot dispositional pilot tendencies and preferences associated with flying unstable approaches of present in the aviation and we will also point out in the data how such pilot sposi factors may additionally contribute to noncompliance with it is our belief that the best way to present the findings is to describe how noncompliant behavior is function of process influenced by the aircraft and environmental factors that shape their situational awareness competencies in encoding and inter the cues they receive about these aircraft and their personal perceptions of risk and risk tolerance that and their appetite for appropriate col conversation about risk during the approach as an input to decision it is from both the responses within each of these four classes of as well as the interactions between the two that complete scrip psychological profile for noncompliance pilot situational awareness profile situational awareness of his or her in all its is the psychological prerequisite for pilot to judge risk and then to make decision to maintain compliance and safety in light of that this study used the situational awareness model for measuring and interpreting the psychological and social factors that col make up situational recall that within this situational awareness comprises nine distinct but interconnected and seamless aspects of much of our discussion will be framed around how each of these aspects influences singly and in concert with one to remain compliant rather than note in passing that the presage model classifies with an average percent accuracy whether pilots are describing an unstable approach and landing or percent for unstable approaches and percent for based only on its psychosocial measurements and excluding any knowledge of the objective factors present in the unstable approach scenarios this means that our assessment of the experience of aware as we have measured does good job of predicting behavior far beyond percent chance level of the results of this study as that on all nine situational awareness unstable approach pilots were significantly less aware than pilots in the moments leading up to and including their around decision making that they were less aware of their emotional responses to less able to anticipate more overconfident in their ability to compensate for the and in less agreement with company in other the unstable pilots scored much lower than did the pilots on every facet of situational awareness seven of these nine differ held up statistically to the more rigorous analysis that compared just the experimentally assigned and un approach pilots with one and eight of the nine differences between the experimentally assigned and unstable approach pilots were even more pronounced when comparing the and it is meaningful to does this awareness shape perception of put situational awareness competencies directly affect his or her perceptions and assessment of the lower the degree of threat that pilots associate with instability and environmental factors the perception of which is directly informed by their situ awareness the lower the significance that pilots will place on the contributing factors and the less risky they will perceive the situation to table shows this with unstable pilots reporting much lower assess of the riskiness and unmanageability of their bili than the spreading activation effect of situational awareness competencies we have asserted that the nature of the facets of situational awareness means that decline in one facet will produce rapid deleterious effect on the this becomes clear when we consider the data relevant to this activation of situational awareness for this effect is evident among the unstable approach pilot whose lower scores on their gut feel for threats as well as on actually seeing the leave them vulnerable to minimizing both their assessment of the potential threat of aircraft instability and their ability to see the threat of instability as risk to be managed the natural outcome is that more unstable approach pilots are unstable at sah corollary of these lower aware scores is that unstable approach pilots also score lower in their ability to leverage crew relationships to maximize compliance and table shows that unstable approach pilots are more likely to minimize efforts to consider discuss with their members both instability factors path aircraft ref sink rate and land and environmental factors contaminated runway and occupied it is the culminating effect of the aforementioned reduced awareness competencies that leaves the unstable approach pilots vulnerable to adopting mental model that minimizes the risk of instability and reduces their attention to as the results for the instruments and and the indicate functional and hierarchical in table unstable approach pilots are more tolerant of deviations from operational limits and procedures and less compliant with requirements that they perform all checklists and standard as these pilots commit to continuing with an unstable they minimize what their professional experience could offer in executing what the sop states table note on or critical in other when an unstable approach pilot is not tuned into salient from his or her experience he increases the risk profile of the operation and denies himself the opportunity to correctly adjust or compensate for the operational threat table to or compensatory the finding that unstable approach pilots more often than pilots report being unstable at sah confirms this missed opportunity to remain compliant in concert with the former pattern is the finding that unstable approach pilots were more comfortable operating on the margins of the safety envelope in table note the lower scores on the or empirical which translates to greater tolerance for risk that is seen to be in table note the assessment of the instability as if pilot is paying less attention to his situational awareness he would likely also shut himself off from avail such as by using interpersonal relationships to protect operational safety and remain compliant table note each other or relational there are number of significant findings at the level of this construct that tell meaningful most notable among these is that unstable approach pilots are relatively more likely than pilots to feel crew to to perceive lack of crew support for possible to feel discomfort in being challenged and in challenging and to feel inhibited about calling for because of the authority structure in the pilots are about four times more likely than unstable approach pilots percent to report recalling that an individual was prompting the crew to initiate ref is reference landing speed the evidence is clear that rather than leveraging the crew relationships as tool for safe decision crew expectations and communication had even compounding this risk profile are the findings that unstable approach pilots score lower on support for and that fewer than percent of unstable pilots believed they would be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to land at the same maintaining that their criteria for when to execute are not realistic in the for the unstable approach there is less to company and an incentive structure that or is at least not seen to unstable approaches that are continued to these results describe situation that creates internal conflict for the unstable approach at least in when they express regret for their decision to continue an unstable approach to landing compared with unstable approach pilots rated their flight outcomes less believed less often that they had made the right believed much more strongly than pilots that they should not have made the decisions they did agreed more strongly that they had engaged in needless interpretation of results the results appear to imply conflicting message from the unstable approach pilot on one unstable ap pilots regret their decisions to continue an unstable approach and knowing that they have taken and at the same they believe that the criteria for are realistic the latter may in rationalization of their noncompliant and one that they carry forward into the next such unstable approach at the moment of the potential for noncompliant behavior based on these beliefs is very while the chance seems remote that pilots may anticipate regret for not calling for and may have that anticipation inhibit their tendency to continue the unstable consider the psychosocial factors affecting unstable ap pilots at the time they need to make an appropriate decision on whether to go they have lowered sense of situational awareness across most which has led them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their assessment of their process re little help from protective crew norms and and there is no real disincentive to fly unstable the expected company response to that these are the ingredients of recipe for the of to contaminate this component of aviation safety this term refers to the development of mode of which is passively support tolerated approved by its owners and in some regula once entrenched within given this new power and authority can considerably influence as evidenced in the challenger and columbia space shuttle tragedies supportive evidence from the results of this study indicates that in their acceptance of the noncom unstable approach pilots have surrendered level of situational awareness competency that directly impacts accurate risk assessment and full compliance with sops as in new roles and incentives have come to displace some of the influence that situational awareness should have in proximity to risk assessment and decision pilot thresholds for going around another area for discussion is the second experimental part of the which asked pilots to describe their risk toler thresholds for various given set of flight and environmental we found that braking action had particularly large impact on pi perception of the degrees of instability that warrant call for on the thresholds for calling for varied as function of both height agl and the instability parameter they were considering as reason for going for several of these instability fac the perceived threshold occurred well below ft agl to in pilots

the pilots is warranted to fully explain the he of broad noncompliance with policies and the inherent risks associated with the percent of unstable approaches that continue unstable can only be indirectly inferred from the present based on pilot this study mainly assessed the logi characteristics and in situ of pilots who choose to continue unstable approaches to landing versus those who make decisions to go the study does not segregate the various unstable approach scenarios into classes of presenting high or low objective while it is understood that not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent the percent of unstable approaches that are flown to completion include the ap and these can result in in the absence of definition of the objective level of risk associated with given pilots have only one set of one definition of the instabilities and environmental threats that are expected to trigger beyond this single it is up to the pilot to further determine pilot

and manageable level of this determination flows directly from his level and type of situational awareness and the mental models of risk he constructs based on that to the extent that pilot has lowered situational awareness whether caused by acute aspects of the situation such as high workload or chronic aspects of the cultural environment such as lessened acceptance of the policy guidance or generally few challenges to cockpit command he will be less sensitive to relevant situational awareness cues and therefore be more likely to continue an unstable approach irrespective of the inherent objective risks associated with the these inadequately informed mental models of risk less accurately and sensitively represent the objective levels of the present as they will not track re

trigger single set of criteria is often insufficient to cover all as tony an psychologist and author of several books on human has guidance is ef when it is thought out and written explained commonly understood and voluntarily complied too many rules lead to cynicism and because not all situations can be rules cannot be developed to cover all possible in these the human ability to adapt to changing situations is just as important as the implementation of effective policies and need to reach point where two types of professional discipline become kern first is the organizational discipline to keep the rules to an absolute minimum and enforce the rules across the the second is the personal discipline to comply company too he policies and procedures conflict with cultural and when that who studies noncompliance knows that culture will nearly always trump at least in the long not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent and based on the different objective environments from approach to there can be conflict between these and the singular prescriptive company as in by the disagreement with company policy once pilot is outside the prescriptive box of policy and has made the decision to continue the he is left to his individual risk assessment whatever that may to determine his personal risk thresh without robust prescriptive policies that allow for some open analysis of risk and decision making can offer solution to these cases in which the objective and stated policies do not align for if policy says that flight crew must go around in all cases if the aircraft has not touched down within seven seconds of crossing the the pilots likely would view the importance of that policy dif depending on the conditions of the they would likely be more in agreement with the policy for an approach to shorter runway that was contaminated and had slight tail wind than for an approach to dry runway with slight head if the policy is written to allow some from the under some guiding pilots will agree with the policy more in this example of the short contaminated the briefing should include statement that there would be no modification of the whereas in the case of the long the briefing may include an allowance to increase that frame to it is important to em that these allowances should follow guided process laid out by the and that the policies remain mi in this guiding principles may be that all members agree in advance of the and that the landing distance available exceeds the landing distance required by predetermined allowing some guided decision pilots will be more likely to trust and voluntarily comply with written in part because those policies will address the highly variable environments in which pilots work and also because the pilots will recognize that their expertise and knowledge are being used in the an increased agree on policy leads to increased and to the normalization of stable approach and decision points it is also worth discussing the relationship between the stable approach the sah safe landing guidelines and decision as the decision to go around remains possible up until the point of deploy and policies usually indicate that should be initiated any time an aircraft becomes unstable below the then it follows that the decision point to go around defines the beginning of zone in which is mandatory if the approach is thrust reverser deployment defines the end of that most sop channel flight crews to specific decision points to determine if they are in state in which it is safe to continue the these points are before deploy these sop callout points are usually linked with leaving no formal stable for an extended period of time when is active calls selection of calls that are mandatory for all varying objective force communication between or conditional on the other are only communicated if stimulated by the weakness in the passive call process is if call is not it could be for reasons other than the required objective condition being for if member did not see the call would not be in member might choose not to make call for varying such as subjective interpretation of the condition or fear of the cockpit authority active calls are always as they force their absence indicates another such as pilot many responsive by the pilot flying at sah or minimum approach height suggest what will what they are going to do for example suggestive calls like to influence the decision to land and close the window for the decision to go even though may be required if the flight becomes unstable very late in the approach or repeated and escalated calls allow condition to remain alive in the conscious mind of the on the other single callout for example at sah raises situational awareness about the condition at that as situational awareness is it can change improving or and that are designed to continue as long as the condition exists help to maintain awareness of that escalation of the calls can heighten take the example of from enhanced ground proximity warning systems and other terrain awareness and warning systems the system alerts the flight crew to pending condition and continues with until the condition is no longer the same effect can be com in unstable approach by both members and automated as the onset of approach instabilities can occur at any even late in the landing phase keys to safe the window for decision that the deci is not made at defined point at the the decision points for are separate and distinct from the stable approach and as procedure designers can separate the two to maximize decision in reviewing the fsf alar task force elements of stabilized safety foundation alar task we discover somewhat conflicting mes it states that approaches in instrument meteorological conditions must be stabilized before reaching ft visual meteorological conditions they must be stabilized before ft agl in precision and visual approaches on the other the document indicates that descent below ft is acceptable in maneuver for circling and specifies that should be level on final when the aircraft reaches ft above airport in other on precision guided the documented guidance is that the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl in and on circling guided the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet it is not difficult for pilot to conclude if it is acceptable and safe to fly off final approach profile until ft agl on then it is also safe to fly an approach to ft off although that by objective objective is that which does not require an individual to interpret information based on his or her ex or it is usually factual objective feedback in the cockpit minimizes the need for interpretation and can lead to more consistent and faster decision stating fact instead of interpreting making judgment or forming an opinion helps mini the effect of steep authority gradient in the such as may exist when first officer is paired with an example of objective feedback is that by an automated system such as in this there is little subjective analysis done by the pilot when re to automated and the response can be quick and this in why an automated energy approach monitoring and alerting can be very effective in improving another example of the use of objective feedback is the use of radio altimeter automatic rather than interpreting radio altimeter readout readouts can fluctuate due to terrain and must be observed and on the other are only in the absence of an automated energy management after pilots cross the they usually subjectively or how much runway has passed or how much from they decide whether to conduct if the pilot monitoring times the threshold crossing and then makes procedural call at the point where touchdown should occur or should this call constitutes objective feedback to the pilot flying and makes clear that some either touchdown or should occur should have driven by policy and minimizing subjectivity in pro is an objective that procedural designers should make every effort to management decision making overview of results in table we present data for of their awareness if their specific estimates both the and their own rates of compliance with unstable when asked whether they knew what the compliance rate only percent of managers said that they of those who claimed fewer were willing to estimate managers percent of the offered an estimated which averaged percent compliance times the true and was highly variable percent to standard only one in seven managers reported rate that was considered percent of the actual percent the perception of rates may not be the central concern of managers working to police their own noncompliance with unstable but this general lack of awareness and accuracy in estimating the true even among those claiming cannot be when asked whether they knew what their own compliance rate percent of managers said that they although only percent offered an estimate of that majority of managers are largely unaware of unstable compliance and noncompliance even within their own of the managers who offered the mean rate was percent again with large range to and standard de these managers are estimating li rates at their companies that on more than percent above the industry average as they perceive it if their estimates were they would indicate that the companies were outperforming the indus as whole by more than tenfold percent what is most striking is the tremendous degree of variability in the revealing that there is very little common basis of even among those claiming knowledge of the rates at their own in our it is highly unlikely that this is an objective for perceptions to have truly tracked with these data would mean that companies are ex the full range of compliance from zero to it is hard to imagine that this is the and hard to imagine how this could result in an average that hovers at percent

operations compliance rates in answer to the prior one in eight managers reported compliance rates broadly in line with the industry average less than at the opposite end of the percent re rates above the mean rate was again with wide range and variability to with standard deviation of that such spread of compliance rates is reported by this sample is we believe it reflects not only general lack of awareness among managers of the rates of compliance with their own policies strongly indicated by the incidence of but perhaps also specific errors within their although objective data are this assertion can only be by again assuming that compliance rates exceeding percent are rare in the we cannot rule this out because although we have access to we lack objective verification of company compliance if the rates are it suggests that our sample is drawn from an unusually compliant subsample of in that the lack of awareness effects across the manager study suggests that awareness could be less than we begin with some overall observations about the data in table on each of the three the norma response is to not and only minority of ag claim to or rate of as managers and compliance rates for their own companies more frequently than they do for the industry as probably because they are less familiar with their perception of the compliance is out of line with six times greater than the actual percent rate of managers tell us as an aggregate sample that they believe their companies are outperforming the rate of compliance by to on this is the equivalent of compliance rate at least times greater than the as if we assume that these com have more realistic unstable policy compliance rate below percent rate span still up to three times better than the current industry this would mean that only about one in seven managers to in the survey reported an accurate rate for their own whether their reporting was based on personal estimate or on their fda if we give them more and allow that their companies actually achieved rates upward of then high accuracy of rates of report is still shared by fewer than of the seven in simply do not know their own or if they do they their compliance rates by more than these kinds of perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence and complacency about unstable policy manager situational awareness profile manager perceptual measures of situational awareness managers completed questions to assess their beliefs and behaviors concerning their rates and unstable the results are in table the responses were subjected to an empirical factor analysis to determine how they merged in minds and to provide simpler summary categories for presentation and three of the four factors to emerge had more than one associated one factor was assessment of whether the respondent debriefed flight crew who had violated the com unstable factor theme was the perceived support that the spon received from their companies in understanding and managing the six questions this factor com were averaged and called factor comprised questions assessing the degree to which managers thought that their unstable policies and procedures and their associated operational definitions were clear and responses to five questions were averaged to create an index of factor was an expression of ag concerns about and sense of urgency surrounding their it was formulated by averaging responses to the five questions shown in table and named in addition to the four we present overall measures recorded by managers of their

that all flight crews are high absolute number of managers who admit to less than complete debriefing while this may seem like high the fact that the statement was phrased as as opposed to company may account for the to examine the relationships between positive perceptions of organizational compliance fac and low concern with their we studied responses from only those managers who had reported on their compliance rates that of all those claiming knowledge of this we divided them into managers whose reports were generally close to the industry average of accept anyone who reported rate of less than percent into group we labeled reporting what looked like reasonably accurate compared with the industry base all other managers reported compliance rates from to percent and were placed in comparison group labeled reporting compliance rate not likely to be the results show that stating an rate of li is at significant statistical with higher scores on two of the five questions on the second factor of per the effectiveness index as and the single measure of effectiveness effective it is also correlated with lower scores on the perceived threat index and four of its five component while this pattern may seem obvious in it makes the point independent of the level of support perceived for ag rates were no differences on the perceived support the perception of the policies as effective and the threat as low may flow from basic lack of realistic knowledge or appraisal of the compliance if this causal effect is true that posi perceptions lead to low perceived threat then what is clearly indicated by these data is the need for raising about the industry norm of massive and dissemination of the own data identifying their internal rates of unstable around policy compliance and segmentation analysis to determine whether the sample included types of ag whose views of their compliance rate and performance were consistent with each other and also different from other identified we conducted traditional cluster analysis on this sample of managers agglomerative cluster based on euclidean due to the small sample we generated just two groups to and based the mathematics of this segmentation on variety of responses given in the this of consisted of the perception questions and the two overall measures of effectiveness and satisfaction all the measures presented in table not the resulting groups consisted of one whose members perceived high risk in their compliance rates risk and second group whose members had more moderate view risk the percent of ag who perceived high risk differed from the percent of perceivers on almost all measures in the and powerfully in both the statistical sense and the magnitude sense degree of statistical table shows that on of and on all three the high risk perceiver group showed pattern of higher concern and perceived lower satisfaction with their lower perceived policy and compliance presage situational

realistic and appropriately anxious and concerned about their low rates of but who perhaps have little voice or power within the company to change policy or procedures they see as more likely to be or to offer new definition of what should constitute stable approach they see as overly how did these managers score on the presage indices of situational this situation presents clear instance of via of most policies and procedures surrounding unstable performance rates and their manage as our metrics are likely to show low absolute on scale of to with corresponding to high safety the first column of table which displays these scores for the overall shows this to be the in no case does the absolute score on any of our awareness metrics exceed the midscale of safety awareness is low in all of the awareness areas assessed by our we know in this instance that unstable noncompliance is major problem for the our measures of situational awareness are scored higher when this problem is recognized to be in the ap to scoring shown in table all measures are scored such that higher numbers indicate greater degree of realistic threat awareness and as higher situational awareness on our measures is associated with seeing the cur threat to be real anticipatory and the procedural measures used to compensate for it to be ad adjusting to the managers with higher situational awareness see their current procedures as re and the definitions of instability as too narrow scores on knowing the procedures and knowing the their experience high reliance on peri tells them there is and they feel more anxious and eager to take action against this safety threat gut feeling for because new plan is needed in the face of general lack of appreciation of the threat to compliance in their higher awareness is also associated with perception that their companies have little will to and are generally complacent about the sops in place to manage the threat relational and corporate support for as those with higher awareness also feel less support from and higher level of discomfort in approaching senior management to broach the with this understanding of our scoring methods in we examined the scores of the two groups the managers who reported compliance rate based on their fda that was than versus those who the compliance rate percent or we hypoth sized that more accurate awareness of the low rate of compliance would be associated with heightened sense of perceived threat and the felt need to com all aspects of the situational awareness we that managers who were aware of the actual low rate of compliance with unstable around policies at their airlines would receive higher scores on all nine of our metrics than their colleagues who were even if the magnitude of these scores was still low in absolute terms when compared to the scale in table it can be seen that on seven of our nine metrics of situational the hypothesis that the respondents would report greater situational awareness was supported at level of statistical reliability of percent or that if this experiment were repeated we would observe the same differences in of the only on the and each other were the levels of awareness similar for the two albeit at low absolute in those aware of the low compliance rates at their companies scored at or above the midscale on five of our metrics fec anticipatory and if minimum midscale threshold of situational awareness across majority of our measures was enough to trigger some the individuals in this group were close to reaching such trigger how note that this group constituted just percent of of our sample small minority coming to full aware of the table also shows results derived from cluster analysis on the presage metrics for the two groups those perceiving relatively high risk in their unstable around policies and rates percent of and those not generally perceiving such risks will be recalled these groups were designed for all managers in the irrespective of whether they claimed to or ventured to what their company compliance rate actually according to fda or in this all nine awareness factors are statistically reliably with five means above the midscale for the perception these results are more encouraging in terms of the complement of managers perhaps ready to act in this important area of as about of the sample shows signs of having reached threshold of aware that will trigger activity to manage this issue more safely in the near as demonstration of the effect that improved awareness in one area can have on overall situational we compared the situational awareness scores of all managers with the scores of the group whose members were aware of their internal company compliance rates figure shows the incremental benefit that awareness in one area can have across eight of the nine it is relevant to discuss the approach to monitoring unstable approach flight as many flight data monitoring programs are set to report only when more than one stable approach criterion is and in some to report only low level alert until three or more criteria are we see an indication from those responsible for the design of these programs that there is an acknowledged variability in the risk of unstable more there is an indication of on between the level of concern for low risk unstable approaches and the policy guidance for flight crews on those same which is to execute when one or more criteria are from the spec of the flight why should they be concerned about the risk of this level of unstable approaches if management is not concerned enough to want to be told about them or act on situational awareness of managers who knew company compliance rules feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures additional base score the presage group for flight safety foundation this is consistent with the results of both the pilot and management psychological industry sensing the conversation about reducing the risk of alas often drifts toward how to eliminate unstable even though the discussion begins with focus on rates of compliance with it is clear that there is larger with the existence of unstable despite the fact that the industry has reduced unstable approaches to percent or in an industry with such variable objective one must ask is the lowest attainable unstable approach it makes sense that an industry with almost nonexistent compliance with policies would be concerned about the small number of unstable approaches that if we turn the tables and consider for moment an industry with high rate of policy would there be as much concern about unstable and is the focus on eliminating unstable approaches the right strategy in reducing in flight safety year study of runway conducted in we see that percent of the landing excursions were las as and of percent followed stable approach that became unstable during the landing only percent of the landing excursions followed unstable overruns accounted for the other percent of landing percent of overruns followed stable and percent followed unstable in percent of landing runway excursions followed stable and an number per followed unstable separate analysis by boeing of runway overrun excursions from to found that percent followed stable and drawing from concentrated effort to reduce figure overall manager situational awareness scores feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures the presage group for flight safety foundation number of unstable approaches that become unstable in the approach phase will address less than half of all landing on the other reliable making operation has the potential to affect most landing ex those occurring after flights that become unstable during the approach or landing strategy to continue improving the stable approach rate in addition to improving the compliance rate is the most com the point of this discussion is to illustrate that the tendency to focus only on eliminating unstable approaches will not address large portion of and that improving the compliance rate holds the greater in an fsf runway safety initiative determined that gap existed in alar tool kit risk reduction which did not address the landing phase the foundation then developed

finding unstable approach in feel regret about continuing an unstable approach more strongly than pilots regret going and feel less positive about the outcomes of their mp finding unstable approach pilots have lower sense of situational awareness across most which leads them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their risk finding pilot norms and processes for continuing unstable approaches provide little foundation for compliant decision making the action is to not go around when mp finding roles and incentives have displaced some influence that good situational awareness should have in risk assessment and decision finding pilots who believe that their criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also on that the threshold for the aircraft to be on profile and in proper configuration is below ft closer to to ft mp finding pilots who believe that their criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic also on that they can compensate for energy management until the aircraft descends to ft and under certain below mm finding at the managerial there are indications of general disengagement with the topic of policy and mm finding among there is general lack of awareness of rates of policy finding among there is general lack of awareness of their own company rates of policy finding among managers who have objective noncompliance rate such as flight understanding of the compliance rate is likely mm finding managers who claim to know the company around compliance rate are likely to overstate the compliance rate by over these perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence about mm finding managers perceive moderate degree of fec of their policies and mm finding managers perceive less than moderate level of support within their company for managing li mm finding managers slightly disagree overall that there is concern or need action to improve their compliance mm finding the managers with better understanding of compliance rates for both the industry and their own the high risk perceiver were more realistic and concerned about their low compliance but perhaps have little voice or authority within the company to change policy or mm finding managers who scored higher on the situational awareness measure associated with seeing the current threat as real also scored lower in relative terms on the measure used to compensate correctly for the risk suggesting the presence of with respect to effectively managing this mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores see their current procedures as being unrealistic and definitions of instabilities as being too mm finding managers with higher situational awareness scores had the perception that their companies have little will to change and are generally complacent about sops for managing mm finding managers with higher awareness of their compliance rates also feel less support from senior managers and higher level of discomfort with ap them about the mm finding managers who were aware of low compliance rates in their companies scored at or above the midscale on anticipatory and compensatory situational awareness this is minority consisting of percent of mm finding the tendency is to lean toward the single focus of improving the unstable approach rate as the best way to prevent even though empirical data indicate finding safe landing guidelines published by flight safety foundation to address an identified gap in the alar tool kit risk reduction is not well known by operators and not documented in operations strategies for corrective decision making we conclude that there are three categories that can be defined in achieving an effective policy from logi the policy should make sense operationally for most environmental conditions encountered for the people executing the policy and those managing the policy operations and should be acceptable to those externally effected by the application of the policy traffic the policy must be managed effectively by the management this is important not only because of the need to achieve objectives set out by senior management but also because those ut the policy need to see and understand that the policy is being managed management over of the policy is awareness of the policy guidance and the risks associated with not executing the policy must be high for both flight crews and the following is list of recommended making strategies to mitigate dm strategy ensure the policy makes sense update the stable approach definition and sah to maximize their relevance to flight crews and their separate the stable approach definition and criteria from criteria and points to improve awareness that these are two distinct aspects of and that decision making continues beyond the approach this does not imply that they cannot meet at points throughout the approach and it is intended for the sop and communication designers to separate the psychological attachment of these two dm strategy manage the policy operators set specific compliance rate targets for and establish initiatives to achieve authorities amend industry and regulatory audit pro to include standards and recommended practices that address dm strategy increase increase awareness of noncompliance and risks associated with continuing to land when and awareness of the significant impact that pli has on operator flight industry and pilot enhance situational awareness to heighten flight awareness throughout the ap and and landing policy and procedural communication minimize the subjectivity of decision making for the decision maker pf or as per com to mitigate those components of situational awareness that compromise the risk assessment and for by installing stable approach monitoring decision making the following are recommendations for corrective action to mitigate noncompliance and execution each recommendation supports previously identified dm recommendation manufacturers should continue develop of and operators should install stable approach and energy management monitoring and alerting dm recommendation operators should understand their own respective compliance dm recommendation operators should establish internal around compliance rate targets and dm recommendation where flight crew ia and operator management should establish or process in which fda can be used to assist in effectively managing compliance dm recommendation operators and the industry should the stable approach criteria and sah to better align policies with manageable and operational safe

is may transfer risk to maneuver distinguish between profile criteria and energy management criteria and decision point which could have distinct and separate allow for variable objective not all environ create the same risk high tail winds and contaminated runways statistically create the the stable approach although mostly should allow an element of guided decision making that is corroborated between dm recommendation operators should establish and publish safe landing guidelines in operations keys to safe and see appendix revised safe landing for industry dm recommendation operators should develop procedures to be performed during every approach that describes the state of stability and the intention of the decision based on company effective elements of these communications the state of stability is made by the member not responsible for the decision to go around the pm or the first per company this creates shared responsibility for activity in the communication procedures are not passive or conditional call is made at the assigned point during every this forces communication procedures should be objective they should state facts about the this minimizes authority gradients within the communication procedures should be sequential and esca late if the condition is not corrected to within ac calls continue and escalate to defined point at which new directive call is for if an call at ft agl does not result in successful corrective the calls continue every ft until the condition is corrected or critical point is and then directive call is made this maintains continuous situational awareness updating of the similar to warning system active communication should continue well into the ap proach and landing up to the touchdown limit this maintains continuous situational each call should be answered with an ac or call by the decision maker pf or per company the call should not suggest the exclusion of other possible outcomes calling at mini when is an option can have the effect of the window of calling for on the other responding with or assists in keeping decision making dm recommendation operators should apply objective procedures well into the approach and landing including in the touchdown energy management monitoring and alerting systems will minimize the need for dm recommendation operators should create standard descent briefing guidelines that environmental risk instability factors that will result in review of standard decision making in the landing recommendation operators should create standard approach briefing guidelines that update the brief at period just before the approach is dm recommendation operators should understand their spec and flight situational awareness levels and psychological profiles for managing internal dm recommendation operators should provide training to enhance psychosocial awareness and and how they contribute to noncompliant decision dm recommendation operators should ensure no fault around policies are implemented and understood by management and flight dm recommendation operators should ensure that un approach and policies are concise and am including procedures and expectations for recommendation operators should communicate indus rates and internal compliance targets and goals of performance to flight crews and the ag involved in achieving operators also should mmu the potential that improved performance could have on the overall risk dm recommendation state and industry audit such as the iata operational safety audit should establish compliance standards and recommended practices for operators to manage dm recommendation state and industry safety organizations such as those associated with the international civil aviation organization the european aviation safety the faa commercial aviation safety team should review these recommendations and assess inserting them into their safety dm recommendation the aviation community should annually through global aggregate flight compliance rates for both the approach phase and the landing phase of and communicate the findings to the this role is suited to safety organizations such as flight safety dm recommendation the aviation community should develop and implement an initiative that communicates the compliance and the potential that improved performance could have on the ala rate and the overall accident this is role suited to global associations and safety such as flight safety dm recommendation the aviation community should estab new program to provide method for operators to share effective strategies to improve around compliance the information should be incorporated into an existing dm recommendation the industry should establish an fi for the effect of the phenomenon of noncompliance with as labels such as con flight into terrain or loss of control make it easier for the industry to understand and manage label for this phenomenon will do the and in so will help provide foundation for essential effective utility of each recommendation is and each recommendation addresses different finding or as can be seen in appendix holistic approach to implementing these recommendations will have the best overall and as with any significant program and effects should be closely monitored by an appropriate audit program such as line

effectiveness of monitor during landing and execution the following principal recommendations for safe execution are based on safety forum ex recommendation aircraft operators and atc should im their mutual understanding of each ex recommendation industry partners should develop around training ex recommendation effective monitoring depends on ensuring that pilots with low relevant experience are able to contribute to safe decision making and ex recommendation pilots and their employers should under that one of the many reasons that violating approach minimums is unacceptable is because evidence indicates that if then becomes the chances of safe transition to the are ex recommendation pilots must be able to demonstrate that they are able to safely execute that begin from both high energy and low energy states at the point where around decision is ex recommendation pilots must be able to exercise tactical as well as procedural when deciding to go around below stabilized approach gate so that safe execution is not hindered by an inappropriate delay in decision validation of this must be achieved through realistic training ex recommendation training for pilots should include range of operational including from positions other than and the designated sta approach scenarios should involve realistic simulation of typical landing weights and ex recommendation training for both pilots and controllers should incorporate lessons learned from operational ex recommendation clear guidance should be provided to pilots on how to act in respect to the three stages of monitoring during landing and alerting and taking members of augmented crews who are observing should have clear understanding of the nature of their to effective ex recommendation if an aircraft has the capability to fly automatic pilot training should be provided and the automation policy should address the ex recommendation pilots must have clear understanding of how the pitch control system works on the aircraft type that they this should be validated by both theoretical testing and use of suitable full flight simulator exercises involving approach and with rather than available and at typical landing ex recommendation review should be conducted to deter whether pilots can lose situational awareness of en conflicting traffic during if other pilots are exchanging radio transmissions with atc in languages other than ex recommendation high priority should be accorded to the provision of approach and missed approach ce dures when current procedures involve and when active radar surveillance of the transition to is not consideration should be given to withdrawing procedures at airports where neither option is ex recommendation air navigation service providers should review if enhance the provision of around risk awareness training for ex recommendation ensure that the importance of at stabilized approach and the correct application of final approach procedures is included in training and in briefings for atc staff recommendation implementation training should appropriate speed control timely descent the importance of avoiding late change of runway or change in the type of the importance of assigning landing runway with no significant tail wind the need to avoid vectoring too tightly onto final ap and intercepting glide path from the importance of providing the crew with correct information about distance to ex recommendation the agency responsible for instrument approach procedure design should ensure that straightforward procedures are available and published for each these procedures should be designed in consultation with pilots who are representative of those who will be expected to use the which underlie the map for each run as much as be the low below first stop altitude and an early turn in missed approach procedure should be conditional approach procedures xxx but not later than should be the missed approach fix should be located close to the airport to ensure that an aircraft in trouble can be landed immediately on any runway with any chosen by the procedural of the missed approach path from other traffic and from the risk of exposure to wake especially from late should be if both and conventional missed approach ce are then an explicit risk assessment of such availability should be environmental restrictions especially abatement restrictions must not affect the design of missed approach procedures if their imposition would compromise safety ex recommendation on final pilots should be advised of any significant changes in weather runway surface contingency should exist for use in wind shear implementation pilots should receive more relevant and quicker up of information about develop such as changes in wind and runway status quantity of water on the improved information should be provided to crews about tail wind shear and significant wind including reports from preceding runway information should include items such as braking action information about the of standing debris and including reports of technical problems on the and reports of laser ex recommendation guidance should be developed for controllers

is no imperative reason for an if missed approach procedure is to be controllers should detail it when issuing the approach controllers should avoid changes or in except in emergency once pilot has declared or is otherwise known to have begun controllers should avoid unnecessary pilot should inform atc as soon as possible if from the published procedure become ex recommendation sps should consider the feasibility of establishing formal interface between pilots and controllers to explore operational issues and reach an implementation pilots can be invited to attend training and controllers may be able to arrange to observe training days can be provided for pilots to observe operations at atc and it may be possible to organize familiarization flights for pilots and controllers should participate in joint crew resource management in establishing such be aware that it is most unlikely that the pilots participating in such an initiative will be representative of those using the atc services involved and any such bias must be explicitly ex recommendation aircraft manufacturers should ensure that procedures presented in aircraft pilot training and aircraft operating manuals are applicable to that are begun at any stage on final up to and including land that are rejected after ex recommendation safety regulators should review current mandatory training requirements for both pilots and controllers and should ensure that the conclusions of this report are appropriately flight safety foundation future work establish noncompliance industry label such as or fga to go this is to establish easy as has been accomplished with other such as loc or analyze and at global aggregate unstable approaches and unstable landings to determine the level of associated report global compliance performance develop execution and training guidelines for establish industry noncompliance audit standards and recommended practices with organizations such as the international civil aviation organization and in order to minimize the exposure to unnecessary while ensuring further analysis is required to deter the risk balance point between an unstable approach and the foundation should ensure industry partners pursue this promote the distribution and presentation of this report in and encourage republication in complementing publications and safety project conclusion the problem of policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the largest threat to flight safety the potential impact of improvement in compliance is fi no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go the first and foremost change required is that the industry must improve its awareness of the to achieve shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is the cultural shift will be much easier if the industry shifts as opposed to individual companies making changes on their having said several companies are already attacking this issue the project accomplished the goals set forth in the document announcing the fsf safety understand the noncompliance by flight and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight and to consider the safety risk associated with and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of this not

landing speed notes continuing past the related gate should only occur if meeting the objective of the next gate is go if the is not by it could continue if being fully stable by ft is if the call at the respective gate indicates an undesired state or that call should be repeated at an appropriate interval until the condition is repeated every stabilized approach and decision guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind flight safety guidelines for conducting stabilized approaches and achieving reliable decision why the the current fsf guidelines were established in november and updated in analysis revealed that facets of that guidance are not optimal for effective deci making and that they may encourage for approaches involving very low the overall goal is to improve decision in revising the stabilized approach four objectives must be the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and management resulting in greater acceptance of the safety must be ensured during the approach by mitigating against the common types of alas energy hard tail runway excursions it must be ensured that the resulting are con ducted for approaches of appropriate and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to ma increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on the flight collective situational awareness must be improved through better flight crews indicated in the project research that current guidelines on when must be executed are not realistic for most operational environments and they described what realistic parameters look like from their the criteria for which stable approach is defined can be grouped into three types of flight path profile and configuration gear and speed and energy management of speed and add to these the variable environmental conditions length and and and there are four groups of parameters to be considered when designing stable approach approach gates we can address all stable approach parameters and ala safety issues at three procedural agl configuration gate from ft to depending on aircraft agl stable agl the stable approach criteria are the same at each gate for ap conducted in both imc and ft agl configuration gate previous guidance required that must be con if the flight was not fully stable in with respect to the physics of safety is the same in both imc and in this differentiation of at feet in imc and at feet in vmc is not the new functional significance of the mark is that it is the last suitable point along the approach to ensure that final landing configuration is selected and verified by the flight the flap and gear deceleration to final approach speed and thrust stabilization should occur before the aircraft reaches the next gate at ft it should be emphasized that initial configuration should occur before reaching the this gate is the last point at which final landing configuration should be selected and the gate is familiar demarcation to flight crews and is often accompanied by an automatically generated note that the gate may vary for air type and gross the operator should determine the appropriate height of the based on aircraft ra characteristics and the the following discussion of aircraft energy management during approach is based on the fsf alar briefing notes safety aircraft deceleration characteristics although deceleration characteristics largely depend on the aircraft type and gross the following typical values can be considered for quick assessment and management of aircraft deceleration deceleration on glide with landing flaps and gear to kt per glide path is typically equivalent to descent gradient of or vertical for final approach groundspeed of aircraft with final approach speed of kt would need to be at maximum speed of kt at the gate to be stable at using the median deceleration rate of kt per nm and descent rate of nm gate does not address any particular ala type but serves to facilitate achieving fully stabilized approach at the next lower gate it is in line with pilot as seen in experimental data from the that aircraft configuration and aircraft energy management are two separate and distinct aspects of stabilized and the aircraft energy stabilization height can be lower than the aircraft configuration although may be considered at this not mandating at this point reduces the overall number of potential by allowing unstable approaches to continue at safe analysis is discussed in improved collective situational awareness at this gate is achieved through procedural active communication between flight agl gate previous guidance required that must be conduct if the flight was not fully stable in the revised guid retains the recommendation that the approach should be fully stable at this the mandate to go around has been although may be considered at this not mandating reduces the overall number of potential by allowing unstable approaches to con while at safe analysis is found in not mandating at this gate also aligns with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project indicating can still be executed even from lower altitudes when conditions are stable or have only minor deviations outside the stable approach as this makes operational sense to those who execute and manage the there is better likelihood of the gate is suitable point in the approach for flight crew to verify all stable approach it is familiar mar for flight crews and is also often accompanied by an au generated being stable at this point in the approach allows for subsequent developing instabilities to be compared against state of constant energy improved collective situational awareness at this gate is also achieved through procedural active communication between flight ft agl gate this gate is establishing this gate clearly marks the boundary between higher altitudes where stable approach is strongly recommended and the point where continuing an unstable descent reduces the margin of it differentiates between approach stability and these are two distinct flight and from sy they should remain distinct elements in decision it should be understood that the agl value is not intended to be it can be approximated to take ad of aircraft automatic callout for consider an ils minimum set for ft some ac automatic callout systems provide an alert ft above so in such ft agl could be established as the gate value and utilized in the auto callout in the active call descending in an unstable state below the gate should be warning to flight crews that the level of risk is increasing and action is whether the aircraft is unstable at this gate or becomes unstable below analyses indicate that flight crews who continue an unstable descent below ft do not recognize the need for increased concern or the need for the awareness of the increased need for action can be improved by heightening the definition of the from being in an unstable condition to being in condition to go this can prompt the flight crew to make the correct decision to go martin smith of the group psychological tipping point is the moment of maximum situational is when the flight crew is primed to pull the trigger on the the subtle change to to go is such in other the to go is permission to mis to drawing comparison to another industry the pilot not flying is now known as the pm change that was intended to influence the mindset of the pm and also to alter his behavior in recognition of the importance of similar effect can be realized in identifying an unstable flight condition below ft as condition condition that demands to further emphasize the the to win can be viewed as the stable approach zone with the focus on ensuring that the aircraft is fully the area from ft to can be viewed as the primary where the focus shifts from liz the aircraft to going using rejected takeoff below maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action to stop the airplane within the stop as an rejected takeoff below kt is considered to occur in different regime compared with rejected takeoff above through training and there is shift in psychology for pilots operating in the similar shift can be realized through the approach to lowering the execution altitude reduces the overall number of potential by allowing approaches to continue while at alti it makes the stable approach and policies more in line with flight psychological beliefs and more manageable by prevents risk transfer from risk unstable approaches to potentially and limits unnecessary demands on the air traffic if not fully stable at or below this the decision to go around should be made without below ft is not necessarily this determination depends on the degree and type of approach and aircraft type and performance this gate is essentially the beginning of the primary zone from ft to thrust reverser at this the ala is the most common types of low energy alas are landing hard landing and tail if we analyze the most extreme case of low it is one where thrust is at flight speed is ref and the descent rate is fpm double normal rate of federal aviation regulations part the landing the steady gradient climb may not be less than with the engines at the power or thrust that is available eight seconds after initialization of move of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight idle to power design and construction of the engine must enable an increase from the fixed minimum flight idle power from not more than percent of rated takeoff power or thrust available to percent in not less than five the most limiting of these two regulations is the in our extreme case of descending at using linear anal without taking into consideration lessening of the rate of descent as engines and achieving climb the flight will descend ft figure per ft another useful analysis comes from flight safety alar tool kit which says that an aircraft being flown on while on approach with thrust at flight descending at fpm and with ref at minus will experience an altitude loss of approximately ft safety if we more than double the rate of descent to in this the aircraft would ex an altitude loss of approximately feet alar tool figure it is also interesting to look at design specifications for taws such as the technical standard order for such systems requires for the final approach segment warning be given in time to allow for obstacle clear altitude after recovery that includes pilot response time and standard gravitational era of the tso further describes the altitude loss of an aircraft de at with response time of one second and as being and says the required warning should be given no later than ft above the obstacle figure in comparison with these gate of ft agl to execute provides adequate altitude margin for even the most extreme unstable the margin in this case results in percent increase over the linear part percent increase over the fsf alar determination and percent increase over the taws although the number of approach and landing accidents is greater than the number of the around phase of flight has more fatalities per by ensuring safe altitude of ft to conduct in the extreme unstable and by allowing unstable approaches to continue between ft and the potential number of would be lower the exposure to comparisons of revised gates to industry monitoring and alerting and faa runway overrun prevention references the project identified significant benefits in reducing the subjectivity of the analysis by flight the most impactful way to minimize subjectivity is to employ automated systems similar in concept to ws figure altitude loss analysis unstable speed thrust vertical rate fpm

safety foundation tcas to help flight crews make timely and consistent the industry has developed few systems in the form of stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems for approach and landing energy the airbus runway overrun protection system has number of alerting and monitoring but those that are pertinent to this analysis are the visual alert that begins at ft agl and the aural alert at ft does evaluation of aircraft real energy and the runway distance available for and provides visual too alert at ft and an aural alert at ft because of the lower altitudes at which these alerts and considering the severity of the condition that not enough runway to stop the aircraft really is the only except in the most dire when comparing this condition to the conditions being applied to the proposed stabilized approach and the fsf guide are quite honeywell landing system also has many alerting and monitoring including aural alerts beginning at ft agl and ending at ft agl with an the criteria used by the system to make the alert are variable but based on monitoring excessive approach excessive speed and flap settings honeywell the altitudes where these alerts are given are similar to those recommended in the stabilized ap and achieving collective situational awareness through active communication this project found that situational awareness is lacking among most flight crews who continue an unstable descent and land communication is vital in achieving situational two key types of communication are recommended for improvements approach and landing brief and active communication sops throughout the approach and landing and briefings most airlines already have procedures for which ad the most important aspects of the approach and detailed guidance is provided in fsf alar briefing note safety foundation alar task the following guidance is not intended to replace those briefings but is an addition to current standard briefing improve overall ala awareness improve awareness of specific approach and landing as demonstrated in the project simply knowing few overall statistics can raise situational awareness fi when company statistics are they should be in their the following industry statistics can be alas make up approximately percent of all approximately percent of unstable approaches result in more than percent of runway excursions follow stable approach that becomes unstable after threshold reviewing the effects of runway contamination and tail winds on runway excursions is relevant because they contribute to significant number of runway the flight safety runway safety initiative found that about percent of runway landing excursions are of that percent follow stable of all percent were associated with and with runway the remaining per of runway landing excursions are and of that percent follow unstable approaches safety this project found that awareness of instabilities is important in the landing phase as well as in the approach some simple rules of thumb regarding the effect of poor landing technique on landing distance can significantly improve situational for pilots should plan for landing distances to in by ft per second of ft per kt excess speed from ref on dry ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet ft per ft excess above ft over runway this also applies when the vertical guidance for the ap by places the aircraft higher than ft agl when crossing the landing distances are based on threshold briefings including these statistics and rules of thumb should occur at intervals that will ensure that flight crews have an depth awareness of the for example briefings also should discuss any allowances for flight crews to adjust company policies discussion in safe landing as permitted by guided procedures in the policies themselves for allowing crew to conduct touchdown beyond the normal approach and and briefing briefing should in addition to existing approach briefing an emphasis on approach and landing when company statistics should be periodically the briefing should include approach and landing accident overall alas make up approximately percent of all approximately percent of runway excursions develop from approaches that become unstable after threshold approximately percent of unstable approaches or unstable landings result in runway excursion environmental percent of landing excursions are with wind factor in percent and runway nation factor in about percent of follow stable percent of landing excursions are of percent follow unstable landing distance increase rules of ft per second of ft per kt excess speed from ref landing on dry ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet ft per ft excess above ft over runway for each approach briefing should environmental ala threats tail in addition to normal heightened readiness should be discussed in the event of poor environmental any adjustments to approach and landing policy as permitted by written policy guidance landing beyond the normal touchdown zone if performance at an appropriate just prior to commencing the crews should recap current environmental readiness and any adjustments to policy flight safety foundation touchdown zone as long as adequate landing performance and distance references as briefings often occur minutes or more before an the project findings and suggest that short or refreshment of the current threats and be briefed just prior to the ap during period in the lower this can refresh and flight situational approach and and briefing active communication throughout the approach this project determined that communication is one of the key attributes of effective collaborative decision making by flight by factor of approximately flight crews who comply with their policy had uni about approach and for most crews who con an unstable approach and no one made the actual decision to that there was no communication about the decision to it just the difficulty with calls which are made only if prob condition exists is that in their it is undetermined if the condition the call could be absent for several as explained in the report active force flight crews to discuss or express condition either positive or negative on every it is also important not to overload the flight crew with standard communication and to ensure that they have time to listen to atc and perform other active calls must be short and calls are usually initiated by the pm and responded to by the the call on the approach normally indicates and the response by the pf may either be an ac or directional it is recommended that there be an active call at each ap if the active call indicates an undesired aircraft the call should continue to be made periodically throughout the approach at intervals such as each ft or until the desired state is achieved or is this serves the same purpose as warning from ws or repetitive calls in the to zone also pre the pf for an eventual conclusion if the offending ndi is not that repetitive warning calls prime the and relational as compared with common current procedures in which single go call is made at or which has lesser ef in primarily the hierarchical the implementation of active calls should not imply that and communicative calls such as or be passive calls remain an important component of situational awareness and should be used in with active calls as the following are examples of active calls at approach gates during an if an airline has stable approach and monitoring system such as or the need for complete series of active calls throughout the approach and landing is largely these systems apply conditional the nature of the automation provides form of reliability that passive calls from flight crews do gate pm active

available landing as available landing area touchdown aim point touchdown aim point markings are white rectangular one on each side of the runway that begin at the distances indicated the width of the markings varies with the width of the flight safety foundation fsf safe landing guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind the revised flight safety foundation guidelines for safe landing and achieving reliable decision making during the landing as with the stable approach and decision there were several namely that the guidelines make operational sense for both flight crews and manage to improve agreement with the ensure safety during landing by mitigating the common types of landing runway excursions and ensure the resultant are in situations of ap and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to maneuver increases overall and unnecessarily increases demands on improve the flight collective situational the guidelines established here do not replace manufacturer limitations and procedural or state regulations and excursions that occur following an unstable approach are mitigated largely in the approach they can still prevented in the landing large numbers of excursions occur following stable approach that becomes unstable only after the aircraft passes the runway thresh guidelines in this section are targeted at these types of landing excursions are of two in which aircraft run off the end of the runway surface and in which aircraft exit the side of the runway to address these types of we will enhance landing guidelines in four longitudinal limit awareness touchdown zone and lateral limit awareness environmental variability and adjustments to established situational awareness and project findings include that collective situational awareness is low during the landing and although most opera have policies defining where the touchdown should very few have guidance or sops on how to determine where the touchdown or how and when to determine if around should be for most operators spec that the aircraft should touch down in the touchdown zone on the they do not train or specify how to determine if the aircraft has passed the who should make the or how much of deviation from the runway centerline is permissible before should be most pilots say either gut feeling or experience helps them judge when an aircraft has passed the acceptable even though they readily state that their experience does not include from the landing the impact of improving collective situational awareness in the landing phase can be longitudinal limit awareness dz and touchdown zones vary in length with one determining factor being total runway runways of ft and longer have touchdown zones ft long and runways of and longer have touchdown zones long relative positioning markings are present within the dz and are clearly identifiable on the aiming point is the widest marking located at the distance from the threshold and distance from the threshold with the end of the dz being identified by the last marking at ft and approach alerting and monitoring systems such as smart provide aural alerts when an aircraft has passed touchdown when an aircraft passes this area without touching an aural alert such as deep is given honeywell sops then dictate this objective warning immediately enhances crew awareness and leads to better decision in the absence of such the through can be directed to monitor the passing of dz markings and make an active call such as or of after passing the last marking indicating the passage of the in cases in which the runway is contaminated and markings are not couple of options if remaining markers can be using the landing distance of pilots can calculate for an aircraft traveling ft per the normal touchdown area of to ft will occur in four to eight seconds fps seconds to calculations also will show that the end of the dz will pass in approximately seconds fps lateral limit awareness most operators specify that the touchdown shall occur on the runway but do not say how this will hap or who will determine when the aircraft is as important as it is to have situational awareness regarding longitudinal it is equally important to understand lateral manufacturers often provide cockpit visual cues and techniques for determining where the main landing gear is in relation to the aircraft as an boeing says for the the view through lower outboard corner of the forward win to the ground is good visual reference for the outboard side of the main landing gear wheels on the same the lower inboard corner of the forward window is also good reference for the opposite side main gear boeing in the absence of other lateral maintaining the most outboard main landing gears on either side of the centerline is reasonable using visual as in the example can help determine the positioning of the main landing this is considered rough operational guide with its own there are no known alternatives other than relying on the monitor of this positioning can be performed by the pm during the and if he or she sees that the position of the aircraft is he can make an appropriate call in that sops would dictate environmental variability and adjustments to established policies environmental variability can have significant effect on land performance and desired touchdown operators should consider giving flight crews the tools and guidelines to determine when it makes sense to modify or adjust landing and policies for and possibly operational it can be difficult for some operators to consider allowing crew to land beyond the landing combined with sound guidance and policies for operating outside normal makes sense when safe operations are we also have the problem of rules with no room to apply kern said in of these policies begin with good but inside the good we create systems that defy logic and poison the well of which often results in an unintended consequence loss of faith in the system of problems can develop when environmental conditions are such that operating outside established policies makes but there are no guiding principles on how to accomplish for an aircraft landing on run requires landing although the company policy states that should be initiated if touchdown does not occur inside the is it the best course of action as opposed to an option of extending the touchdown point to ft for the answer is if the mark is not if the flight crew can identify this point and if they have briefed the revision to the is it still the best course of action to go in this the transfer of risk to is revised touchdown point can be determined by citing known distance point along the runway taxi runway distance marker or time period one second approximates ft in in another case in which weather and runway conditions demand that touchdown occur before the end of the guid should give crews the methods and means to identify the shorter touchdown for if the crew wants to be touching down within ft of the runway thresh they need references to determine where this will using dz markings or time lapse from the time the aircraft crosses the in any written policies and guidance must be in place to give the flight crew procedures and techniques to modify landing point this should be briefed and agreed upon by all figure approach and landing gates and active end of dz of of deep window window not window not dz touchdown zone calls can be substituted with auto such as flight safety foundation situational awareness and communication figure shows examples of new active calls recommended in the landing phase of in the case of exceeding centerline touchdown it is difficult to define point in the dz where positive centerline active call can be although not in this the use of call may be more that the call is made only when the drift limit is note that stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems

', u' The Missed Approach \\u2013\\nHey Where\\u2019s the Runway?1Missed Approach SegmentA Missed approach is a procedure used when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing\\nThe Missed Approach Segment is that part of an instrument approach procedure between the missed approach point (MAP), the missed approach way-point (MAWP), or the point of arrival at the decision height and the specified missed approach NAVAID (navigational aid), intersection, fix, or waypoint, as appropriate, at the minimum IFR altitude\\nIt is in this part of the approach procedure that the aircraft will climb and return to the en route structure or is positioned for holding or subsequent approach\\nThe missed approach route and altitudes are shown on the instrument approach charts2The Missed ApproachThe missed approach is one of the most difficult and critical phases of an instrument approach and is the one practiced the least\\nHigh workload, as the configuration of the aircraft must be changed (approach to climb out), coupled with new navigation route/Navaids\\nAn approach in actual conditions should be flown with the anticipation that the missed approach is an anticipated outcome\\nThe missed approach procedure typically includes an initial heading or track to follow, and an altitude to climb to.  This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix\\nBe sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach\\nFAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed:\\n1.  Whenever:\\nFlight visibility is less than the specified visibility for the approach\\nIf required visual references are not seen at either of the following times: \\nWhen the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or\\nUpon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DA/DH where a DA/DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that until touchdown.\\n2.  Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References\\nFAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA:\\nThe approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable\\nThe threshold\\nThe threshold markings\\nThe visual approach slope indicator\\nThe threshold lights\\nThe runway end identifier lights (REIL)\\nThe touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings\\nThe touchdown zone lights\\nThe runway or runway markings\\nThe runway lights\\nBasic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting\\n6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible\\nFull scale needle deflection past the final approach fix\\nNavigation equipment required for the approach fails\\nATC instructs you to go missed\\nUnsafe runway\\nTraffic\\nController or pilot navigation errors\\nWeather \\u2013 e.g., thunderstorm cell\\nWhen the aircraft is being operated below MDA \\u2013 loss of visual references\\nIf your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions\\nIf ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure\\nA controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions\\nVerbal Missed Approach Instructions\\nATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach\\nATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required\\nATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency]. Be advised [Traffic...]\\u201c\\nIf executing instructions different from those on the procedure as dictated by approach, call \\u201con the go\" or \"executing climb out\" to reduce confusion\\n9Missed Approach Chart SymbolsTo provide ready missed approach guidance, approach plates use quick reference icons\\nDue to limited space only four or less icons can be shown. Hence the icons may not show the entire missed approach procedure\\nThe full missed approach instructions are provided textually at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing10JEPP Missed Approach Chart Symbols11NACO Missed Approach Chart Symbols12Climb to altitudeTurn to specified headingTo Specified fixTrack RadialMissed Approach Point LocationThe missed approach point (MAP) on a non-precision approach is\\u2009not designed with any consideration to where the\\u2009aircraft must begin descent to execute a safe landing\\nIt is developed based on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and possibly air traffic considerations\\nDescent below the MDA, including during the missed approach, is not authorized\\nThe Decision Altitude (DA) is an altitude derived location where a missed approach will be initiated on a precision approach\\nObstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach\\nDecision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). 13Obstacle Protection Obstacle protection is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the DA/H or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA)\\nA climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart\\nWhen higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix\\nPreplan your approach to ensure you can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile) \\nHigher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute)\\nTables for climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are on page D1 of U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets\\nFormula: Required Climb Per Minute = ((_[climb gradient]_ ft/nautical mile) x ([ground speed] nautical miles/hour)/60) = 36,000 feet per hour = 14Beginning the Procedure Other Than at the MAP/DHIn the design of the missed approach procedure no consideration is given to an abnormally early missed approach turn from the approach course\\nWhen an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC, \\nFly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point \\nRemain at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver\\nCan begin climb early, absent altitude restrictions\\nThink CFIT when making an early missed!!15Circling Approach MAPExecuting the missed approach after starting the circling maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP\\nThe missed approach is executed for the runway the approach started on, not the runway you were circling to\\nThe initial turn on a missed approach will always be towards the landing runway until established on a segment of the missed approach\\nAlways think about how to execute the missed approach while circling so it is not a surprise if you enter IMC as aircraft is clear of obstacles only when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area16Since the circling missed approach maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost.Flying the Missed ApproachBefore the FAF \\nMemorize initial altitudes and headings\\nSet up No. 2 Nav if possible for missed approach initial navaid course17Flying the Missed Approach\\nInitial Missed Approach Segment ProcedureAt the MAP / DA\\nAdd climb power\\nRotate gradually (on-speed) to Vx\\nCheck for positive rate of climb\\nClean up the aircraft \\u2013 gear and flaps up in the order specified by the POH\\nClimb out at appropriate speed18CommunicateUpon execution of a missed approach and becoming stabilized in climb notify ATC\\nIf communicating with the Tower -

', u' The Missed Approach \\u2013 Hey Where\\u2019s the Runway?1Missed Approach SegmentA Missed approach is a procedure used when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing The Missed Approach Segment is that part of an instrument approach procedure between the missed approach point (MAP), the missed approach way-point (MAWP), or the point of arrival at the decision height and the specified missed approach NAVAID (navigational aid), intersection, fix, or waypoint, as appropriate, at the minimum IFR altitude It is in this part of the approach procedure that the aircraft will climb and return to the en route structure or is positioned for holding or subsequent approach The missed approach route and altitudes are shown on the instrument approach charts2The Missed ApproachThe missed approach is one of the most difficult and critical phases of an instrument approach and is the one practiced the least High workload, as the configuration of the aircraft must be changed (approach to climb out), coupled with new navigation route/Navaids An approach in actual conditions should be flown with the anticipation that the missed approach is an anticipated outcome The missed approach procedure typically includes an initial heading or track to follow, and an altitude to climb to.  This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix Be sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach FAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed: 1.  Whenever: Flight visibility is less than the specified visibility for the approach If required visual references are not seen at either of the following times:  When the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or Upon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DA/DH where a DA/DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that until touchdown. 2.  Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References FAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA: The approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable The threshold The threshold markings The visual approach slope indicator The threshold lights The runway end identifier lights (REIL) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings The touchdown zone lights The runway or runway markings The runway lights Basic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting 6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible Full scale needle deflection past the final approach fix Navigation equipment required for the approach fails ATC instructs you to go missed Unsafe runway Traffic Controller or pilot navigation errors Weather \\u2013 e.g., thunderstorm cell When the aircraft is being operated below MDA \\u2013 loss of visual references If your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure A controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions Verbal Missed Approach Instructions ATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach ATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required ATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency]. Be advised [Traffic...]\\u201c If executing instructions different from those on the procedure as dictated by approach, call \\u201con the go\" or \"executing climb out\" to reduce confusion 9Missed Approach Chart SymbolsTo provide ready missed approach guidance, approach plates use quick reference icons Due to limited space only four or less icons can be shown. Hence the icons may not show the entire missed approach procedure The full missed approach instructions are provided textually at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing10JEPP Missed Approach Chart Symbols11NACO Missed Approach Chart Symbols12Climb to altitudeTurn to specified headingTo Specified fixTrack RadialMissed Approach Point LocationThe missed approach point (MAP) on a non-precision approach is\\u2009not designed with any consideration to where the\\u2009aircraft must begin descent to execute a safe landing It is developed based on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and possibly air traffic considerations Descent below the MDA, including during the missed approach, is not authorized The Decision Altitude (DA) is an altitude derived location where a missed approach will be initiated on a precision approach Obstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach Decision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). 13Obstacle Protection Obstacle protection is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the DA/H or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA) A climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart When higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix Preplan your approach to ensure you can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile)  Higher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute) Tables for climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are on page D1 of U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets Formula: Required Climb Per Minute = ((_[climb gradient]_ ft/nautical mile) x ([ground speed] nautical miles/hour)/60) = 36,000 feet per hour = 14Beginning the Procedure Other Than at the MAP/DHIn the design of the missed approach procedure no consideration is given to an abnormally early missed approach turn from the approach course When an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC,  Fly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point  Remain at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver Can begin climb early, absent altitude restrictions Think CFIT when making an early missed!!15Circling Approach MAPExecuting the missed approach after starting the circling maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP The missed approach is executed for the runway the approach started on, not the runway you were circling to The initial turn on a missed approach will always be towards the landing runway until established on a segment of the missed approach Always think about how to execute the missed approach while circling so it is not a surprise if you enter IMC as aircraft is clear of obstacles only when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area16Since the circling missed approach maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost.Flying the Missed ApproachBefore the FAF  Memorize initial altitudes and headings Set up No. 2 Nav if possible for missed approach initial navaid course17Flying the Missed Approach Initial Missed Approach Segment ProcedureAt the MAP / DA Add climb power Rotate gradually (on-speed) to Vx Check for positive rate of climb Clean up the aircraft \\u2013 gear and flaps up in the order specified by the POH Climb out at appropriate speed18CommunicateUpon execution of a missed approach and becoming stabilized in climb notify ATC If communicating with the Tower - \"[Place] tower, [Callsign], missed approach [Reason]\" If communicating with approach - \"[Place] approach, [Callsign] missed approach off of [Location] climbing through [Altitude] for [Altitude] with request\"19Lost Communications Missed ApproachIf communications are lost during the approach and you take a missed approach: Squawk 7600 Follow the published missed approach instructions to ensure adequate obstruction clearance Route: Proceed to the alternate IAF as filed and commence an approach Altitude: The EXPECTED altitude, if given one, after filing a \\u201cDRAFT\\u201d or;

C.Adequate knowledge of the missed approach procedure elements for standard approaches Initiates the missed approach promptly by applying power, establishing a climb attitude, and reducing drag in accordance with the aircraft manufacturer\\u2019s recommendations Reports beginning the missed approach procedure to ATC Complies with the published or alternate missed approach procedure Advises ATC or examiner anytime that the aircraft is unable to comply with a clearance, restriction, or climb gradient Follows the recommended checklist items appropriate to the go-around procedure Requests, if appropriate, ATC clearance to the alternate airport, clearance limit, or as directed by the examiner Maintains the recommended airspeed within \\xb110 knots; heading, course, or bearing within \\xb110\\xb0; and altitude(s) within \\xb1100 feet during the missed approach procedure. Uses MFD and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position and track to help navigate the missed approach. Demonstrates an appropriate level of single-pilot resource management skills.31Questions32DisclaimerInstrument flight can be dangerous.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The boundaries of the flight envelope will be defined within this document. All speeds are calibrated airspeeds (CAS) (requirement 4.4 ) and given in knots if not stated otherwise. All other units used are metric (SI units). The weights are given in mass units (kg) but the formulas require force units as input, therefore these are calculated in place wherever they are used. Note: The speeds defined within this document should be used for the placards, speed markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by flight test.

Maximum speed in level flight VH According to flight tests  at maximum weight and maximum continuous power at sea level conditions, the maximum speed in level flight has been determined:  Stall speeds VS, VS0, VS1 These speeds will be verified by flight test according to requirement 4.4.1 .  In order to calculate the stall speed, the maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane as a whole is determined first. The maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane has been calculated starting from the polar curve of the wing profile taken form ref.  (p. 236, Re=2.9E6 flaps retracted  and p.237,  for the flaps in landing configuration, and  in take-off configuration). Considering the horizontal tail balancing force and the lower total wing lift due to wing lift distribution, the total aeroplane lift coefficient has been lowered by 15% with respect to the one of the profile.   Therefore aeroplane lift coefficient is estimated to   and for the landing configuration (since the span extension of the flaps is half of the span of the wing):  Stall speeds have been calculated based on these calculated lift coefficients. The wetted wing area SW is used instead of total wing area S because of a lower lift within the fuselage section of the span. Flaps retracted (take-off configuration):  Flaps extended (landing configuration):  Flaps extended (take-off configuration):  With . The stall speed in landing configuration (flaps fully extended to 40 degrees) is 44 kts. Therefore it is In accordance with CS-LSA.5 . In Take-Off configuration (flaps extended to 20 degrees) the stall speed is 47 kts. (Note: These speeds are estimates. The methods for the estimation can be various. It is important that these estimations are as precise as possible. Flight tests will be used to validate the stall speeds. In case the flight tests show different values, this might have an impact on the speeds used for design and ultimately might impair the compliance to the CS-LSA.5.)  Design manoeuvring speed VA According to requirement 5.2.4.1     Flaps maximum operating speed VF According to requirement 5.2.4.2 , such speed shall be not less than the greater of      and   The speed has been selected as:            This is the maximum flap operating speed for the take-off (at 20 degrees) and landing flap settings at 40 degrees. Flaps maximum extension speed VFE On this aeroplane the maximum flap extension speed is identical to the flap operating speed VF.  This speed is the maximum speed for flaps in take-off and landing configuration. Design cruising speed VC According to requirement 5.2.4.3    may not be less than:  and need not be greater than:  The speed has been selected as:  (Note:  can be selected to be higher than  .) (Note:  and VDF ,VD ,VNE correlate with each other. should be selected to allow for a minimum margin of 22% to VDF in order to be able to satisfy the requirements for the next subchapters.) Design dive speed VD According to requirement 5.2.4.4   For  a higher value than the one above has been chosen:  (Note: ASTM F2245-12d 5.2.4.4  requires an exact value for the dive speed. Indeed, such value should be understood as a minimum value. This will be clarified in the next amendment of the CS-LSA.)  Demonstrated dive speed VDF According to requirement 4.1.1.1  VDF must be less than or equal to VD. In this case VDF is equal to VD:  (Note: In case the demonstrated VDF is lower than VD then VNE needs to be limited accordingly which could have an impact on the selection of VC as well.) Never exceed speed VNE According to requirement 4.1.1.2  the VNE Shall be greater than or equal to:  and  must be less than or equal to:  The speed has been selected as:  Note: If the aircraft is equipped with retractable landing gear then VLO must be determined as well (CS-LSA.15 6.12.2). Altitude The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. In fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)

Table 2 \\u2013 Manoeuvring limit load factors  Gust envelope Gust load factors need to be considered because they can exceed the prescribed maximum load factors at different weights and altitudes. Since gust loads depend on air density and aircraft mass they will be calculated for all twelve cases (sea level and 10000ft=FL100, maximum, minimum flying weight and minimum flying weight with full wing fuel tanks) according to requirement 5.2.3.3  with flaps retracted (requirement 5.2.6.1 ) and fully extended (requirement 5.2.6.2 ) at . The calculation is based on appendix X3 . To calculate the gust loads at altitudes other than at sea level the formula X3.1  is altered to include the density at sea level  as well:  The corresponding weights are defined within . Since the gust loads on the wing and tail have been chosen to be treated together,  is the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane ().

This specific one is corresponding to MTOW and FL100. For other design weights the shape of the envelope remains similar, with the difference that the gust lines will change (due to different load factors as per Table 3).

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. Within this document the loads on the wings are determined throughout the whole flight envelope  and for the design weights as determined in  under all loading conditions. The simplified criteria of requirement X.1  have not been used for these calculations. The Loads are calculated using literature methods taken from the documents referenced in chapter 1. The following assumptions are made: Applicable to LSA only; no compressibility effects; conventional configuration (e.g. no tandem aircraft, bi-plane or canard); no pitching moment of the horizontal tail (symmetrical profile); no winglets, no wing tip tanks; no sweep, straight leading edge, no twist, constant profile, no dihedral; effect of the wing deformation on the loads not considered; no spoilers or airbrakes; landing gear attached to fuselage;  no wing struts (cantilever wing);     References List of Abbreviations CG centre of gravity LE leading edge ISA international standard atmosphere by International Organisation for Standardisation  KEAS knots equivalent airspeed MAC mean aerodynamic chord MTOW maximum take-off weight SI international system of units  angle of attack of the wing [deg]  local angle of attack of the station i [deg]  wing zero lift angle of attack [deg]  profile zero lift angle of attack [deg] a lift curve slope [1/deg] AR wing aspect ratio calculated by  [] b wing span [m]  average wing span at station i (mid span position of station) [m]  wing span position of MAC [m]  average fuselage width at wing section [m]  maximum fuselage width (equals ) [m]  local angle between resulting force and normal force at station [deg]  average chord at station i [m]  mean aerodynamic chord [m]  chord at wing root  [m]  chord at wing tip [m]  shear axis relative position as a fraction of local wing chord []  drag coefficient  []  lift coefficient  []  fuselage pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift profile pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient [] D drag force on the wings [N] d span wise drag line loading []  wing sweep of the quarter chord line [deg]  g gravity acceleration [m/s2]  fuselage moment factor []  total wing lift force (on both wings) [N]  local lift at station i [N]  lift line loading on the wing [N/m]  total horizontal tail lift force [N]  total fuselage length [m]  fuselage length in front of wing quarter mean aerodynamic chord point [m]  taper ratio (equals  ) []  wing pitching moment with lift acting on its aerodynamic centre [N]  moments around y axis [Nm]  normal force [N] n load factor [] num total number of stations of a single wing; num = 10 []   density of ambient air at a specific altitude []  running horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  incremental horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  running vertical shear force at station I (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  incremental vertical shear force at station i (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  local resulting force at station i [N] S wing area (not including wing carry-through) []  local tangential force at station i [N]  total torsion around elastic axis of the wing (at wing root) [mN]  local torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  incremental torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  dynamic viscosity (for Reynolds number) [] v airspeed [m/s] W total aircraft weight [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload)  [kg/m2]  total weight of a single wing (with no fuel or payload) [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload) [kg/m2] x longitudinal axis of the aircraft [m] distance to HT quarter chord line from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to aircraft centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to fuel centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE at station i [m]   aerodynamic centre shift due to fuselage pitching moment [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing-fuselage combination with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing fuselage combination from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord)  [m]    shear axis of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m] y lateral axis of the aircraft (span wise direction) [m]  average wing span position at station i [m]  spanwise width of station i [m] z vertical axis of the aircraft [m]  Throughout this document SI-units are used with speeds expected as m/s and angles in degrees if not stated otherwise. Requirements This document covers the following certification specifications requirements: Table 1 \\u2013 Requirements   Input data The values shown below are derived from design data or other compliance documents for this particular aeroplane.   Load Calculation  The following steps have been followed: Load cases: First, the load cases have been identified in, in terms of weight, centre of gravity, speed, load factor, flap/aileron position, Altitude.  External Loads on the wing: for all load cases, the loads on the wing are calculated; Internal Loads in the wing: for the same load cases the internal loads in the wing (shear, bending moment, torsion) are calculated considering also the effect of the inertia of the wing;  Load cases Table 3 comprises all load cases corresponding to the points of the flight envelope  and design weights and centres of gravity .  Important:  Loads corresponding to flap deflected are considered not critical for the wing and will not be calculated in this document (flap loads will be calculated instead for the flap verification). Loads corresponding to landing conditions are considered not critical for the wing (since the landing gear is attached to the fuselage and no tip tanks or other large masses under the wing) and will not be calculated in this document. For the gust load calculations the wing and horizontal tail are treated together according to X3.1 in ref. . The resulting gust load accelerations are therefore calculated using the slope of the lift curve of the aeroplane (see also ) and treated as balanced flight conditions within this document.  Note: These assumptions have been considered realistic for this aeroplane but they are not of generic validity. It is the responsibility of the applicant to define the set of assumptions which can be acceptable for the particular aeroplane.   Altitude: The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. in fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)    Figure 1 \\u2013 Reference flight envelope (WMTOW, FL 100) Table 2 \\u2013 Design weights (explained in ref. ) Table 3 \\u2013 Load cases Note: For this revision of this example document, asymmetric load cases have not been calculated. Loads on the aeroplane Reference axes and sign convention  Figure 2 \\u2013 Aeroplane reference axes The origin is located at the airplane axis of symmetry (x axis) with the y axis passing through the leading edge of the mean aerodynamic chord section of the wing. Symmetrical flight conditions The loads on the wing structure arising from symmetrical flight manoeuvres according to requirements 5.2.2 and 5.2.3  are determined within this chapter.  The following abbreviations are used within this chapter (all measurements with respect to wing leading edge at wing mean aerodynamic chord, forces acting according to arrows are positive) x longitudinal axis of the aircraft z vertical axis of the aircraft CG aircraft centre of gravity HT horizontal tail L lift force on the wings  horizontal tail balancing force (HT lift force)  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient (lift force assumed to act on  )  total pitching moment (must be zero for equilibrium) n W aircraft total weight force (= m*n*g )  distance to HT quarter chord line (of HT MAC as quarter chord line)  distance to aircraft centre of gravity  distance to wing fuselage combination centre of pressure   (lift force acting on not generating any pitching moment)  distance to wing fuselage combination aerodynamic centre   (lift force acting on generating constant pitching moment ) The external forces and moments acting on the aeroplane in a balanced flight condition have been determined. The\\xa0simplified scheme in Figure 3 is considered. The aeroplane is reduced to the wing and the Horizontal tail.  Figure 3 \\u2013 Aeroplane simplified scheme The following forces are considered and placed in equilibrium:  Lift on the wing; Horizontal tail balancing load according to requirement 5.2.2.1 ; Weight of the aeroplane; For the calculation of the equilibrium, the z-axis of the aeroplane is assumed aligned with the direction of the gravity. In a second stage (section 6.4), once the forces are calculated, the corresponding angle of attack will be considered for the calculation of the correct direction of the forces on the wing;  Influence of thrust and drag (of the total airplane) are considered negligible at this stage of calculation of the vertical forces. The effect of the drag will be considered in a second stage on the wing only; The wing lift is assumed to act on the aerodynamic centre of the wing as a starting point. The contribution of the fuselage is accounted for as a shift of the point of aerodynamic centre. This is better explained in section 6.1.5. The HT lift is applied at 25% of the chord; Effects of structural flexure are considered negligible; Angular accelerations are disregarded until the aeroplane has attained the prescribed load factor (according to requirement 5.2.2.3 ); Note: The assumptions above provide a clear simplification to the calculations. The fact that they are used here does not mean that they can always be used. It is the responsibility of the designer to make the appropriate assumptions and to agree them with the Agency. Based on the above assumptions the following equilibrium equations are set. The basis system of equations include 4 equations with the following unknowns: L: wing Lift (including fuselage) CL: wing lift coefficient LHT: HT lift XAC f+w: aerodynamic centre w+f (wing + fuselage; see sec. 6.1.3 and 6.1.5) Equilibrium of moments  (f. 6.1.2.1) Equilibrium of forces   (f. 6.1.2.2) wing pitching moment   (f.6.1.2.3) (for wing) wing lift coefficient  (f. 6.1.2.4) Aerodynamic centre The aerodynamic centre is a characteristic of the wing and it is defined as the point about which the pitch moment does not change with changes of the angle of attack throughout the linear range of the lift curve.  According to  the aerodynamic centre can be estimated by adding a correction factor (shift) to the quarter chord point of the mean aerodynamic chord. The correction factor is a function of the maximum thickness of the profile which in this wing is 16% of the chord. For a tapered wing, the mean aerodynamic chord corresponds to the mean chord and it is  (see ). For this wing the correction factor is 0.012 (from Fig.2  at 16% thickness), so the mean aerodynamic centre of the wing without fuselage is    (f. 6.1.3.1) Pitching moment of the wing The pitching moment of the profile from two dimensional wind tunnel test data  does not represent the moment of a three dimensional with the profile. The pitching moment of the whole wing is calculated according to DATCOM method 1 (formula 4.1.4.1.a ).  (formula 4.1.4.1.a ) (f. 6.1.4.1) With quarter chord sweep angle of the wing .   Influence of the fuselage The fuselage is assumed to provide negligible lift. On the other hand, its influence on the aeroplane equilibrium is accounted for as a contribution to the pitching moment. In particular the following formula (taken from ref ) provides the shift of the aerodynamic centre of the wing due to fuselage pitching moment.  (f. 6.1.5.1) With  and  as input to the diagram in  yielding  and a correction factor of 1.05 due to low-wing configuration. The shift of aerodynamic centre, due to the fuselage, is calculated as:   (f. 6.1.5.2) Forces and moments acting on the wings In previous chapter the Lift and the lift coefficient have been determined. Having those as inputs, the drag and angle of attack are calculated. Total wing drag coefficient  (FIG. X2.1 of)(f. 6.2.1) Drag force on the wings  (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.2) The angle of attack (using as reference instead of ) for each load case is calculated using the following formula:   (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.3) Where: lift curve slope    (FIG. X2.1 of ) (f. 6.2.4) and the zero-lift angle of the wing is taken as . This value is the zero-lift angle of the corresponding wing profile, taken from ref  (p.236).   The results of this chapter for the load cases highlighted in subchapter 0 are presented within the table below. Table 4 \\u2013 Loads on the aeroplane Unsymmetrical flight conditions Note: These load cases will not be calculated within this revision of the example document.   Wing load distribution After having calculated the total load on the wing, the load distribution is calculated and shown in the following sections. Every load is assumed to act on the span wise centre of each station.  Figure 4 \\u2013 Location of wing stations Wing lift distribution The wing lift distribution is calculated here. The lift contribution of the fuselage is assumed to be zero (this means that the load which would act in correspondence of the fuselage, is shifted externally to the wing) leading to more conservative results on the wing loads since they provide higher bending. Note: Alternatively, the applicant would have to determine the reduction in wing lift distribution at the location of the fuselage and demonstrate the validity of the approach.  Figure 5 \\u2013 Effect of the fuselage, areas A (total lift calculated at the end of this chapter)  and B (total lift according to Schrenk) are of equal size   This approach is based on the approximation described by Schrenk  and requires adjustments: moving the apex of the elliptical distribution from the fuselage centre towards the wing root increasing lift of wetted wing sections to compensate for zero lift of fuselage wing section The formula for wing lift distribution is derived from Schrenk  and is altered to assume zero lift at the wing section within the fuselage as shown below. The formula gives the value of the lift for span unit. \\u201ci\\u201d identifies the individual station.   Figure 6 \\u2013  lift distribution with zero lift at fuselage wing section   ()  (f. 6.4.1.1) Now the lift of the wing section within the fuselage is redistributed across the wetted wing area to achieve conservative results. The lift distribution calculated above is adjusted by multiplication of a correction factor derived from comparison between total lift of the whole wing including the fuselage section and the wetted wing only.  Figure 7 \\u2013 Fuselage wing section lift redistributed across wetted wing stations        or  (f. 6.4.1.2) The lift distribution corresponding to the formula above, gives a value of lift at wing tip which is higher than zero and therefore does not fully reproduce the actual loading (the winglift is normally zero at the tip). Nevertheless this assumption does not give significant changes and yields conservative results. The local angle of attack for the station I, as a result of this corrected Schrenk distribution, is given by the following formula:  (from f.6.2.3 and f.6.1.2.4) (f. 6.4.1.3) Note: FAA AC 23-19A, paragraph 23.301, contains other acceptable methods.   Figure 9 \\u2013 Span wise lift distribution  Wing drag distribution Since the effect of the drag is negligible, when compared to the effect of the lift, the span wise drag distribution has been assumed constant throughout wing span. This is a conservative assumption. The drag loading per metre of span:   (f. 6.4.2.1) Wing and fuel mass distribution The local masses are calculated for each wing station to account for the mass of the structure of the wing including the systems and control surfaces (control systems, and other equipment). It is assumed that the wing has a linear distribution proportional to the chord. At each station the point of application of the mass is 45% of the chord.  Figure 10 \\u2013 Wing mass distribution  Figure 11 \\u2013 Fuel distribution A constant fuel distribution (at a point of application of 20% of the chord) is assumed throughout the fuel tank span.  Table 5 \\u2013 Mass distribution with full fuel Wing torsion distribution At each station, the wing lift is assumed to be acting at the local centre of pressure, which is calculated using the formula:  (from eq. 9.17.(d) )  (f. 6.4.4.1) Where, ci is the chord at each station, cm0_w_i is the pitching moment around the aerodynamic centre of the wing section (it is -0.0436 across the wing from chapter 6.1.4), CL_i is the local lift coefficient and comes from the corrected Schrenk distribution () in 6.1.5. Therefore centre of pressure location is dependent on the local angle of attack. Each station\\u2019s lift force acts on its centre of pressure and imposes torsion around the wing elastic axis which for this aeroplane is located approximately at a constant chord percentage of 30% (see design data - the main spar is approximately at 25% of the chord) throughout the entire wing span with local positions  as local shear centres at the stations. Note: the location of the elastic axis for this wing has been assumed at 30%. It is responsibility of the applicant to determine and justify the location of the elastic axis.  Incremental torsion load on structure at each station with respect to local wing shear centre including contribution of fuel and wing structure inertia forces:   (f..2) Torsion at each station i (with respect to shear centre) is:    (f. 6.4.4.3) Distribution of internal loads The components of the internal loads on the wing structure are calculated in different steps for each station. The flight load factor n is assumed to act in parallel to the direction of the lift force instead of the direction of the normal force (As required by 5.2.1.1 of ref. ). The difference is assumed negligible. The incremental shear load parallel to lift force vector at station i is taking into account also the inertia unloading of the wing   (f. 6.4.5.1) Incremental shear load parallel to drag force vector at station i:   (f. 6.4.5.2) With  representing the width of the station i. The summation of incremental shear loads throughout the stations to obtain the absolute shear loads at station i is presented below. Shear load parallel to lift force vector   (f..3) Shear load parallel to drag force vector   (f. 6.4.5.4) The components of the loads along the normal and tangential directions are derived by using the following formulas and figure:  Figure 12 \\u2013 Forces components on the wing (The tangential force is oriented opposite to the x axis and is therefore positive when directed towards the front of the aeroplane.) Resulting force angle   (f.6.4.5.5)  Shear loads along the directions of:  resulting force  (f. 6.4.5.6)  tangential force  (f. 6.4.5.7)  normal force  (f. 6.4.5.8) With the local angle of attack for the station i as a result of the corrected Schrenk distribution given by the following formula:  (from f. 6.4.1.4) Summation of shear loads to obtain the bending moments at each station and using the increased lever arm ( instead of  ) at the wing tip station results in slightly more conservative values. Bending moment along normal direction   (f. 6.4.5.9) Bending moment along tangential direction    (f. 6.4.5.10) The results are presented within the graphs and tables below.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The permissible centre of gravity range is dictated by the aerodynamic design requirements for the airplane. Then the centre of gravity locations corresponding to the critical weights are calculated. All units used are metric (SI units) except for airspeeds (CAS) given in knots if not stated otherwise. Note: The values defined within this document should be used for the placards, markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by testing.

The data contained herein is used to establish aeroplane loading limits: Table 2 \\u2013 Mass items (Note: In this document the weight of the empty aircraft is assumed to be determined through direct weighing. Such information might be needed during early phases of the design, when no prototype is available. In this case the weight of the empty aircraft should be determined through estimation. It is important in this case to have a breakdown of the main items in terms of weight and locations, so that the weight can be kept under control and avoid situations where the assumed envelope cannot be achieved.) Aircraft weights The following design weights have been identified since: either they are clearly required by the CS-LSA requirements, or they impose critical loads or flight characteristics. Basic empty weight WBEW The basic empty weight needs to be determined to identify its centre of gravity according to requirement 4.2.3  as empty CG. All load conditions determined within this document are based on the basic empty weight of the aircraft. It includes empty weight of the aircraft and the unusable amount of fuel. Basic empty weight has been determined to WBEW = 366 kg. Note: The basic empty weight must include all equipment for the operation intended including optional avionics packages \\u2013 for example. Basic empty weight (366 kg) vs maximum empty weight WMEW (400kg) According to 4.2.1 of , the minimum useful load  should be 200kg consisting of 172Kg = both seats occupied with persons of 86kg each (4.2.1.1 ) 28kg = fuel for 1 hour flight at  as determined by  (4.2.1.2 ) According to 3.1.2  the maximum empty weight of the aeroplane shall be equal to: . The aeroplane complies with its Basic empty weight including unusable fuel: . Minimum flying weight Wmin (421kg) The minimum flying weight needs to be determined by requirement 4.2.2  and is a design load case leading to highest load factors during gust penetration. It assumes only a pilot of weight of 55 kg.  Minimum full fuel flying weight WminFF (495kg) The minimum flying weight with full fuel is a design load case imposing highest load factors on the fuel tank. This is critical for the fuel tank design and it can be critical also for the wing structure since in this scenario the highest inertia load on the fuel tank introduces torsion about the shear centre in the same direction of the wing aerodynamic load of the wing (the CG of the fuel is forward to the shear centre which is forward to the wing centre of pressure). Maximum zero wing fuel weight WZWF (600kg) The maximum zero wing fuel weight needs to be determined by requirement 5.2.1.3  and is a design load case for the wing loads due to lowest inertia discharge of the wing structure. In this aeroplane this weight equals the Maximum Take-off weight.  Maximum take-off weight WMTOW (600kg) The total aircraft weight must not exceed 600kg regardless whether the aircraft is on ground or in flight. The gross weight of the aeroplane shall not exceed WMTOW = 600kg. The maximum landing weight equals the maximum take-off weight. Loading cases The following loading conditions have been established to identify the critical cases. Table 3 \\u2013 Loading cases for standard configuration   Centre of gravity location The maximum permissible centre of gravity locations are defined within this chapter. Flight limits The maximum permissible centre of gravity range during flight with respect to datum plane is most forward 0.25m   (required by  4.2.3) most rearward 0.39m   (required by  4.2.3) Limitations on ground The most rearward centre of gravity with the plane on ground must not exceed (with respect to datum plane) 0.46m to prevent the aircraft from flipping on the tail although not more than 0.41m might be reached with the most critical loading configuration. Centre of gravity envelope The following table of load cases defines the limits for the certified envelope of centre of gravity locations and the position of load cases of 6.7 within the envelope. Table 4 \\u2013 Load cases on centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration   The centre of gravity envelope covers all valid loading cases.  Figure 1 \\u2013 Centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration Expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification To cover alterations to the aeroplane where need might arise or after certification the aeroplane will be tested and certified against an extended envelope. Additional weights will be added during testing at their corresponding locations to establish the desired loading cases. Table 5 \\u2013 Weights required to achieve expanded envelope for certification   The expanded centre of gravity envelope is defined by the load cases below using ballast weights at their corresponding locations. Table 6 \\u2013 Load cases on expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification Note: The values above are preliminary assumptions. Ballast weights need to be checked to be in accordance with airframe strength limitations and their impact on the flight characteristics in terms of inertia before test flights. This might require narrowing the centre of gravity envelope.

use of deter planning and fmc performance cruise performance monitoring can help airlines identify and solve performance performance monitoring will identify need for boeing to assist in determining the solution to given in with good understanding of the monitoring process and the interactions among the variables airlines heir own problem diagnosing and cruise performance monitoring has been used for many years by airlines that strive to operate their airplanes as as these airlines know that continuous cruise performance monitoring of airplanes in their can decrease operating costs relative to airlines that do not monitor airplane performance continuous cruise performance monitoring can give airlines the information they need just the baseline performance levels they use for planning and management computer mc fuel predictions so that the correct amount of fuel is loaded on each and every entify normal deterioration for of ch the airplanes that perform best to their longest entify high fuel burning airplanes for possible validate performance degradation for extended twin operations top critical fuel reserves planning lieu of the regulatory requirement of percent fuel mileage deterioration crease crew in plans and possibly decrease the amount of discretionary fuel requested and an less recognized of cruise performance monitoring is diagnosing and solving various airplane performance problems or these case studies show how cruise performance monitoring was used to determine solutions to three different an airline that operates airplane was concerned about what it considered to be ive fuel mileage deterioration relative to the fuel mileage levels its airplanes exhibited when they were the airline requested help from both boeing and the engine manufacturer in te mining what was causing this deterioration the the or through better understanding of the contributions that airframe and engine deterioration make to the overall fuel mileage the airline could more focus its maintenance to help resolve this the airline proposed an experiment involving an engine exchange airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration by dave flight operations and carolyn aerodynamics engineer aero quarterly ew total fuel mileage diff ence ol to ne airplane using he ol an ne engine between an old and new six which was operating about percent below the planning database level of fuel represented the old while soon represented the new the airline requested assistance and support from boeing and the engine manufacturer in carrying out the which sure pre fuel mileage on both the new and the old airplane swap all four engines between the new and old sure fuel mileage again on both the new and the old airplane by using the same physical set of four engines on two different the and the engine manufacturer agreed that any measurable difference in fuel mileage for the same set of engines on two different airframes could be attributed to airframe effects alone that drag position was that proper maintenance of the exterior of an airplane would lead to minimal amounts of drag deterioration as an airplane as the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including so that it would be considered as having properly maintained exterior before the engine control surfaces were seals were and one engine was minor leak in the pneumatic discovered during the was not by the airline to cause about percent penalty in fuel fuel mileage data was collected before and after the to determine any change across the especially to quantify any changes resulting from rigging the control surfaces and replacing any worn fuel mileage improved percent after the with percent attributed to proper rigging of the controls and percent attributed to the changing of one fuel mileage data was then collected on both the old and new airplanes before and after the engine the data collected was combination of in data collected by the airplane condition monitoring system acm and hand data that was collected under more controlled test average results from all four sets of data were then compared to determine the differences in fuel mileage between the old and new airplanes with the same set of for both the old and new the average improvement in fuel mileage for the new airframe relative to the old airframe was about the initial conclusion could be that the older airframe must contribute about percent toward the overall fuel mileage deterioration originally observed on the old airplane and engine about percent of that difference is of the total calculated difference of the pneumatic duct leakage discovered on the old airplane during the contributed about in the old airplane did not have the same revised vertical fairing as the new if the older airplane had had the newer vertical it is estimated that the fuel mileage would have improved about after adjusting for the pneumatic system leak and the newer vertical for the same set of engines the old fuel mileage averaged about percent worse than the new the results are supportive of the position that the drag deterioration of well airplane most likely will not exceed more than about the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including ration ne vertical fin fairing pneumatic leakage actual unexplainable diff ence case study to help determine the primary cause of the fuel mileage boeing and the airline collected fuel mileage data on both new and old before and after an engine an airline expressed concern to boeing that its new airplanes equipped with aviation partners boeing apb blended winglets were exhibiting fuel mileage performance more than percent worse than the boeing database while its winglet approximately two years displayed fuel mileage performance similar to the database the which collects cruise fuel mileage data on an ongoing based its analysis on acm cruise fuel mileage data analyzed using the boeing airplane performance monitoring apm in initial discussions between boeing and the it was explained that the database being used by the airline to represent the with blended winglets was based on the original winglet test results completed in early this is the same database used in the flight crew operations the mc and the operational planning additional tests had led to best assessment of the delivered performance of the which showed slightly less improvement than the original this revised based on several add al test programs conducted in and includes different winglet drag increment to winglet and an aer elastic correction absent in the earlier at mach the difference between the two databases varies from percent to depending on the exact conditions with the database predicting better fuel mileage increment because of the winglets in all upon the airline provided boeing with acm data for two of its airplanes with blended boeing analyzed the data for each airplane using both the operational database and the revised while the data on about percent closer to the newer database level than the operational database analysis did not agree with the analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the further discussions with the airline revealed that it had been using passenger weight allo of kg per including carry and kg per checked bag for all of its as of june the airline changed to the higher passenger weight allowances recommended in the joint aviation requirements operations ar checked baggage would be weighed whenever ar checked baggage weight allowances would be the average passenger weight allowances are higher than the kg per passenger the airline had been because the data sent to boeing for the two winglet airplanes was collected prior to june it was based on the lighter weight allowance of kg per investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the aero quarterly the analysis was based on data using combination of the weight as the investigation the airline sent additional data to boeing for the same two winglet airplanes but only for conditions recorded after june based on the higher jar weight the airline also included data for one more winglet as well as for three winglet the data for the two winglet airplanes showed an immediate fuel mileage improvement of about percent for each based on analyzing only the data from ar weight allowances collected after june this result led quickly to the belief that the previous kg per passenger weight allowance was too although both the fuel mileage and thrust required changed between data based on kg per passenger and data based on ar passenger weight the thrust fuel consumption tsf hardly errors in the estimated weight of an airplane present themselves as high or low drag but do not affect the fuel tsf deviations calculated by apm improvement was observed for both of the winglet airplanes originally analyzed with data recorded before june the results for all six airplanes were still not as good as what boeing experience indicated for this further investigation determined that this airline operates its of in mix of both scheduled and holiday charter using the ar weight allowances called out for the data sent to boeing for the six airplanes included mixture of data from both these types of the average passenger weight allowance recommended for scheduled service is kg per passenger and kg per passenger for charter service are higher than the kg per passenger originally used by the at the airline separated all of the post june data into two charter service and scheduled the data for each group was reanalyzed separately and the analysis revealed discrepancy in demonstrated fuel mileage and thrust levels between the charter and scheduled if airplane weight is perceived airplane performance will be poorer than weight that is unaccounted for shows up as increased airplane drag and decreased fuel in this the tsf deviations remained consistent between both sets of but the thrust deviations increased for the charter strong indication of unaccounted airplane in this boeing proposed that the jar passenger weight allowances as recommended for holiday charter were underestimating the airplane weight for this particular charter although the airline was receptive to the possibility that the ar passenger weight allowances might be too light for its holiday charter it was not fully the airline believed that the ar weight allowances for scheduled could just as easily be in which case their airplanes were performing as poorly as the charter data to determine which weight allowances were the airline and boeing agreed to collect delivery performance data on the next new airplane with production blended winglets the advantages of collecting delivery data as opposed to in data he performance level of the airplane could be established at he airplane would be weighed at the boeing factory with all the weight changes following weighing but preceding delivery accurately tracked and published in the weight and balance the delivery empty weight could be considered delivery are with minimum so the issue of passenger weight allowances would not after collecting cruise performance data on the delivery the airline would continue with its standard in data collection on both scheduled and charter comparing the results from the delivery with the results obtained in would help determine which jar passenger weight allowances gave the airline more accurate airplane gross if the weight allowances were too heavy airplane was actually lighter than then the in performance would appear to be better than the delivery if the weight allowances were too light airplane was heavier than then the in performance would appear to be worse than the delivery the airline provided boeing with the weeks of acm in data for the airplane following separating the data for charter and scheduled for this the data was analyzed relative to the most recent with winglets although the delivery results showed the airplane to be slightly better than the demonstrated database the early in charter results show the airplane with an average per fuel mileage percent worse than the demonstrated level unaccounted weight shows up as airplane drag according to the charter the airplane experienced percent increase in thrust required on entering partially offset by percent drop in engine tsf for percent drop in fuel mileage from the delivery when the same ai scheduled service data for the same time period was the fuel mileage was much closer to the delivery average in fuel mileage for the weeks of operation deviated from the delivery level by only percent percent below the demonstrated which is within the acm ability to determine fuel mileage over given time these results supported the conclusion for this the ar passenger weight allo for scheduled more accurately the true weight of the passengers plus carry baggage than the weight allowances recommended for the charter in both are much more representative than the original kg per passenger the airline had been the weight allowances for scheduled of kg per passenger produce more accurate zero fuel weight buildup and truer representation of the actual performance of the with or without the results of this case study airplane weight buildup issue for this particular boeing suggested that the jar holiday charter passenger weight allowances appeared to be too light for this with unaccounted weight showing up as excess airplane thrust required using the ar passenger weight allowances for scheduled the fuel mileage performance for its with and without

data was based on the production reinforced the two sets of data were analyzed separately in order to identify any differences in the improvement based on differences in the baseline before the winglets were boeing analyzed the data for all airplanes using the same in software tools used to analyze boeing these software tools are different from the apm software provided to airline but the analysis produces basically the same the main difference is that the boeing in software normalizes the data points to nominal weight to pressure ratios chosen by boeing while the apm software does the improvements were plotted versus in order to illustrate that the magnitude of the improvement depends on for given mach this dependency on is because the winglet improvement is function of airplane

process was followed for each and for the various sets of data and analysis of the data indicated slight improvement in drag and fuel mileage that resulted from the reinforcement of the wing the results indicated this improve to be relatively small but still worth an average of few tenths of percentage at normal cruise weights and including the effects of both the wing strengthening and the addition of the the fuel mileage and drag improve closely matched their predicted because the improvement in drag is of for given cruise the actual improvement in fuel mileage that the airline would experience for any given conditions depends on the during that the change in total fuel required to given route is determined by combination of the improvement in fuel mileage offset by any increase

increasing economic and regulatory pressures make it imperative for unities to reduce costs and show conformance to because airline maintenance operations represent airlines have asked boeing for help in reducing this recent results show that changing the way service bulletins are prepared and delivered combined with airline process improvements can reduce maintenance cosy and improve the ability to show boeing has continually made enhancements to the and delivery of its service past enhancements include digital and tabular work boeing has been working directly with airlines to reduce end costs for service bulletin during this it was observed that when airlines create their engineering they rewrite or engineer service bulletins and kit or repackage the kit of parts to match their own engineering this engineering causes unnecessary delays and expense for the airlines in implementing service boeing developed the enhanced service also known as the generation service to minimize this engineering effort while making it easier and less expensive to implement service the enhanced service in conjunction with airline process will enable smooth ensuring that and tools are staged in coordinated manner to support the mechanic during service bulletin enhanced service bulletins incorporate four key lean work faster access to essential improved kit and selective information these

show compliance with the aero quarterly th liner ta adv age of ne tec ologies to increase lit an pro ve lit with the boeing is using new approach to design which takes into greater account the cost to maintain airplane structure and systems over their as result of this the basic airplane will have percent lower airframe maintenance costs than any comparable product and will be available for revenue service more often than any other commercial the boeing program has consciously designed in state features and performance that reduce cost and increase airplane these features will lead to additional savings and greater revenue for boeing the new life design philosophy that has dictated some changes in the way the airplane will be these changes include extensive use of composites in the airframe and primary an electric systems reliable and maintainable and an improved maintenance taken these changes will offer customers guaranteed reduction in maintenance the life cost approach to design looks at the total cost picture for design options by examining all of the factors that affect an airplane over its the value of given design solution has been measured using factors such drag weight oise and schedule reliability development cost cost using these measures to compare design options helps determine the optimum with the boeing has expanded the life design approach by adding two unique performance maintenance cost and airplane looking at the cost to maintain systems over their lifetimes becomes factor when attempting to understand the total effect of design decision on an cost airplane availability includes not only schedule reliability but also other factors such as the length of time an airplane must be out when maintenance is taking an airplane out of service for two days has much bigger effect on operator revenue than taking it out of service for two boeing from the ground upby justin deputy chief mechanic aero quarterly advanced steel landing boeing makes greater use of composite materials in its airframe and primary structure than any previous boeing commercial under the design process without preconceived ideas enabled boeing engineers to specify the optimum material for applications throughout the the result is an airframe comprising nearly half carbon reinforced plastic and other this approach offers weight savings on average of percent compared to more conventional aluminum selecting the optimum material for application meant analyzing every area of the airframe to determine the best given the operating environment and loads that component experiences over the life of the for aluminum is sensitive to tension loads but handles compression very on the other composites are not as in dealing with compression loads but are excellent at handling the expanded use of especially in the highly tension environment of the greatly reduces maintenance due to fatigue when compared with an aluminum this type of analysis has resulted in an increased use of titanium as where loading indicates metal is preferred material system but environmental considerations indicate aluminum is poor titanium is an excellent low design titanium can withstand comparable loads better than has minimal fatigue con and is highly resistant to titanium use has been expanded on the to roughly percent of the total every structural element of the has

scheduled per ence with the boeing proves that composite require less scheduled maintenance than noncom for the composite tail is percent larger than the aluminum yet requires percent fewer scheduled maintenance labor this labor hour reduction is due to the result of reduced risk of corrosion and fatigue of composites compared with reduced nonroutine com structure also results in less nonroutine the structure is all composite and highlights the advantages of this material when applied in harsh environ airline operators are aware of the fatigue cracking and corrosion experienced with traditional aluminum the model has been for more than years with more than airplanes in the and to date has not replaced single composite boeing has also implemented rigorous process for evaluating the use of aluminum that combines likelihood of corrosion with consequence of this scoring system provides measure for establishing acceptable application of aluminum in the design with full understanding of the maintenance corrosion and fatigue in structure add to the nonroutine maintenance burden on an nonroutine maintenance frequently or even triples the total labor hours expended during maintenance with the expanded use of composites and titanium combined with greater discipline in usage of boeing expects the to have much lower nonroutine labor costs than more conventional metallic in addition to using robust structural design in damage such as passenger and cargo the has been designed from the start with the capability to be repaired in exactly the same manner that airlines would repair an airplane today with bolted the ability to perform bolted repairs in composite structure is service on the and offers comparable repair times and skills as employed on metallic by bolted repairs in composite structure can be permanent and damage just as they can be on metal in airlines have the option to perform bonded composite which offer improved aerodynamic and aesthetic these repairs are damage and do not require an while typical bonded repair may require or more hours of airplane boeing has taken advantage of the properties of composites to develop new line of maintenance repair capability that requires less the right material for the right without preconceived boeing engineers were able to specify the optimum material for applications throughout the aero

name or you can program the kln to default to certain letter as when you are entering point see section to learn about this handy all airport identifiers receive the prefix airport identifiers which are combinations of letters and numbers do not apply to the prefix examples of airport identifiers not using the prefix are and if you are entering or looking for an airport that is all letters then it will begin with prefix in the contiguous in alaska some or in if there are numbers in the identifier then prefix is not for other areas of the world the airport stored in the kln data base is

it to the maximum great way to get to know the kln is to use it outside the using what we call the are products available which allow you to use the kln at your or hotel to have time in the for instance the commander from lone star it is also helpful to do flight planning and perform data base updates outside the perhaps with home personal more information on the commander or to place an star aviation tatum drive tx the kln is in the it performs as if it receiving adequate satellite signals to determine its it displays the latitude and longitude of its last known position or of whatever tion it is initialized to on the setup page section and time to first in ground speed and heading may be entered on the set page and the kln will track flight plan or direct to point just as if it was actually functioning in an distances count points and the tion bar follows the progress of the simulated using the mode is an excellent way to learn the operation of the kln without worrying about the engine other or even these phenomena are not simulated in the kln approaches and and approaches and this is the last chapter on the operation of the kln in this chapter you will learn how to use the kln for approach and note that only kln which are configured for ifr approaches are capable of performing the procedures discussed in this kln which are figured for en route and terminal operations only will give you access to procedures but not all of these procedures require that you are comfortable with the operation of the unit as presented up to this in you need to be comfortable with flight plan operation and and the obs mode approach operations flying approaches using the kln are not in selves very it is different than using traditional equipment such as and with this in make sure that you practice with the kln in vfr weather with check pilot before attempting to use the kln in actual ifr the kln obtains approach information from the data it is extremely important that the data base is the kln is approved for ifr approaches only when the data base is if you attempt to select an approach when the data base is out of you will be given the base in the bottom left portion of the screen as following sections assume that your kln is installed in the aircraft with all of the necessary accessories to fly in most cases this will mean that the craft has external to arm the approach an external annunciator to indicate when message is active and when point sequencing is about to occur will also be in some installations the aircraft will have switch to select which navigation source is displayed on the primary hsi or nav page has been specifically designed to provide most the functions needed for this page an interface that presents pertinent navigation way to access the flight and graphic presentation of the sent position relative to the flight plan you will find this page to be good friend while performing gps based approaches and and there are some approach procedures in the world that not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data therefore it is not possible to use the kln for these it is good flight practice ensure that the kln contains anticipated procedures for the addition to the two course modes and described in there are also two approach these are approach arm and approach the status of the approach mode is ed on an external in most installations the external annunciator will indicate for the approach arm and approach active will be annunciated by the main ence of these modes from the normal en route mode is that the integrity monitoring is set to tighter another difference between these modes and the en route mode is that the cdi scale factor will usually change to nm for arm and will always change to nm when in the apr the arm mode can be selected in two the normal way is that this mode will be selected automatically by the kln when the aircraft is within nm of an airport and an approach is loaded in the flight plan for that it is possible to arm the approach mode at distance greater than nm from the airport by pressing the al gps approach but the kln will not change the cdi scale factor until the aircraft reaches the nm if the gps apr external switch is pressed while the approach mode is then the kln will disarm the approach and change back to en route the cdi scale factor will also change back to the approach can be by simply pressing the gps apr switch the apr mode can only be engaged automatically by the to cancel the apr mode press the external gps apr this will change the mode to apr once past the it is not possible to return to the approach active mode without missed approach and flying back to the procedure for approaches approaches will all have the general flow of events refer to figure and load the approach into the flight can one at almost any time but must be completed before reaching the final approach fix and should be done as soon as kln approaches and and corresponds to point in figure if the aircraft is greater than nm from the then the cdi scale factor will remain at the default nm full scale to the approach arm this will occur when the aircraft is within nm of the airport and there is an approach loaded into the flight plan in ure the cdi scale factor will change to nm over the next seconds and the external

procedure when is and the active point is the and you have flown past the map number in section necessary conduct the missed approach remember to always refer to the paper chart when conducting missed the obs mode is usually needed at some point during missed approach and is always required to fly the holding pattern in figure details of the above operations as well as several examples how to conduct approaches using the kln are given in the following and and selecting an the first item in the list from the previous section is to select and load the approach into the active flight approaches are selected from the apt act page of the airport for which you desire to shoot the if you are operating from flight the est way to get to the approach information is by turning to the act page for your destination as described in section following example will use the vor or gps rwy to los angeles international airport select and load an into the active flight plan to one of the apt pages and select lax by using the and outer knobs the right inner knob to turn to the apt if you ed lax from the apt page turn the inner knob one click to reach the apt the cursor on by pressing the cursor comes up on the first approach in the list of use the right outer knob to move the cursor to different approaches if there are more than approaches to an airport you can move the sor down to the other procedures into view by rotating the right outer the flashing cursor over vor kln will present list of initial approach fixes corresponding to this in this example we want the select this by pressing when the cursor over if there is only one iaf for then the kln skip this step and go on to the next approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and many cases atc will not tell you explicitly which iaf to these cases you need to select an iaf which is closest to the route of flight that you if you expect radar then the selection of the correct iaf is less important because you will be given vectors to the and will not need to use the kln next presents list of points that make up the review these points to make sure that you have selected the correct if there are more than four points in the approach you can move the cursor up to other points into view by rotating the right outer knob the cursor over add pl and kln will then bring up the pl page and put the sequence of approach points in front of the airport reference point any time during the process of selecting an approach can easily return to the previous step by pressing the points that make up the approach procedure are loaded the flight at the top of the list of approach points is that describes the approach that an example of this is shown on line of figure which indicates that the vor approach for los angeles international airport is in the active flight plan the approach has been entered into the flight plan the kln to make sure that the resulting flight plan if the kln detects any points that are in both the en route tion of the flight plan and the portion that makes up the then the following message will be pts in edit en route pts as apt vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and the flight plan and delete those en route points that not can only be entered into pl the active if the kln is turned off for more than then the approach is deleted when power is turned back interpreting what you in the example you may have noticed couple of swith somewhat strange the second point of the approach has name that is not normal for this is an example of what are called these are points that are associated with specific they are used to define spot on the ground that does not have normal point in the case of this point is nm from the lax vor on the the fifth point in the approach is another type of terminal in this case this point is the missed approach point for runway this approach applies to both the left and right runways so the letter is used to mean are few other types of terminal points that you will need tobe familiar with to fully understand gps the naming convention for these points are as stands for final approach stands for intermediate stands for course stands for missed approach rw stands for runway this is usually the map for the zzz will be runway number possibly including for for for or for stands for dme arc aaa is the radial that the fix is on from the reference will be letter corresponding to the distance from the reference for is the seventh letter of the alphabet so would be point on the nm from the reference dme arcs greater than nm will have points where the first two characters are the first two letters of the dme the next three characters will be the radial that the arc way point is the rules above and are defined as for runways only one will be replaced with an or for ways that have multiple will be replaced with for for or for the letters will be replaced with either the runway identifier for circling the inbound course to the missed approach point along given radial will be named such that the first letters are the reference and the next two are the dme if the distance is greater than nm the order is for is nm from lax while is nm from the aircraft is not too far from the destination the nav can be used to determine where some of these points are relative to others in the at the time of this all of the nos charts and some en charts do not show the special points that are required for gps for this reason it is good idea to understand what the special points are used for and what they may have also noticed that some points have small at the end of the point the small letter is an aid that we have added to the name of some points to help you recognize important points in the these suffixes are displayed on many of the kln the definitions of these suffixes the initial approach fix of the the final approach fix of the approach the missed approach point of the approach the missed approach holding point for the every approach will have and almost all will have an iaf and missed approach holding another item that you should notice the flight plan is the line that has on it this is what is referred to as fence and the purpose of this line is to tell you approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and kln will not automatically sequence past the point precedes the the point before the fence is always the missed approach the reason that point sequencing is not allowed is that many missed approach procedures require specific actions before going to the missed approach holding point climbing on fixed heading until reaching an changing or deleting an approach loaded into the flight the sequence of points that are retrieved from the data base of the kln define the approach procedures as they are to ensure that the proper path over the ground is it is not possible to either delete or add points to the approach section of the flight to help you see which points are en route points and which are approach the kln does not display colon next to the point number on the pl page if the point is an approach it is only possible to replace the existing approach with another delete the entire approach from the flight replace an existing or delete an the left page displaying the active flight plan turn the cursor on by pressing the cursor so that it covers the approach header at the top the approach once the cursor comes over the approach it will automatically change to read if you in this condition the kln bring up the apt page that corresponds to the current at this point it is ble to select different approach different or you press the button the cursor is over the approach header it will change to read delete if you press the kln vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and remove the entire approach procedure from the active flight if the kln was in the approach arm or the approach active then deleting the approach will cause the kln to change back to en route this means that the cdi scale factor will change back to the default nm example no procedure turn now that you know the basics of inserting an approach into the we can now show the approach operation of the unit by several this first example will use the approach that was loaded into the flight plan in section this example will show how the kln sequences through an approach and what type of and scale factor changes can be the kln will remain in the familiar leg mode so there will be no need to change between leg and obs mode in this refer to the approach plate for this approach to see what the procedure looks this example it is assumed that you are on an active flight with the final destination being the los angeles international it is also assumed that atc will not give you radar vectors during this the vor approach to lax as demonstrated in tion you are within nm of the the kln will ically arm the approach mode and provide the following alt to set the message acts as reminder to make sure the kln is the correct barometric if the barometric information is not then the integrity monitoring provided by the kln will not be as good as it could press to bring up the alt page verify that the barometric pressure is if the kln is interfaced with compatible air data that provides the correct barometric pressure to the kln then the previous message is not displayed and it is not necessary to update the barometric this time the kln will smoothly change the cdi scale factor the external approach annunciator installed in the aircraft will indicate that the approach is in the arm kln approaches and and you approach the kln will provide point alerting on the external annunciator as well as on the screen of the kln once you pass the kln will ically sequence to the next point in the approaches and and may be good time to select the nav this page is especially useful for getting feeling of where you are in the approach the aircraft approaches the the kln will again provide point as the aircraft passes and sequences to the kln will provide message telling you to set the external indicator or to new if desired track is shown on the this value will flash when the external selected course does not match the tk within the aircraft approaches the it is good idea to check over the status of the kln look at the kln screen to verify that leg sequencing is the kln will not transition to the approach active mode if the obs mode is if the kln shares an hsi or cdi with other nav it is also good to verify that the switch is set to the time the aircraft is nm from by the final approach the kln will make prediction to see if integrity will be available at the and at the if the diction indicates that integrity monitoring will be and aim is currently the kln will change the gps apr annunciator to read at this time the kln will also start to change the cdi scale by the time the aircraft reaches the the cdi scale factor will be down to fix is not included in the list of points provided in the data you will need to identify this point by using the along track distances given in the profile view of the approach in this example is located nm from the when the distance to is then the aircraft is at and you can descend to the for this approach procedures require that you add up distances to be able to identify step down vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and kln will again provide point alerting as you approach this is shown on the nav page by flashing active point identifier following steps would need to be performed if missed approach is reaching and not seeing the runway you decide to perform missed the kln will not automatically sequence past the missed approach this is shown on the nav page by not showing any lines connecting points that are past the to perform the published missed approach press to bring up the the default point will be the first point of the missed approach in this case the first point is confirm this point as the direct to point and press reaching the kln will sequence to the next point in the missed approach in this there is no holding pattern published for the missed approach so you can expect further instructions upon reaching atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th example an approach that is quite common is an approach that is based off fan an example of this is the vor rwy approach to clovis new mexico municipal to fly this procedure as published use the following steps and refer to figure for the for this example assume that the aircraft approaches and and approaching from the northeast going the clovis airport with no active flight the approach into the flight plan as described in section in this case there is only one iaf so the kln does not present the option for you to select an in this there is no active flight plan to begin with so the kln will ask to add the approach to pl the area atc tells you to go the vor and clears you for the approach to this is easy to do from the nav page by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning through the active flight plan by turning the inner once is displayed in the scanning window press and then to direct to operation to the distance of nm to the the kln will give the following required select this message provides reminder that to fly course reversal obs mode needs to be note from the approach chart that there is opt arrival sector for this if you are ing within the indicated area there is no need to perform course reversal and you need to ignore this the opt sector is not stored in the data base so it is not possible for the kln to know if course reversal is required or as the kln will always give this message whenever point could be used for course the kln will properly sequence to the to map leg and transition to the approach mode when nm from the you are approaching from any other direction course reversal is required and the obs mode will need to be if the obs mode is not selected before reaching then the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach this is not desirable when performing course reversal so the obs mode must be selected before reaching the kln will only remind you to select obs mode if iaf is the active therefore if course reversal is make sure the iaf is the selected approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and course reversal is then upon reaching perform the appropriate holding pattern entry and set the inbound course on the external cdi or in this example the inbound course is at this point the kln works very similar to al established on the inbound course of switch back the leg when leg mode is selected the is cally made the active point when the iaf and the are at the same is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor this will make the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active the aircraft is nm from the the kln will verify that the proper integrity is if integrity monitoring is available for the then the kln will change to the approach active this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to reaching the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach fix at dme from along the final approach course is not included in the points that come from the data since the distance that the kln is giving you is distance the you will need to mentally figure out when the has reached this is done by looking at the along distances given in the plan view of the in this case the fix is nm from upon reaching this distance you can descend to the for this missed approach is required for this then the steps would be published missed approach procedure for this approach is to make climbing left turn to feet and proceed direct to the in this case will be the default direct to point kln approaches and and is this is the desired point so press to confirm the point and proceed direct to the if atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to the aircraft approaches you will need to select obs mode to stop point sequencing and define the inbound course for the holding if you do not select the obs mode before the aircraft is within nm of the holding then the kln presents message reminding you to select the obs another attempt at the approach is desired after itis necessary to manually change the active when the and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active point to the when you change from obs to make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active example radar for this example we will use the same approach that was used in previous section except this approach will be conducted with the help of radar vectors from approach the aircraft will be assumed to be arriving from the although this does not change the way the approach will be flown using the kln approach has been selected and entered into the flight plan and the aircraft is going direct to vn new mexico as described in section soon as atc mentions radar vectors you should immediately start to think of the obs once given radar change the active point to and select the obs note that it is not important what order these events take it is just as effective to change to obs mode and then change the active point as it is to change the active point and then switch to obs change the selected course on the cdi or hsi to the final approach for this the inbound course is is now possible to watch your progress on the nav page and anticipate when you will be given new headings to fly established on the inbound you will need to change back to the leg mode to allow for proper approach operation and automatic leg for best the change back to leg mode should be made before the aircraft is nm from the it is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor this will make the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active rest of this approach would be flown using the same steps as presented in section and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and example another common type of approach is an approach that is based onan these could be either vor or ndb an example of this type of approach is the vor rwy approach to bowman airport in kentucky the airport identifier for this airport is approaches and and this example assume that the aircraft is approaching lou the nabb passing the nabb you are told to expect the vor approach at you load the approach using the procedure described in section the distance from the present position to the destination airport reaches the kln will automatically arm the approach the cdi scale factor will transition to nm and the kln will provide more sensitive integrity you also press to update the barometric the aircraft is nm from the qm the kln will give message reminding you to select the obs the obs mode is required for the procedure after passing select the outbound course of the external cdi or aircraft is now headed outbound for the procedure as soon you will need to change the active point to the final approach this is done by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning until is displayed in the dow then pressing then pressing the course will still be what is ed on the external cdi or hsi the obs mode selected and as the active it is possible to fly the procedure allow enough distance past to complete the procedure turn and still be nm away before reaching the after completing the outbound portion of the procedure change the selected course to the inbound course of the external cdi or established on the inbound course the leg mode will again need to be selected so that proper approach operation and point sequencing will is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the apt vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th kln approaches and and this makes the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active the aircraft is nm from the the kln will verify that the proper gps integrity is if integrity monitoring is available for the then the kln will change to the approach active this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to point alerting will occur as the aircraft passes the final approach the leg from the final approach fix to the missed approach point will become active and the cdi scale factor will remain at if the auto scale factor was selected on the nav then the scale factor will zoom in on the airport as the aircraft gets closer and closer to the missed approach eventually the map scale changes to following steps are followed if missed approach is missed approach instructions call for climbing left turn to heading of intercepting the course to missed approach holding to fly this with the kln it will be necessary to put the kln into the obs mode and make the active change the selected course on the external cdi or hsi to the aircraft reaches you will need to perform holding pattern entry suitable for this holding pattern and set the selected course to the holding example dme dme arc procedures with the kln are completely different using traditional vor and dme worry because dme arc procedures using the kln are also easier than using traditional this is because the kln guidance around the no more having to watch distance in one place and radial in being dme arc is really whole bunch of approach fixes placed one next to each other to form an very rarely do you actually fly to the beginning of an especially in radar the flight path of the aircraft generally intersects the arc at some once the aircraft is near the it is then possible to turn so that the arc distance is maintained until time to turn to the inbound following example will show how dme arc procedures are using the kln this example approach will be to use the vor rwy approach to the approach plate for this approach is in figure assume that the aircraft is approaching from the north and is in radar assigns the vor rwy turn to the apt page for to select the you select the vor approach and the kln sents the iaf selection page are five choices for the three of these choices you can recognize but the other and are ar and not shown on this these two points are the data base identifiers for the ends of the means dme arc is the radial on which the point and cates the distance of the is the twelfth letter of the alphabet so the indicates that this is dme in similar manner can also be in this example the aircraft is approaching from the north so the iaf will be kln knows that this point is associated with dme once an arc point is the kln determines what radial of the reference vor the aircraft is presently located point is created that is located at the intersection of the sent radial and the dme this point is the first point in the list of points presented on the apt page before approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the approach into the flight this point is named using the same tion discussed the present radial from the reference vor is outside of the defined then the kln will default to the beginning of the approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the kln does not take into account the try of the active flight plan when determining the arc intercept this point is defined solely on the present radial and the defined arc distance from the reference for this reason it is better to delay selecting approaches that contain dme arcs until the aircraft is closer to the the cursor over add to pl press the approach will be loaded into the active flight plan just like any other approach would the approach is loaded into the flight plan the kln may give the pts in edit en route pts as this message is given because very often it will be necessary it the active flight plan to ensure that proper point ing examine the flight plan if observe the nav page to make sure that the sequence of points does not have any unnecessary legs in kln will now provide guidance to the arc intercept the nav page displays the entire arc on the the tion that is between the beginning of the arc and the arc intercept is drawn with dashed the part that is between the arc ept point and the end of the arc is drawn with the normal solid line some cases atc may provide radar vectors to the the kln provides means to define new intercept point based on the current track of the aircraft over the this can be done from either the nav page or from the pl the dashed line displayed on the nav page will help you to mine if atc is giving you correct the nav pull out the right inner knob to bring up the point scanning the right inner knob until the first point of the arc is in this for approaches this will have small appended to the point if the recalculation is to be done from the pl then turn on the cursor and move it over the first point of the and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure either page press this will change the point to read if it is desired to recompute the arc intercept point then press if new arc intercept point is not desired then press was then kln will calculate an arc intercept point based on the present track of the aircraft over the the present track does not intercept the then kln will display no tin the scratchpad area of the the aircraft approaches the arc the kln will provide point alerting and turn anticipation to join the established on the arc the kln provides ance relative to the curved

flash when the difference between the cdi or hsi and the current desired track is greater than dme arcs have defined radials that serve as step down these points are not stored in the data to help you determine your position relative to these points along the the kln will display new value in the bottom right corner of the display on the nav this new bit of tion is denoted by the letters arc followed by three three numbers represent the current radial that you are on relative to the reference the arc radial is forced into this position when the aircraft is nm from the the display is shown in figure just watch this value and when it reads the same as one of the points you can descend as this particular example does not have such but there are quite few approaches that approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and performance may not be satisfactory if coupled the nav mode while flying the many autopilots were never designed to fly curved if autopilot performance is not tory while flying dme select the mode and keep changing the heading bug to keep the the aircraft approaches the end of the the kln will provide point alerting and turn anticipation to the next the aircraft is nm from fow the the kln will attempt to transition to the approach active since the dme arc procedure is flown entirely in the leg mode the only possible problem would be if the integrity monitoring did not check visual descent point is identified by the along track ance to the map to be when the aircraft reaches this point and the way environment is in it is possible to descend for missed approach is needed use the following missed approach calls for climb to and then left turn direct to the kln will not automatically sequence past the feet has been reached press the approach holding point will be the default direct to press to confirm the direct to point and proceed to the fow atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to obs mode will need to be selected to accomplish the ing if this is not done before the aircraft is nm from the kln will provide message reminding you to select the obs vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure another attempt at the approach is desired after itis necessary to manually change the active when the and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active point to the when you change from obs to make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active approach very rarely there will be problem with the integrity of the gps tem while you are conducting approaches with the kln in some cases the kln will determine that there will not be sufficient integrity monitoring for the leg between the and the or aim is not currently in these cases the kln will not go into the approach active mode and will present the ing not apr mode inhibited predict aim on th these cases you will not be able to finish the approach there is insufficient integrity the th page provides means for you to predict when aim will be to perform aim prediction on the th page two pieces of ation are the first is the location that the prediction will be for and the second is the time for the destination point by be the missed point of an approach loaded in the flight if there is no approach in the flight then the default point is the last point in the active flight of course it is possible for you to enter any point in this time used for the aim prediction will be the current eta to the destination airport or the this time is automatically updated by the kln so there is usually no need to enter if you are making aim calculation for planning it is also possible to enter time in this an important point about this time is that the time used for aim prediction is always in the future and limited to hours from the present for if the time is now and the time entered for the eta is then the prediction will be made for the next day not one hour approaches and and to perform manual aim the left outer and inner knobs to select the th the cursor will be over the aim the desired point identifier by using the inner and outer knobs just like you do for any other point the desired point identifier is entered press press again the point information is cursor will now be over the eta use the inner knob to enter the desired note that the current time zone is displayed next to the eta use the outer knob to move the cursor over the minutes use the inner and outer knobs to select tens of minutes and single utes as when the desired time is selected press aim

instrument and stars terminal arrival by procedures stored in the data base can only be considered accurate as long as the data base is even though the data base contains sid and star there is lot of information that is not included in the data the paper chart is still the primary source of for many procedures require the aircraft to fly to certain along heading until intercepting and many other procedures that the kln can not automatically many procedures require pilot action to ensure that the proper path is flown over the the main purpose of loading sid or star into the active flight plan is to provide you with quick way of loading potentially large number of and star procedures can be as challenging to fly as some approaches therefore it is mandatory that you are comfortable with the operation of the kln before attempting to fly sid and star in flight plan operation and the obs mode should be second nature to are some procedures in the world that not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base and therefore the points that make up these procedures would have to be entered it is good preflight practice ensure that the kln tains anticipated procedures for the and star procedures are stored with the airport for which sid and star procedures are accessed through the apt if there are both and stars for given then there will be two apt one to select sid and the other to select this is indicated by it is also possible to have only sid or only star in which case there is only one apt approaches and and sid and star procedures are defined in three the parts are the sid or star name transition and runway specific component rw the apt pages lead you through the selection selecting sid use the following procedure to select some steps may not be necessary depending on the procedure that you wish to for this the porte nine departure from san francisco international will be select on one of the airport

flight then the kln will ask to add this point to the active flight gives the actions required to fly this selecting star the steps required to select star are very similar to those required to select the only difference is the order of the steps to define the star and where the star is loaded into the flight the steps required to define acton four arrival with the wink tion serve as an example of how to select this star is to the worth international airport select dfw on one of the airport pages if you are operating from an active flight plan you can use the act page for dfw by scanning

departure loaded into the flight plan in section will be remember that was selected meaning that the procedure is applicable to both runways and the fellows transition was also this procedure is one of the more difficult that you are likely to come most procedures are not this but this sid serves as good example for what steps to take when you encounter difficult fly this procedure use the following steps and refer to the chart this sid the sid as described in section procedure states and proceed via sfo the dme fix at or above to accomplish this of the put the kln into the obs mode

was originally conceived and implemented by the united states department of defense the system able to all civilian users free of gps provides extremely precise and time satellites are not as is the case with weather and television that each satellite is not above fixed spot on the earth all the but rather is continuously moving across the in each satellite completely orbits the earth two times per department of defense imposes an intentional accuracy of the gps this degradation is known as selective availability when sa is only military users have access to full gps for civilian position accuracy is degraded to no worse than at the time of this selective availability is on therefore accuracy is ly of the position determining the technique used to determine position is fundamentally very the complicated part is accounting for and correcting all the possible errors in the gps receiver is able to determine the time it takes radio to travel from the satellite to the gps since this radio signal travels at the speed of light statute miles per the time delay can very easily be used to determine the distance from given if measurements are taken from four satellites three satellites and an input from an aircraft the receiver can identify its position very appendix appendix for the gps receiver might determine that it is miles from satellite miles from satellite and miles from satellite at the same the aircraft altimeter might be indicating an altitude of feet there is only one point in space that satisfies these four data signals two of the primary types of signals that the gps satellites broadcast are almanac and ephemeris these signals enable the gps receiver to quickly lock on to the satellites in the receiver would have to look for each of the satellites to determine which ones could be data is very crude data which describes the orbital position of the each of the satellites transmits the almanac data for all so gps receiver has only to listen to one satellite in order to know which satellites are the at that particular almanac data is good for about six so when you turn the receiver then back on month it will know what satellites to look data is very precise data which each satellite transmits tell the gps receiver exactly where it is and what its orbital will be for about the next four each satellite transmits its own unique ephemeris appendix not to gps system the gps system is composed of three the the control and the user space segment consists of the star satellites which orbit the earth at an altitude of nautical the satellite orbits are very precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the gps system hours every there are almost always more than six satellites in view from anywhere on control segment consists of network of and control the master control station is located in colorado all satellite data which is collected by the other ground stations is assimilated and analyzed at colorado based on these ephemeris updates as tem clock are sent to the satellites through radio transmitters at the ground these ground stations are located at kwajalein of hawaii in the central pacific diego garcia the indian and ascension the south atlantic an owner of gps you can now claim to be member of the gps user gps has many users and and more are being dreamed up all the not only are aircraft using gps so are military systems and and personal automobiles and transport trucks use intelligent transportation or to find their and track their some biologists attach gps receivers to animals to monitor their movement and migration geologists even use gps to track the movement of ers and to analyze plate tectonics of the an exciting new technology as we move into the autonomous integrity monitoring is function that every gps receiver must continuously perform to assure an accurate one characteristic of the gps space and control segments is that they instantly fix satellite if it sending misleading positioning for this gps receiver rely on the gps satellites to tell it when there is the words indicate that the gps kln appendix appendix on can detect an inaccuracy in the gps it does this by using distance measurements from as many satellites as possible to check the consistency of the position is called an position there are not enough satellites in view to assure the position the kln notifies the five measurements with good geometry positions of the are needed to provide this means that at least five satellites or four satellites and pressure altitude input from the altimeter are required assure aim if this check shows some sistency in the the kln notifies the user that other navigation sources should be used to the sometimes the receiver is unable to assure the position to enough accuracy for the phase of due to the location of the satellites at that availability is very seldom difficulty when in the en route terminal phases of the allowable limits are much tighter when approach is performed with kln for this the kln other page allows the pilot to enter time and and the gps receiver will predict if aim will be available to shoot the see section for more information about the aim prediction receiver the kln and kln use an honeywell gps receiver known as the gps it was dubbed this way because it is cal in size to an everyday credit and its faster acquisition time than previous the gps receiver has eight parallel which means each channel can continuously track for continuous tracking of up to eight gps the parallel receiver design has several

report is intended for those who require an understanding of the brief overview of how the project research and analysis were and list of the significant findings and readers and front line managers who may need or want more details of the research and and complete listing of findings and recommendations can refer to the full report that the noncompliance problem approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for aviation accounting annually for approximately percent of all flight safety foundation study of years of runway excursions determined that percent could have been avoided with decision to go in other percent of all accidents could potentially be prevented by going it is generally felt that an unstable approach is the primary cause of landing within this just over half of the landing excur followed fully stable in these the flight became unstable only during critical industry policy designed to help prevent such accidents is the and the collective industry performance of complying with policies is extremely poor approximately percent of unstable approaches result in policy why is critical policy designed to prevent the most common type of accident ignored by flight and why is that policy not being managed effectively by improving the compliance rate holds tremendous potential in re approach and landing accidents the itself is not without there is an increased risk in loss of control events during compared to exposure with all other phases of it follows that we should only go around when the risk associated with an unstable approach is greater than the risk associated with what is that and how do we minimize exposure to only those that are really the flight safety foun making and execution project was launched to research and answer the question are we so poor at complying with established it was also intended to improve our understanding of the risks associated with executing and to make com to improve compliance and mitigate risks with the maneuver the full report includes complete find strategies and recommendations for industry corrective and future work as it is meant as source for the development of operator refer

research and analysis of decision making have been conducted primarily from the psychosocial science perspective to gain an understanding of the psychological drivers of and to identify corrective steps that can be based on this is the first industry of its type for this specific the presage group conducted the research and based on its situational model of nine distinct or from two global studies via one survey analyzed the psychology of noncompliance by flight and the other examined the psychology of actions in handling company detailed analysis can be found in the full for the

overall level of risk of each event were analyzed and characterized by review each event was assigned to one of three categories according to the degree of risk presented by the high risk moderate risk and in the two six safety issues were identified with respect to the ia and conduct of each most of the bearing events were associated with single but five events were associated with two each event also was assigned one of three loss of controlled flight into terrain or midair significant findings an effective policy has three main it is well thought out and clearly written to balance the needs of safety and company management handles the policy and company front line aware is such that the policy is carried out research revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the operator and employee significant findings the collective industry norm is to accept the pli of despite empirical data that indicate this is the most common contributor to the industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable approaches as the sole means to reduce even though empirical data show that unstable approaches affect less than half of runway overall awareness of ala risks and of the impact those risks have on approach and landing safety is management is generally disengaged from noncompliance and has low awareness of the impact it has on perception of risk is pilots do not see current policy criteria as realistic for the operational effective decision making in flight deck com cation is although considered normal flight eu are as reported by flight one in has potentially hazardous such as an aircraft for there are variable techniques and depending on the point during the approach when the around procedures and training do not adequately address many of these pilot experience in the aircraft type affects including complex controller radio can affect recommendations it is evident that the state of noncompliance has been steady for many years and will remain steady unless changes are first and the industry must improve its awareness of the shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is the cultural shift will be easier if the industry shifts as opposed to individual attacking the issue on their as several are already as stated three key attributes of an effective policy the policy makes operational sense to both the employees who execute it and those who manage the policy is managed effectively to level that satisfies company and the employees who should follow the policy are very aware of that policy and the environment in which it is as the following recommendations touch upon these key more detailed recommendations can be found in the full strategic recommendations for decision making include the ensure the policy makes sense update the stable approach definition and stable ap height to maximize their relevance among flight and their manageability among separate the stable approach definition and criteria from criteria to improve aware that these are two distinct aspects of and that decision making is viable beyond the defined approach this separation does not imply that these two distinct areas cannot meet at points throughout the approach and it is intended for developers of standard operating pro dures and communication procedures to break the psychological attachment of these two manage the policy

enhance situational awareness aware to heighten flight awareness throughout the approach and landing policy and procedural communication minimizing the subjectivity of decision making for the decision maker the pilot flying or to mitigate those components of situ awareness that compromise the risk assessment and each recommendation helps improve the psychological riv that affect good decision and it is this ec that the recommendations were specifically designed to although all strategic recommendations are important and should be implemented as part of holistic few are worth if an operator has the means to install automated stable approach and land alerting it should be these systems address many of the psychological issues associated with noncompliance and could be the single most effective way to improve management must be more involved in managing the an area where management has been very much key steps to be taken by management are to set compliance rate targets consistent with safety management system prin and to investigate and follow up on each approach that continues to an unstable flight crew situational awareness needs to be improved primarily through better communication throughout the approach and which can be achieved largely through active communication techniques as part of standard strategic execution ensure that training and awareness pri reflect different execution risk review procedures and men to maximize their clarity and ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitoring during landing and as with any significant program and effects should be closely monitored by pri audit programs such as flight data analysis line operations safety audits or international air trans association operational safety audits action taken in light of the findings and it is appar that revisions are required to flight safety elements of stabilized and safe landing guidelines analysis indicates there are facets of that guidance that are not optimal for effective decision making and that may encourage for approaches that may be of very low when this report was being the analysis for such revisions had already taken but the project review committee recommended an operational trial before changes in the guidelines are formally appendices and for flight safety foun stabilized approach and for industry and safe landing for industry project conclusion the problem of policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the greatest threat to flight safety and the po impact of improvement in compliance is no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go the industry must improve its awareness of the to accomplish shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is attain the cultural shift will be much easier if the in shifts as opposed to individual companies taking individual several companies already have chosen to go it alone on this the project accomplished the goals of the document that outlined the terms of flight safety safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight and to consider the safety risk with and ensure that the transfer of risk is there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of the not all envisioned products have been and this is noted in the report as work yet to be done by flight safety background presentation in flight safety international advisory committee was briefed about concerns that often were not being conducted when an unstable approach occurred below the stable approach height the ensuing discussion concluded in agreement that the issue should be studied the eu advisory committee began its own discussion related to the lack of unstable approach policy the risk of the maneuver and what effect air traffic services providers could have on the these discussions led the foundation to look more deeply into the empirical data supporting such failure to conduct is the number one risk factor in approach and landing accidents and the number one cause of runway excursions the year in recent analyses of data from through indicate that percent of all accidents are runway and that they are the most common type of accident the year in unstable approaches occur on to percent of all and to percent of flight crews whose airplanes are in this state continue the approach to landing the year in evidence based in of approach and landing accidents and serious one of several studies conducted by flight safety approach and landing accident reduction task force and published by the foundation in the task force con an analysis of accidents and incidents that occurred from through the task force found that was initiated in only percent of the occurrences and said that the evidence analysts expected the initiation of higher number of in safety foundation alar task approximately percent of all accidents are alas one analysis concluded that more than percent of alas would have been preventable if the crew had decided to go around the year in simply potentially about half of all accidents could be prevented with decision to go no other single de can have such an impact on the overall aviation accident although all of these studies are somewhat the consistencies from study to study indicate the problem is real and is of the magnitude the studies around decision can yield great but what about the risks associated with the maneuver there is no shortage of informative studies that have ana what occurred during alas and what factors contrib to the no known study has examined flight crew decision making from psychological perspective to determine why some crews continued with an unstable knowingly violating company and why th elected to go what are the drivers of intentional noncompliance with critical safety the alar task analysis of approach and landing accidents and serious incidents identified professional decision as the most re casual occurring in percent of the another form of poor decision making or continuing an approach when conditions suggest otherwise accounted for percent of all occurrences safety foundation alar task more questions arise about the or of company management in these if the data have been consistent for many why have managers not been able to correct the with such low industry compliance some basic questions about role need to be are they aware of the noncompliance and if then why have they been unable to mitigate or improve compliance with established if they are not concerned with the poor compliance why man issues were not cited in any of the conclusions of the alar task final of fatal approach and landing in the task conclusions of related study of approach and landing ac and serious management fail was identified as circumstantial factor in percent of the occurrences safety foundation alar task based on these better awareness of the and new flight safety foundation initiated the and execution project it was designed as joint with each committee focusing on one specific aspect of the the focused on decision and the focused on the performance of the decision making flight crew methodology and information collection the presage group was commissioned by flight safety foun to conduct research and analysis on the psychology of factors contributing to intentional the basis for much of the following comes from two studies conducted by presage one that analyzed the psychology of flight crew decision making during unstable and another that analyzed the psychology of company management decision making pertaining to addressing noncompliance with com safety policies jamieson and why are policies the ology of de making during unstable jamieson and why are policies the view from the airline although the issue extends beyond unstable the studies were conducted on this phase of flight as data were readily attainable from flight psychological survey was developed that used unique questioning and experimental methodologies to understand the causation of compliant versus noncompliant flight crew decision these techniques included assess experiences using series of questions designed to explore the psychological precursors of risk assessment and decision second survey was designed to assess the beliefs and experiences of airline ag and safety and operational personnel regarding unstable approaches and how they are managed at their host to fully understand the systemic roots and dynamics of noncompliance with unstable approach policies across the the results of the managers study were compared with those of the parallel flight crew flight crew event recall study segmentation in this segment of the we asked pilots to recall recent specific instances of unstable at or below sah we asked for the last instance they had this special task elicited detailed descriptions of their experiences during the minutes leading up to and including decision on whether to call for these experiences include

accordance with the recommendations made by members of the and and other expert advisory team the pilots were divided into those who only experienced continuing to land with an unstable approach those who only experienced those who had experienced both and unstable approach pilots in this group were randomly as to one of two groups to recall scenario in which they had flown an unstable approach but did not call for or to recall this random experimental assignment allowed us to identify objective and psychological situational factors associated with noncompliance with policies re decision pilots

experiment was included in this and we report some findings but the details are too mer to fully describe this experiment was designed to uncover the environmental and physical instability param that influence perceptions of the risks inherent in flying unstable and to examine when their attention to these parameters affects their judgments about when to call for in this pilots were pre with hypothetical flight scenario in which they were randomly assigned to receive variations in the severity of the risk associated with wind runway braking action and runway they were then asked at what degree of on five different flight those variations would cause them to call for pilots were instructed to report on their likelihood of calling for based on their own personal risk not those of their companies or of the on this set of five flight and to do so at different this allowed us to infer where on the flight path different risk factors become personally salient and important as drivers of judgments to go and how these factors might the objective was to determine whether there was basic alignment between about when there is need to call for and general policies about when these instabilities necessitate such in case of evidence of any gaps between these our goal was to use these data to guide realistic recommendations about changes in policy that might bring them into alignment while ensuring that safety would not be to the extent that pilots do not see current policies as constituting set of legitimately unsafe they are likely to ignore such standard procedures and engage in potentially pli flight this was an experimentally based attempt to explore pilot perceptions of what should constitute the conditions to go in their experienced and to begin to develop view about whether such beliefs could be or should be incorporated into policy guidance and sops in way that would help ensure safe pilot respondent sampling respondents to this survey were solicited through direct communication with safety personnel at various pilot and and airlines as well as through various social media the goal was to invite and administer the online survey to as many pilots

unstable approach criteria and as well as those responsible for quality control of flight op series of questions regarding their views of the safety procedures and organizational cultures with which unstable approaches and occur in their own airline we asked such managers about the rates of compliance with unstable approach policies that they believed their airlines as well as the compliance rates experienced by the commercial industry as beyond this basic we asked whether they were satisfied with their performance on li with their unstable policies and and whether they thought them about their perceptions of the clarity and appropriateness of these policies and about their beliefs that they had the support support and organizational to manage their and about their overall assessment of how urgently they believed that the risks perceived in their rates needed to be addressed at the content of the entire survey was thoroughly commented upon and amended in ac with the

irrespective of whether their role included policy development or the considerable efforts that we made in our outreach and engagement strategy for the survey garnered unique visits to the survey we consider this number of hits to be very indicating that the engagement strategy drove meaningful number of airline managers to the of those only completed the response rate low in both absolute and relative to the rate of participation among pilots who were asked to complete much longer and more demanding this low response rate we the first evidence pointing toward disengagement with the topic of unstable policy and procedures among airline flight operations personnel at the managerial this is especially true when we consider that the original criterion for inclusion in our final analysis stipulated that respondents must be in position to develop and influence unstable policies and procedures at their airlines by virtue of their authority to recommend or make based on this inclusion criterion and an analysis of reported roles and we achieved sample of only qualified spon to increase the sample size for we widened the sample frame to include those respondents responsible for quality control of flight operations at their even if they did not have policy development thorough comparison of the latter group with the original target revealed no systematic differences in their survey justifying their inclusion in the final the reports the results from managers per of all survey respondents and percent of survey site this low response rate essen disallowed us from analyzing data for experimental task of determining personal around thresholds for unstable approach risk among similar to the threshold in light of the low response caveat must be issued for all other results that we report that is because the normative response to the survey invitation among managers worldwide was to choose not to we must question whether this was valid and reliable sample of that the although based on this small are highly suggestive of trends in perspectives on unstable policies and while we are unsure if the sample in our intuition tells us that any sample if would tend toward having surveyed managers who are more aware and concerned about the issue than those who are less if this is these results may more likely the degree of awareness and concern about unstable around

dispositional pilot tendencies and preferences associated with flying unstable approaches of present in the aviation and we will also point out in the data how such pilot sposi factors may additionally contribute to noncompliance with it is our belief that the best way to present the findings is to describe how noncompliant behavior is function of process influenced by the aircraft and environmental factors that shape their situational awareness competencies in encoding and inter the cues they receive about these aircraft and their personal perceptions of risk and risk tolerance that and their appetite for appropriate col conversation about risk during the approach as an input to decision it is from both the responses within each of these four classes of as well as the interactions between the two that complete scrip psychological profile for noncompliance pilot situational awareness profile situational awareness of his or her in all its is the psychological prerequisite for pilot to judge risk and then to make decision to maintain compliance and safety in light of that this study used the situational awareness model for measuring and interpreting the psychological and social factors that col make up situational recall that within this situational awareness comprises nine distinct but interconnected and seamless aspects of much of our discussion will be framed around how each of these aspects influences singly and in concert with one to remain compliant rather than note in passing that the presage model classifies with an average percent accuracy whether pilots are describing an unstable approach and landing or percent for unstable approaches and percent for based only on its psychosocial measurements and excluding any knowledge of the objective factors present in the unstable approach scenarios this means that our assessment of the experience of aware as we have measured does good job of predicting behavior far beyond percent chance level of the results of this study as that on all nine situational awareness unstable approach pilots were significantly less aware than pilots in the moments leading up to and including their around decision making that they were less aware of their emotional responses to less able to anticipate more overconfident in their ability to compensate for the and in less agreement with company in other the unstable pilots scored much lower than did the pilots on every facet of situational awareness seven of these nine differ held up statistically to the more rigorous analysis that compared just the experimentally assigned and un approach pilots with one and eight of the nine differences between the experimentally assigned and unstable approach pilots were even more pronounced when comparing the and it is meaningful to does this awareness shape perception of put situational awareness competencies directly affect his or her perceptions and assessment of the lower the degree of threat that pilots associate with instability and environmental factors the perception of which is directly informed by their situ awareness the lower the significance that pilots will place on the contributing factors and the less risky they will perceive the situation to table shows this with unstable pilots reporting much lower assess of the riskiness and unmanageability of their bili than the spreading activation effect of situational awareness competencies we have asserted that the nature of the facets of situational awareness means that decline in one facet will produce rapid deleterious effect on the this becomes clear when we consider the data relevant to this activation of situational awareness for this effect is evident among the unstable approach pilot whose lower scores on their gut feel for threats as well as on actually seeing the leave them vulnerable to minimizing both their assessment of the potential threat of aircraft instability and their ability to see the threat of instability as risk to be managed the natural outcome is that more unstable approach pilots are unstable at sah corollary of these lower aware scores is that unstable approach pilots also score lower in their ability to leverage crew relationships to maximize compliance and table shows that unstable approach pilots are more likely to minimize efforts to consider discuss with their members both instability factors path aircraft ref sink rate and land and environmental factors contaminated runway and occupied it is the culminating effect of the aforementioned reduced awareness competencies that leaves the unstable approach pilots vulnerable to adopting mental model that minimizes the risk of instability and reduces their attention to as the results for the instruments and and the indicate functional and hierarchical in table unstable approach pilots are more tolerant of deviations from operational limits and procedures and less compliant with requirements that they perform all checklists and standard as these pilots commit to continuing with an unstable they minimize what their professional experience could offer in executing what the sop states table note on or critical in other when an unstable approach pilot is not tuned into salient from his or her experience he increases the risk profile of the operation and denies himself the opportunity to correctly adjust or compensate for the operational threat table to or compensatory the finding that unstable approach pilots more often than pilots report being unstable at sah confirms this missed opportunity to remain compliant in concert with the former pattern is the finding that unstable approach pilots were more comfortable operating on the margins of the safety envelope in table note the lower scores on the or empirical which translates to greater tolerance for risk that is seen to be in table note the assessment of the instability as if pilot is paying less attention to his situational awareness he would likely also shut himself off from avail such as by using interpersonal relationships to protect operational safety and remain compliant table note each other or relational there are number of significant findings at the level of this construct that tell meaningful most notable among these is that unstable approach pilots are relatively more likely than pilots to feel crew to to perceive lack of crew support for possible to feel discomfort in being challenged and in challenging and to feel inhibited about calling for because of the authority structure in the pilots are about four times more likely than unstable approach pilots percent to report recalling that an individual was prompting the crew to initiate ref is reference landing speed the evidence is clear that rather than leveraging the crew relationships as tool for safe decision crew expectations and communication had even compounding this risk profile are the findings that unstable approach pilots score lower on support for and that fewer than percent of unstable pilots believed they would be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to land at the same maintaining that their criteria for when to execute are not realistic in the for the unstable approach there is less to company and an incentive structure that or is at least not seen to unstable approaches that are continued to these results describe situation that creates internal conflict for the unstable approach at least in when they express regret for their decision to continue an unstable approach to landing compared with unstable approach pilots rated their flight outcomes less believed less often that they had made the right believed much more strongly than pilots that they should not have made the decisions they did agreed more strongly that they had engaged in needless interpretation of results the results appear to imply conflicting message from the unstable approach pilot on one unstable ap pilots regret their decisions to continue an unstable approach and knowing that they have taken and at the same they believe that the criteria for are realistic the latter may in rationalization of their noncompliant and one that they carry forward into the next such unstable approach at the moment of the potential for noncompliant behavior based on these beliefs is very while the chance seems remote that pilots may anticipate regret for not calling for and may have that anticipation inhibit their tendency to continue the unstable consider the psychosocial factors affecting unstable ap pilots at the time they need to make an appropriate decision on whether to go they have lowered sense of situational awareness across most which has led them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their assessment of their process re little help from protective crew norms and and there is no real disincentive to fly unstable the expected company response to that these are the ingredients of recipe for the of to contaminate this component of aviation safety this term refers to the development of mode of which is passively support tolerated approved by its owners and in some regula once entrenched within given this new power and authority can considerably influence as evidenced in the challenger and columbia space shuttle tragedies supportive evidence from the results of this study indicates that in their acceptance of the noncom unstable approach pilots have surrendered level of situational awareness competency that directly impacts accurate risk assessment and full compliance with sops as in new roles and incentives have come to displace some of the influence that situational awareness should have in proximity to risk assessment and decision pilot thresholds for going around another area for discussion is the second experimental part of the which asked pilots to describe their risk toler thresholds for various given set of flight and environmental we found that braking action had particularly large impact on pi perception of the degrees of instability that warrant call for on the thresholds for calling for varied as function of both height agl and the instability parameter they were considering as reason for going for several of these instability fac the perceived threshold occurred well below ft agl to in pilots said that they should be on profile

warranted to fully explain the he of broad noncompliance with policies and the inherent risks associated with the percent of unstable approaches that continue unstable can only be indirectly inferred from the present based on pilot this study mainly assessed the logi characteristics and in situ of pilots who choose to continue unstable approaches to landing versus those who make decisions to go the study does not segregate the various unstable approach scenarios into classes of presenting high or low objective while it is understood that not all unstable approaches carry the same level of

this determination flows directly from his level and type of situational awareness and the mental models of risk he constructs based on that to the extent that pilot has lowered situational awareness whether caused by acute aspects of the situation such as high workload or chronic aspects of the cultural environment such as lessened acceptance of the policy guidance or generally few challenges to cockpit command he will be less sensitive to relevant situational awareness cues and therefore be more likely to continue an unstable approach irrespective of the inherent objective risks associated

insufficient to cover all as tony an psychologist and author of several books on human has guidance is ef when it is thought out and written explained commonly understood and voluntarily complied too many rules lead to cynicism and because not all situations can be rules cannot be developed to cover all possible in these the human ability to adapt to changing situations is just as important as the implementation of effective policies and need to reach point where two types of professional discipline become kern first is the organizational discipline to keep the rules to an absolute minimum and enforce the rules across the the second is the personal discipline to comply company too he policies and procedures conflict with cultural and when that who studies noncompliance knows that culture will nearly always trump at least in the long not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent and based on the different objective environments from approach to there can be conflict between these and the singular prescriptive company as in by the disagreement with company policy once pilot is outside the prescriptive box of policy and has made the decision to continue the he is left to his individual risk assessment whatever that may to determine his personal risk thresh without robust prescriptive policies that allow for some open analysis of risk and decision making can offer solution to these cases in which the objective and stated policies do not align for if policy says that flight crew must go around in all cases if the aircraft has not touched down within seven seconds of crossing the the pilots likely would view the importance of that policy dif depending on the conditions of the they would likely be more in agreement with the policy for an approach to shorter runway that was contaminated and had slight tail wind than for an approach to dry runway with slight head if the policy is written to allow some from the under some guiding pilots will agree with the policy more in this example of the short contaminated the briefing should include statement that there would be no modification of the whereas in the case of the long the briefing may include an allowance to increase that frame to it is important to em that these allowances should follow guided process laid out by the and that the policies remain mi in this guiding principles may be that all members agree in advance of the and that the landing distance available exceeds the landing distance required by predetermined allowing some guided decision pilots will be more likely to trust and voluntarily comply with written in part because those policies will address the highly variable environments in which pilots work and also because the pilots will recognize that their expertise and knowledge are being used in the an increased agree on policy leads to increased and to the normalization of stable approach and decision points it is also worth discussing the relationship between the stable approach the sah safe landing guidelines and decision as the decision to go around remains possible up until the point of deploy and policies usually indicate that should be initiated any time an aircraft becomes unstable below the then it follows that the decision point to go around defines the beginning of zone in which is mandatory if the approach is thrust reverser deployment defines the end of that most sop channel flight crews to specific decision points to determine if they are in state in which it is safe to continue the these points are before deploy these sop callout points are usually linked with leaving no formal stable for an extended period of time when is active calls selection of calls that are mandatory for all varying objective force communication between or conditional on the other are only communicated if stimulated by the weakness in the passive call process is if call is not it could be for reasons other than the required objective condition being for if member did not see the call would not be in member might choose not to make call for varying such as subjective interpretation of the condition or fear of the cockpit authority active calls are always as they force their absence indicates another such as pilot many responsive by the pilot flying at sah or minimum approach height suggest what will what they are going to do for example suggestive calls like to influence the decision to land and close the window for the decision to go even though may be required if the flight becomes unstable very late in the approach or repeated and escalated calls allow condition to remain alive in the conscious mind of the on the other single callout for example at sah raises situational awareness about the condition at that as situational awareness is it can change improving or and that are designed to continue as long as the condition exists help to maintain awareness of that escalation of the calls can heighten take the example of from enhanced ground proximity warning systems and other terrain awareness and warning systems the system alerts the flight crew to pending condition and continues with until the condition is no longer the same effect can be com in unstable approach by both members and automated as the onset of approach instabilities can occur at any even late in the landing phase keys to safe the window for decision that the deci is not made at defined point at the the decision points for are separate and distinct from the stable approach and as procedure designers can separate the two to maximize decision in reviewing the fsf alar task force elements of stabilized safety foundation alar task we discover somewhat conflicting mes it states that approaches in instrument meteorological conditions must be stabilized before reaching ft visual meteorological conditions they must be stabilized before ft agl in precision and visual approaches on the other the document indicates that descent below ft is acceptable in maneuver for circling and specifies that should be level on final when the aircraft reaches ft above airport in other on precision guided the documented guidance is that the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl in and on circling guided the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet it is not difficult for pilot to conclude if it is acceptable and safe to fly off final approach profile until ft agl on then it is also safe to fly an approach to ft off although that by objective objective is that which does not require an individual to interpret information based on his or her ex or it is usually factual objective feedback in the cockpit minimizes the need for interpretation and can lead to more consistent and faster decision stating fact instead of interpreting making judgment or forming an opinion helps mini the effect of steep authority gradient in the such as may exist when first officer is paired with an example of objective feedback is that by an automated system such as in this there is little subjective analysis done by the pilot when re to automated and the response can be quick and this in why an automated energy approach monitoring and alerting can be very effective in improving another example of the use of objective feedback is the use of radio altimeter automatic rather than interpreting radio altimeter readout readouts can fluctuate due to terrain and must be observed and on the other are only in the absence of an automated energy management after pilots cross the they usually subjectively or how much runway has passed or how much from they decide whether to conduct if the pilot monitoring times the threshold crossing and then makes procedural call at the point where touchdown should occur or should this call constitutes objective feedback to the pilot flying and makes clear that some either touchdown or should occur should have driven by policy and minimizing subjectivity in pro is an objective that procedural designers should make every effort to management decision making overview of results in table we present data for of their awareness if their specific estimates both the and their own rates of compliance with unstable when asked whether they knew what the compliance rate only percent of managers said that they of those who claimed fewer were willing to estimate managers percent of the offered an estimated which averaged percent compliance times the true and was highly variable percent to standard only one in seven managers reported rate that was considered percent of the actual percent the perception of rates may not be the central concern of managers working to police their own noncompliance with unstable but this general lack of awareness and accuracy in estimating the true even among those claiming cannot be when asked whether they knew what their own compliance rate percent of managers said that they although only percent offered an estimate of that majority of managers are largely unaware of unstable compliance and noncompliance even within their own of the managers who offered the mean rate was percent again with large range to and standard de these managers are estimating li rates at their companies that on more than percent above the industry average as they perceive it if their estimates were they would indicate that the companies were outperforming the indus as whole by more than tenfold percent what is most striking is the tremendous degree of variability in the revealing that there is very little common basis of even among those claiming knowledge of the rates at their own in our it is highly unlikely that this is an objective for perceptions to have truly tracked with these data would mean that companies are ex the full range of compliance from zero to it is hard to imagine that this is the and hard to imagine how this could result in an average that hovers at percent year after table manager of awareness

companies had flight data of the managers at those reported on their rate of compliance as indicated by their these managers are not the same who reported on their flight operations compliance rates in answer to the prior one in eight managers reported compliance rates broadly in line with the industry average less than at the opposite end of the percent re rates above the mean rate was again with wide range and variability to with standard deviation of that such spread of compliance rates is reported by this sample is we believe it reflects not only general lack of awareness among managers of the rates of compliance with their own policies strongly indicated by the incidence of but perhaps also specific errors within their although objective data are this assertion can only be by again assuming that compliance rates exceeding percent are rare in the we cannot rule this out because although we have access to we lack objective verification of company compliance if the rates are it suggests that our sample is drawn from an unusually compliant subsample of in that the lack of awareness effects across the manager study suggests that awareness could be less than we begin with some overall observations about the data in table on each of the three the norma response is to not and only minority of ag claim to or rate of as managers and compliance rates for their own companies more frequently than they do for the industry as probably because they are less familiar with their perception of the compliance is out of line with six times greater than the actual percent rate of managers tell us as an aggregate sample that they believe their companies are outperforming the rate of compliance by to on this is the equivalent of compliance rate at least times greater than the as if we assume that these com have more realistic unstable policy compliance rate below percent rate span still up to three times better than the current industry this would mean that only about one in seven managers to in the survey reported an accurate rate for their own whether their reporting was based on personal estimate or on their fda if we give them more and allow that their companies actually achieved rates upward of then high accuracy of rates of report is still shared by fewer than of the seven in simply do not know their own or if they do they their compliance rates by more than these kinds of perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence and complacency about unstable policy manager situational awareness profile manager perceptual measures of situational awareness managers completed questions to assess their beliefs and behaviors concerning their rates and unstable the results are in table the responses were subjected to an empirical factor analysis to determine how they merged in minds and to provide simpler summary categories for presentation and three of the four factors to emerge had more than one associated one factor was assessment of whether the respondent debriefed flight crew who had violated the com unstable factor theme was the perceived support that the spon received from their companies in understanding and managing the six questions this factor com were averaged and called factor comprised questions assessing the degree to which managers thought that their unstable policies and procedures and their associated operational definitions were clear and responses to five questions were averaged to create an index of factor was an expression of ag concerns about and sense of urgency surrounding their it was formulated by averaging responses to the five questions shown in table and named in addition to the four we present overall measures recorded by managers of their satisfaction and the per

weaker than the index score of overall satisfaction with compliance rates associated with their flight while slightly was still on the positive side of the in concert with this pattern perhaps because of these perceptions and judgments man slightly disagreed overall that there was cause for concern or need for action to improve their taken these absolute scores indicate that ag are not completely

driven first by lower perceived threat scores and secondarily by higher perceptions reflected in the perceived effectiveness these differential patterns were although the overall measures of satisfaction and effectiveness were on narrowly agreed that they all flight crews who have broken our policies on operational procedures for taken at its per disagree that all flight crews are high absolute number of managers who admit to less than complete debriefing while this may seem like high the fact that the statement was phrased as as opposed to company may account for the to examine the relationships between positive perceptions of organizational compliance fac and low concern with their we studied responses from only those managers who had reported on their compliance rates that of all those claiming knowledge of this we divided them into managers whose reports were generally close to the industry average of accept anyone who reported rate of less than percent into group we labeled reporting what looked like reasonably accurate compared with the industry base all other managers reported compliance rates from to percent and were placed in comparison group labeled reporting compliance rate not likely to be the results show that stating an rate of li is at significant statistical with higher scores on two of the five questions on the second factor of per the effectiveness index as and the single measure of effectiveness effective it is also correlated with lower scores on the perceived threat index and four of its five component while this pattern may seem obvious in it makes the point independent of the level of support perceived for ag rates were no differences on the perceived support the perception of the policies as effective and the threat as low may flow from basic lack of realistic knowledge or appraisal of the compliance if this causal effect is true that posi perceptions lead to low perceived threat then what is clearly indicated by these data is the need for raising about the industry norm of massive and dissemination of the own data identifying their internal rates of unstable around policy compliance and segmentation analysis to determine whether the sample included types of ag whose views of their compliance rate and performance were consistent with each other and also different from other identified we conducted traditional cluster analysis on this sample of managers agglomerative cluster based on euclidean due to the small sample we generated just two groups to and based the mathematics of this segmentation on variety of responses given in the this of consisted of the perception questions and the two overall measures of effectiveness and satisfaction all the measures presented in table not the resulting groups consisted of one whose members perceived high risk in their compliance rates risk and second group whose members had more moderate view risk the percent of ag who perceived high risk differed from the percent of perceivers on almost all measures in the and powerfully in both the statistical sense and the magnitude sense degree of statistical table shows that on of and on all three the high risk perceiver group showed pattern of higher concern and perceived lower satisfaction with their lower perceived policy and compliance presage situational awareness construct results for managers

risk perceiver types tended to see their company compliance rates as slightly perform relative to industry whereas low risk perceiver types reported that their companies were definitely outperforming the industry compliance high risk types were more likely to claim that prior to the they had been aware of the industry rate and of their own company flight rate of those in the high risk perceiver group were more likely to report being in roles in which they had less power to effect more often saying they were able only to offer com added to the fact that members of the high risk perceiver group were three times less likely than those in the low risk perceiver group to say their compliance rates were between and percent suspect number and more than four times as likely to say that their fda showed their rate was between zero and percent number more in line with industry norms picture emerges of group whose members are more realistic and appropriately anxious and concerned about their low rates of but who perhaps have little voice or power within the company to change policy or procedures they see as more likely to be or to offer new definition of what should constitute stable approach they see as overly how did these managers score on the presage indices of situational this situation presents clear instance of via of most policies and procedures surrounding unstable performance rates and their manage as our metrics are likely to show low absolute on scale of to with corresponding to high safety the first column of table which displays these scores for the overall shows this to be the in no case does the absolute score on any of our awareness metrics exceed the midscale of safety awareness is low in all of the awareness areas assessed by our we know in this instance that unstable noncompliance is major problem for the our measures of situational awareness are scored higher when this problem is recognized to be in the ap to scoring shown in table all measures are scored such that higher numbers indicate greater degree of realistic threat awareness and as higher situational awareness on our measures is associated with seeing the cur threat to be real anticipatory and the procedural measures used to compensate for it to be ad adjusting to the managers with higher situational awareness see their current procedures as re and the definitions of instability as too narrow scores on knowing the procedures and knowing the their experience high reliance on peri tells them there is and they feel more anxious and eager to take action against this safety threat gut feeling for because new plan is needed in the face of general lack of appreciation of the threat to compliance in their higher awareness is also associated with perception that their companies have little will to and are generally complacent about the sops in place to manage the threat relational and corporate support for as those with higher awareness also feel less support from and higher level of discomfort in approaching senior management to broach the with this understanding of our scoring methods in we examined the scores of the two groups the managers who reported compliance rate based on their fda that was than versus those who the compliance rate percent or we hypoth sized that more accurate awareness of the low rate of compliance would be associated with heightened sense of perceived threat and the felt need to com all aspects of the situational awareness we that managers who were aware of the actual low rate of compliance with unstable around policies at their airlines would receive higher scores on all nine of our metrics than their colleagues who were even if the magnitude of these scores was still low in absolute terms when compared to the scale in table it can be seen that on seven of our nine metrics of situational the hypothesis that the respondents would report greater situational awareness was supported at level of statistical reliability of percent or that if this experiment were repeated we would observe the same differences in of the only on the and each other were the levels of awareness similar for the two albeit at low absolute in those aware of the low compliance rates at their companies scored at or above the midscale on five of our metrics fec anticipatory and if minimum midscale threshold of situational awareness across majority of our measures was enough to trigger some the individuals in this group were close to reaching such trigger how note that this group constituted just percent of of our sample small minority coming to full aware of the table also shows results derived from cluster analysis on the presage metrics for the two groups those perceiving relatively high risk in their unstable around policies and rates percent of and those not generally perceiving such risks will be recalled these groups were designed for all managers in the irrespective of whether they claimed to or ventured to what their company compliance rate actually according to fda or in this all nine awareness factors are statistically reliably with five means above the midscale for the perception these results are more encouraging in terms of the complement of managers perhaps ready to act in this important area of as about of the sample shows signs of having reached threshold of aware that will trigger activity to manage this issue more safely in the near as demonstration of the effect that improved awareness in one area can have on overall situational we compared the situational awareness scores of all managers with the scores of the group whose members were aware of their internal company compliance rates figure shows the incremental benefit that awareness in one area can have across eight of the nine it is relevant to discuss the approach to monitoring unstable approach flight as many flight data monitoring programs are set to report only when more than one stable approach criterion is and in some to report only low level alert until three or more criteria are we see an indication from those responsible for the design of these programs that there is an acknowledged variability in the risk of unstable more there is an indication of on between the level of concern for low risk unstable approaches and the policy guidance for flight crews on those same which is to execute when one or more criteria are from the spec of the flight why should they be concerned about the risk of this level of unstable approaches if management is not concerned enough to want to be told about them or act on situational awareness of managers who knew company compliance rules feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures additional base score the presage group for flight safety foundation this is consistent with the results of both the pilot and management psychological industry sensing the conversation about reducing the risk of alas often drifts toward how to eliminate unstable even though the discussion begins with focus on rates of compliance with it is clear that there is larger with the existence of unstable despite the fact that the industry has reduced unstable approaches to percent or in an industry with such variable objective one must ask is the lowest attainable unstable approach it makes sense that an industry with almost nonexistent compliance with policies would be concerned about the small number of unstable approaches that if we turn the tables and consider for moment an industry with high rate of policy would there be as much concern about unstable and is the focus on eliminating unstable approaches the right strategy in reducing in flight safety year study of runway conducted in we see that percent of the landing excursions were las as and of percent followed stable approach that became unstable during the landing only percent of the landing excursions followed unstable overruns accounted for the other percent of landing percent of overruns followed stable and percent followed unstable in percent of landing runway excursions followed stable and an number per followed unstable separate analysis by boeing of runway overrun excursions from to found that percent followed stable and drawing from concentrated effort to reduce figure overall manager situational awareness scores feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures the presage group for flight safety foundation number of unstable approaches that become unstable in the approach phase will address less than half of all landing on the other reliable making operation has the potential to affect most landing ex those occurring after flights that become unstable during the approach or landing strategy to continue improving the stable approach rate in addition to improving the compliance rate is the most com the point of this discussion is to illustrate that the tendency to focus only on eliminating unstable approaches will not address large portion of and that improving the compliance rate holds the greater in an fsf runway safety initiative determined that gap existed in alar tool kit risk reduction which did not address the landing phase the foundation then developed safe landing guidelines keys to safe which are intended to be used by aircraft operators to enhance existing throughout this and through industry confer and it was apparent that these guidelines were not well known or commonly documented in company these

toward the single focus of improving the unstable approach rate as the best way to prevent even though empirical data indicate finding safe landing guidelines published by flight safety foundation to address an identified gap in the alar tool kit risk reduction is not well known by operators and not documented in operations strategies for corrective decision making we conclude that there are three categories that can be defined in achieving an effective policy from logi the policy should make sense operationally for most environmental conditions encountered for the people executing the policy and those managing the policy operations and should be acceptable to those externally effected by the application of the policy traffic the policy must be managed effectively by the management this is important not only because of the need to achieve objectives set out by senior management but also because those ut the policy need to see and understand that the policy is being managed management over of the policy is awareness of the policy guidance and the risks associated with not executing the policy must be high for both flight crews and the following is list of recommended making strategies to mitigate dm strategy ensure the policy makes sense update the stable approach definition and sah to maximize their relevance to flight crews and their separate the stable approach definition and criteria from criteria and points to improve awareness that these are two distinct aspects of and that decision making continues beyond the approach this does not imply that they cannot meet at points throughout the approach and it is intended for the sop and communication designers to separate the psychological attachment of these two dm strategy manage the policy operators set specific compliance rate targets for and establish initiatives to achieve authorities amend industry and regulatory audit pro to include standards and recommended practices that address dm strategy increase increase awareness of noncompliance and risks associated with continuing to land when and awareness of the significant impact that pli has on operator flight industry and pilot enhance situational awareness to heighten flight awareness throughout the ap and and landing policy and procedural communication minimize the subjectivity of decision making for the decision maker pf or as per com to mitigate those components of situational awareness that compromise the risk assessment and for by installing stable approach monitoring decision making the following are recommendations for corrective action to mitigate noncompliance and execution each recommendation supports previously identified dm recommendation manufacturers should continue develop of and operators should install stable approach and energy management monitoring and alerting dm recommendation operators should understand their own respective compliance dm recommendation operators should establish internal around compliance rate targets and dm recommendation where flight crew ia and operator management should establish or process in which fda can be used to assist in effectively managing compliance dm recommendation operators and the industry should the stable approach criteria and sah to better align policies with manageable and operational safe see appendix for flight safety new stabilized approach and for industry avoid stable approach criteria and heights that address very that avoid criteria if are not likely to result in or if decision is may transfer risk to maneuver distinguish between profile criteria and energy management criteria and decision point which could have distinct and separate allow for variable objective not all environ create the same risk high tail winds and contaminated runways statistically create the the stable approach although mostly should allow an element of guided decision making that is corroborated between dm recommendation operators should establish and publish safe landing guidelines in operations keys to safe and see appendix revised safe landing for industry dm recommendation operators should develop procedures to be performed during every approach that describes the state of stability and the intention of the decision based on company effective elements of these communications the state of stability is made by the member not responsible for the decision to go around the pm or the first per company this creates shared responsibility for activity in the communication procedures are not passive or conditional call is made at the assigned point during every this forces communication procedures should be objective they should state facts about the this minimizes authority gradients within the communication procedures should be sequential and esca late if the condition is not corrected to within ac calls continue and escalate to defined point at which new directive call is for if an call at ft agl does not result in successful corrective the calls continue every ft until the condition is corrected or critical point is and then directive call is made this maintains continuous situational awareness updating of the similar to warning system active communication should continue well into the ap proach and landing up to the touchdown limit this maintains continuous situational each call should be answered with an ac or call by the decision maker pf or per company the call should not suggest the exclusion of other possible outcomes calling at mini when is an option can have the effect of the window of calling for on the other responding with or assists in keeping decision making dm recommendation operators should apply objective procedures well into the approach and landing including in the touchdown energy management monitoring and alerting systems will minimize the need for dm recommendation operators should create standard descent briefing guidelines that environmental risk instability factors that will result in review of standard decision making in the landing recommendation operators should create standard approach briefing guidelines that update the brief at period just before the approach is dm recommendation operators should understand their spec and flight situational awareness levels and psychological profiles for managing internal dm recommendation operators should provide training to enhance psychosocial awareness and and how they contribute to noncompliant decision dm recommendation operators should ensure no fault around policies are implemented and understood by management and flight dm recommendation operators should ensure that un approach and policies are concise and am including procedures and expectations for recommendation operators should communicate indus rates and internal compliance targets and goals of performance to flight crews and the ag involved in achieving operators also should mmu the potential that improved performance could have on the overall risk dm recommendation state and industry audit such as the iata operational safety audit should establish compliance standards and recommended practices for operators to manage dm recommendation state and industry safety organizations such as those associated with the international civil aviation organization the european aviation safety the faa commercial aviation safety team should review these recommendations and assess inserting them into their safety dm recommendation the aviation community should annually through global aggregate flight compliance rates for both the approach phase and the landing phase of and communicate the findings to the this role is suited to safety organizations such as flight safety dm recommendation the aviation community should develop and implement an initiative that communicates the compliance and the potential that improved performance could have on the ala rate and the overall accident this is role suited to global associations and safety such as flight safety dm recommendation the aviation community should estab new program to provide method for operators to share effective strategies to improve around compliance the information should be incorporated into an existing dm recommendation the industry should establish an fi for the effect of the phenomenon of noncompliance with as labels such as con flight into terrain or loss of control make it easier for the industry to understand and manage label for this phenomenon will do the and in so will help provide foundation for essential effective utility of each recommendation is and each recommendation addresses different finding or as can be seen in appendix holistic approach to implementing these recommendations will have the best overall and as with any significant program and effects should be closely monitored by an appropriate audit program such as line operations safety or execution the accident and incident review included random selection of

under that one of the many reasons that violating approach minimums is unacceptable is because evidence indicates that if then becomes the chances of safe transition to the are ex recommendation pilots must be able to demonstrate that they are able to safely execute that begin from both high energy and low energy states at the point where around decision is ex recommendation pilots must be able to exercise tactical as well as procedural when deciding to go around below stabilized approach gate so that safe execution is not hindered by an inappropriate delay in decision validation of this must be achieved through realistic training ex recommendation training for pilots should include range of operational including from positions other than and the designated sta approach scenarios should involve realistic simulation of typical landing weights and ex recommendation training for both pilots and controllers should incorporate lessons learned from operational ex recommendation clear guidance should be provided to pilots on how to act in respect to the three stages of monitoring during landing and alerting and taking members of augmented crews who are observing should have clear understanding of the nature of their to effective ex recommendation if an aircraft has the capability to fly automatic pilot training should be provided and the automation policy should address the ex recommendation pilots must have clear understanding of how the pitch control system works on the aircraft type that they this should be validated by both theoretical testing and use of suitable full flight simulator exercises involving approach and with rather than available and at typical landing ex recommendation review should be conducted to deter whether pilots can lose situational awareness of en conflicting traffic during if other pilots are exchanging radio transmissions with atc in languages other than ex recommendation high priority should be accorded to the provision of approach and missed approach ce dures when current procedures involve and when active radar surveillance of the transition to is not consideration should be given to withdrawing procedures at airports where neither option is ex recommendation air navigation service providers should review if enhance the provision of around risk awareness training for ex recommendation ensure that the importance of at stabilized approach and the correct application of final approach procedures is included in training and in briefings for atc staff recommendation implementation training should appropriate speed control timely descent the importance of avoiding late change of runway or change in the type of the importance of assigning landing runway with no significant tail wind the need to avoid vectoring too tightly onto final ap and intercepting glide path from the importance of providing the crew with correct information about distance to ex recommendation the agency responsible for instrument approach procedure design should ensure that straightforward procedures are available and published for each these procedures should be designed in consultation with pilots who are representative of those who will be expected to use the which underlie the map for each run as much as be the low below first stop altitude and an early turn in missed approach procedure should be conditional approach procedures xxx but not later than should be the missed approach fix should be located close to the airport to ensure that an aircraft in trouble can be landed immediately on any runway with any chosen by the procedural of the missed approach path from other traffic and from the risk of exposure to wake especially from late should be if both and conventional missed approach ce are then an explicit risk assessment of such availability should be environmental restrictions especially abatement restrictions must not affect the design of missed approach procedures if their imposition would compromise safety ex recommendation on final pilots should be advised of any significant changes in weather runway surface contingency should exist for use in wind shear implementation pilots should receive more relevant and quicker up of information about develop such as changes in wind and runway status quantity of water on the improved information should be provided to crews about tail wind

explore operational issues and reach an implementation pilots can be invited to attend training and controllers may be able to arrange to observe training days can be provided for pilots to observe operations at atc and it may be possible to organize familiarization flights for pilots and controllers should participate in joint crew resource management in establishing such be aware that it is most unlikely that the pilots participating in such an initiative will be representative of those using the atc services involved and any such bias must be explicitly ex recommendation aircraft manufacturers should ensure that procedures presented in aircraft pilot training and aircraft operating manuals are applicable to that are begun at any stage on final up to and including land that are rejected after ex recommendation safety regulators should review current mandatory training requirements for both pilots and controllers and should ensure that the conclusions of this report are appropriately flight safety foundation future work establish noncompliance industry label such as or fga to go this is to establish easy as has been accomplished with other such as loc or analyze and at global aggregate unstable approaches and unstable landings to determine the level of associated report global compliance performance develop execution and training guidelines for establish industry noncompliance audit standards and recommended practices with organizations such as the international civil aviation organization and in order to minimize the exposure to unnecessary while ensuring further analysis is required to deter the risk balance point between an unstable approach and the foundation should ensure industry partners pursue this promote the distribution and presentation of this report in and encourage republication in complementing publications and safety project conclusion the problem of policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the largest threat to flight safety the potential impact of improvement in compliance is fi no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go the first and foremost change required is that the industry must improve its awareness of the to achieve shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is the cultural shift will be much easier if the industry shifts as opposed to individual companies making changes on their having said several companies are already attacking this issue the project accomplished the goals set forth in the document announcing the fsf safety understand the noncompliance by flight and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight and to consider the safety risk associated with and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of this not all envisioned products are and this is noted in the report as future work to be done by flight safety

such overshoots are frequent or sustained overshoots are unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions requiring deviation from the above elements require special approach gate objective of active

occur if meeting the objective of the next gate is go if the is not by it could continue if being fully stable by ft is if the call at the respective gate indicates an undesired state or that call should be repeated at an appropriate interval until the condition is repeated every stabilized approach and decision guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind flight safety guidelines for conducting stabilized approaches and achieving reliable decision why the the current fsf guidelines were established in november and updated in analysis revealed that facets of that guidance are not optimal for effective deci making and that they may encourage for approaches involving very low the overall goal is to improve decision in revising the stabilized approach four objectives must be the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and management resulting in greater acceptance of the safety must be ensured during the approach by mitigating against the common types of alas energy hard tail runway excursions it must be ensured that the resulting are con ducted for approaches of appropriate and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to ma increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on the flight collective situational awareness must be improved through better flight crews indicated in the project research that current guidelines on when must be executed are not realistic for most operational environments and they described what realistic parameters look like from their the criteria for which stable approach is defined can be grouped into three types of flight path profile and configuration gear and speed and energy management of speed and add to these the variable environmental conditions length and and and there are four groups of parameters to be considered when designing stable approach approach gates we can address all stable approach parameters and ala safety issues at three procedural agl configuration gate from ft to depending on aircraft agl stable agl the stable approach criteria are the same at each gate for ap conducted in both imc and ft agl configuration gate previous guidance required that must be con if the flight was not fully stable in with respect to the physics of safety is the same in both imc and in this differentiation of at feet in imc and at feet in vmc is not the new functional significance of the mark is that it is the last suitable point along the approach to ensure that final landing configuration is selected and verified by the flight the flap and gear deceleration to final approach speed and thrust stabilization should occur before the aircraft reaches the next gate at ft it should be emphasized that initial configuration should occur before reaching the this gate is the last point at which final landing configuration should be selected and the gate is familiar demarcation to flight crews and is often accompanied by an automatically generated note that the gate may vary for air type and gross the operator should determine the appropriate height of the based on aircraft ra characteristics and the the following discussion of aircraft energy management during approach is based on the fsf alar briefing notes safety aircraft deceleration characteristics although deceleration characteristics largely depend on the aircraft type and gross the following typical values can be considered for quick assessment and management of aircraft deceleration deceleration on glide with landing flaps and gear to kt per glide path is typically equivalent to descent gradient of or vertical for final approach groundspeed of aircraft with final approach speed of kt would need to be at maximum speed of kt at the gate to be stable at using the median deceleration rate of kt per nm and descent rate of nm gate does not address any particular ala type but serves to facilitate achieving fully stabilized approach at the next lower gate it is in line with pilot as seen in experimental data from the that aircraft configuration and aircraft energy management are two separate and distinct aspects of stabilized and the aircraft energy stabilization height can be lower than the aircraft configuration although may be considered at this not mandating at this point reduces the overall number of potential by allowing unstable approaches to continue at safe analysis is discussed in improved collective situational awareness at this gate is achieved through procedural active communication between flight agl gate previous guidance required that must be conduct if the flight was not fully stable in the revised guid retains the recommendation that the approach should be fully stable at this the mandate to go around has been although may be considered at this not mandating reduces the overall number of potential by allowing unstable approaches to con while at safe analysis is found in not mandating at this gate also aligns with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project indicating can still be executed even from lower altitudes when conditions are stable or have only minor deviations outside the stable approach as this makes operational sense to those who execute and manage the there is better likelihood of the gate is suitable point in the approach for flight crew to verify all stable approach it is familiar mar for flight crews and is also often accompanied by an au generated being stable at this point in the approach allows for subsequent developing instabilities to be compared against state of constant energy improved collective situational awareness at this gate is also achieved through procedural active communication between flight ft agl gate this gate is establishing this gate clearly marks the boundary between higher altitudes where stable approach is strongly recommended and the point where continuing an unstable descent reduces the margin of it differentiates between approach stability and these are two distinct flight and from sy they should remain distinct elements in decision it should be understood that the agl value is not intended to be it can be approximated to take ad of aircraft automatic callout for consider an ils minimum set for ft some ac automatic callout systems provide an alert ft above so in such ft agl could be established as the gate value and utilized in the auto callout in the active call descending in an unstable state below the gate should be warning to flight crews that the level of risk is increasing and action is whether the aircraft is unstable at this gate or becomes unstable below analyses indicate that flight crews who continue an unstable descent below ft do not recognize the need for increased concern or the need for the awareness of the increased need for action can be improved by heightening the definition of the from being in an unstable condition to being in condition to go this can prompt the flight crew to make the correct decision to go martin smith of the group psychological tipping point is the moment of maximum situational is when the flight crew is primed to pull the trigger on the the subtle change to to go is such in other the to go is permission to mis to drawing comparison to another industry the pilot not flying is now known as the pm change that was intended to influence the mindset of the pm and also to alter his behavior in recognition of the importance of similar effect can be realized in identifying an unstable flight condition below ft as condition condition that demands to further emphasize the the to win can be viewed as the stable approach zone with the focus on ensuring that the aircraft is fully the area from ft to can be viewed as the primary where the focus shifts from liz the aircraft to going using rejected takeoff below maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action to stop the airplane within the stop as an rejected takeoff below kt is considered to occur in different regime compared with rejected takeoff above through training and there is shift in psychology for pilots operating in the similar shift can be realized through the approach to lowering the execution altitude reduces the overall number of potential by allowing approaches to continue while at alti it makes the stable approach and policies more in line with flight psychological beliefs and more manageable by prevents risk transfer from risk unstable approaches to potentially and limits unnecessary demands on the air traffic if not fully stable at or below this the decision to go around should be made without below ft is not necessarily this determination depends on the degree and type of approach and aircraft type and performance this gate is essentially the beginning of the primary zone from ft to thrust reverser at this the ala is the most common types of low energy alas are landing hard landing and tail if we analyze the most extreme case of low it is one where thrust is at flight speed is ref and the descent rate is fpm double normal rate of federal aviation regulations part the landing the steady gradient climb may not be less than with the engines at the power or thrust that is available eight seconds after initialization of move of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight idle to power design and construction of the engine must enable an increase from the fixed minimum flight idle power from not more than percent of rated takeoff power or thrust available to percent in not less than five the most limiting of these two regulations is the in our extreme case of descending at using linear anal without taking into consideration lessening of the rate of descent as engines and achieving climb the flight will descend ft figure per ft another useful analysis comes from flight safety alar tool kit which says that an aircraft being flown on while on approach with thrust at flight descending at fpm and with ref at minus will experience an altitude loss of approximately ft safety if we more than double the rate of descent to in this the aircraft would ex an altitude loss of approximately feet alar tool figure it is also interesting to look at design specifications for taws such as the technical standard order for such systems requires for the final approach segment warning be given in time to allow for obstacle clear altitude after recovery that includes pilot response time and standard gravitational era of the tso further describes the altitude loss of an aircraft de at with response time of one second and as being and says the required warning should be given no later than ft above the obstacle figure in comparison with these gate of ft agl to execute provides adequate altitude margin for even the most extreme unstable the margin in this case results in percent increase over the linear part percent increase over the fsf alar determination and percent increase over the taws although the number of approach and landing accidents is greater than the number of the around phase of flight has more fatalities per by ensuring safe altitude of ft to conduct in the extreme unstable and by allowing unstable approaches to continue between ft and the potential number of would be lower the exposure to comparisons of revised gates to industry monitoring and alerting and faa runway overrun prevention references the project identified significant benefits in reducing the subjectivity of the analysis by flight the most impactful way to minimize subjectivity is to employ automated systems similar in concept to ws figure altitude loss analysis unstable speed thrust vertical rate fpm loss from ft above ground fars part alar taws alar fsf approach and landing accident fars federal aviation taws terrain awareness and warning tso technical standard ref reference landing speed flight safety foundation tcas to help flight crews make timely and consistent the industry has developed few systems in the form of stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems for approach and landing energy the airbus runway overrun protection system has number of alerting and monitoring but those that are pertinent to this analysis are the visual alert that begins at ft agl and the aural alert at ft does evaluation of aircraft real energy and the runway distance available for and provides visual too alert at ft and an aural alert at ft because of the lower altitudes at which these alerts and considering the severity of the condition that not enough runway to stop the aircraft really is the only except in the most dire when comparing this condition to the conditions being applied to the proposed stabilized approach and the fsf guide are quite honeywell landing system also has many alerting and monitoring including aural alerts beginning at ft agl and ending at ft agl with an the criteria used by the system to make the alert are variable but based on monitoring excessive approach excessive speed and flap settings honeywell the altitudes where these alerts are given are similar to those recommended in the stabilized ap and achieving collective situational awareness through active communication this project found that situational awareness is lacking among most flight crews who continue an unstable descent and land communication is vital in achieving situational two key types of communication are recommended for improvements approach and landing brief and active communication sops throughout the approach and landing and briefings most airlines already have procedures for which ad the most important aspects of the approach and detailed guidance is provided in fsf alar briefing note safety foundation alar task the following guidance is not intended to replace those briefings but is an addition to current standard briefing improve overall ala awareness improve awareness of specific approach and landing as demonstrated in the project simply knowing few overall statistics can raise situational awareness fi when company statistics are they should be in their the following industry statistics can be alas make up approximately percent of all approximately percent of unstable approaches result in more than percent of runway excursions follow stable approach that becomes unstable after threshold reviewing the effects of runway contamination and tail winds on runway excursions is relevant because they contribute to significant number of runway the flight safety runway safety initiative found that about percent of runway landing excursions are of that percent follow stable of all percent were associated with and with runway the remaining per of runway landing excursions are and of that percent follow unstable approaches safety this project found that awareness of instabilities is important in the landing phase as well as in the approach some simple rules of thumb regarding the effect of poor landing technique on landing distance can significantly improve situational for pilots should plan for landing distances to in by ft per second of ft per kt excess speed from ref on dry ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet ft per ft excess above ft over runway this also applies when the vertical guidance for the ap by places the aircraft higher than ft agl when crossing the landing distances are based on threshold briefings including these statistics and rules of thumb should occur at intervals that will ensure that flight crews have an depth awareness of the for example briefings also should discuss any allowances for flight crews to adjust company policies discussion in safe landing as permitted by guided procedures in the policies themselves for allowing crew to conduct touchdown beyond the normal approach and and briefing briefing should in addition to existing approach briefing an emphasis on approach and landing when company statistics

adequate landing performance and distance references as briefings often occur minutes or more before an the project findings and suggest that short or refreshment of the current threats and be briefed just prior to the ap during period in the lower this can refresh and flight situational approach and and briefing active communication throughout the approach this project determined that communication is one of the key attributes of effective collaborative decision making by flight by factor of approximately flight crews who comply with their policy had uni about approach and for most crews who con an unstable approach and no one made the actual decision to that there was no communication about the decision to it just the difficulty with calls which are made only if prob condition exists is that in their it is undetermined if the condition the call could be absent for several as explained in the report active force flight crews to discuss or express condition either positive or negative on every it is also important not to overload the flight crew with standard communication and to ensure that they have time to listen to atc and perform other active calls must be short and calls are usually initiated by the pm and responded to by the the call on the approach normally indicates and the response by the pf may either be an ac or directional it is recommended that there be an active call at each ap if the active call indicates an undesired aircraft the call should continue to be made periodically throughout the approach at intervals such as each ft or until the desired state is achieved or is this serves the same purpose as warning from ws or repetitive calls in the to zone also pre the pf for an eventual conclusion if the offending ndi is not that repetitive warning calls prime the and relational as compared with common current procedures in which single go call is made at or which has lesser ef in primarily the hierarchical the implementation of active

examples of active calls at approach gates during an if an airline has stable approach and monitoring system such as or the need for complete series of active calls throughout the approach and landing

touchdown aim point touchdown aim point markings are white rectangular one on each side of the runway that begin at the distances indicated the width of the markings varies with the width of the flight safety foundation fsf safe landing guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind the revised flight safety foundation guidelines for safe landing and achieving reliable decision making during the landing as with the stable approach and decision there were several namely that the guidelines make operational sense for both flight crews and manage to improve agreement with the ensure safety during landing by mitigating the common types of landing runway excursions and ensure the resultant are in situations of ap and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to maneuver increases overall and unnecessarily increases demands on improve the flight collective situational the guidelines established here do not replace manufacturer limitations and procedural or state regulations and excursions that occur following an unstable approach are mitigated largely in the approach they can still prevented in the landing large numbers of excursions occur following stable approach that becomes unstable only after the aircraft passes the runway thresh guidelines in this section are targeted at these types of landing excursions are of two in which aircraft run off the end of the runway surface and in which aircraft exit the side of the runway to address these types of we will enhance landing guidelines in four longitudinal limit awareness touchdown zone and lateral limit awareness environmental variability and adjustments to established situational awareness and project findings include that collective situational awareness is low during the landing and although most opera have policies defining where the touchdown should very few have guidance or sops on how to determine where the touchdown or how and when to determine if around should be for most operators spec that the aircraft should touch down in the touchdown zone on the they do not train or specify how to determine if the aircraft has passed the who should make the or how much of deviation from the runway centerline is permissible before should be most pilots say either gut feeling or experience helps them judge when an aircraft has passed the acceptable even though they readily state that their experience does not include from the landing the impact of improving collective situational awareness in the landing phase can be longitudinal limit awareness dz and touchdown zones vary in length with one determining factor being total runway runways of ft and longer have touchdown zones ft long and runways of and longer have touchdown zones long relative positioning markings are present within the dz and are clearly identifiable on the aiming point is the widest marking located at the distance from the threshold and distance from the threshold with the end of the dz being identified by the last marking at ft and approach alerting and monitoring systems such as smart provide aural alerts when an aircraft has passed touchdown when an aircraft passes this area without touching an aural alert such as deep is given honeywell sops then dictate this objective warning immediately enhances crew awareness and leads to better decision in the absence of such the through can be directed to monitor the passing of dz markings and make an active call such as or of after passing the last marking indicating the passage of the in cases in which the runway is contaminated and markings are not couple of options if remaining markers can be using the landing distance of pilots can calculate for an aircraft traveling ft per the normal touchdown area of to ft will occur in four to eight seconds fps seconds to calculations also will show that the end of the dz will pass in approximately seconds fps lateral limit awareness most operators specify that the touchdown shall occur on the runway but do not say how this will hap or who will determine when the aircraft is as important as it is to have situational awareness regarding longitudinal it is equally important to understand lateral manufacturers often provide cockpit visual cues and techniques for determining where the main landing gear is in relation to the aircraft as an boeing says for the the view through lower outboard corner of the forward win to the ground is good visual reference for the outboard side of the main landing gear wheels on the same the lower inboard corner of the forward window is also good reference for the opposite side main gear boeing in the absence of other lateral maintaining the most outboard main landing gears on either side of the centerline is reasonable using visual as in the example can help determine the positioning of the main landing this is considered rough operational guide with its own there are no known alternatives other than relying on the monitor of this positioning can be performed by the pm during the and if he or she sees that the position of the aircraft is he can make an appropriate call in that sops would dictate environmental variability and adjustments to established policies environmental variability can have significant effect on land performance and desired touchdown operators should consider giving flight crews the tools and guidelines to determine when it makes sense to modify or adjust landing and policies for and possibly operational it can be difficult for some operators to consider allowing crew to land beyond the landing combined with sound guidance and policies for operating outside normal makes sense when safe operations are we also have the problem of rules with no room to apply kern said in of these policies begin with good but inside the good we create systems that defy logic and poison the well of which often results in an unintended consequence loss of faith in the system of problems can develop when environmental conditions are such that operating outside established policies makes but there are no guiding principles on how to accomplish for an aircraft landing on run requires landing although the company policy states that should be initiated if touchdown does not occur inside the is it the best course of action as opposed to an option of extending the touchdown point to ft for the answer is if the mark is not if the flight crew can identify this point and if they have briefed the revision to the is it still the best course of action to go in this the transfer of risk to is revised touchdown point can be determined by citing known distance point along the runway taxi runway distance marker or time period one second approximates ft in in another case in which weather and runway conditions demand that touchdown occur before the end of the guid should give crews the methods and means to identify the shorter touchdown for if the crew wants to be touching down within ft of the runway thresh they need references to determine where this will using dz markings or time lapse from the time the aircraft crosses the in any written policies and guidance must be in place to give the flight crew procedures and techniques to modify landing point this should be briefed and agreed upon by all figure approach and landing gates and active end of dz of of deep window window not window not dz touchdown zone calls can be substituted with auto such as flight safety foundation situational awareness and communication figure shows examples of new active calls recommended in the landing phase of in the case of exceeding centerline touchdown it is difficult to define point in the dz where positive centerline active call can be although not in this the use of call may be more that the call is made only when the drift limit is note that stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems accomplish the objectives of some active flight crew calls would not be fsf recommended elements of stabilized approach recommended elements of stabilized approach all flights must be stabilized by ft above airport

The Missed Approach \\u2013 Hey Where\\u2019s the Runway?1Missed Approach SegmentA Missed approach is a procedure used when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing The Missed Approach Segment is that part of an instrument approach procedure between the missed approach point (MAP), the missed approach way-point (MAWP), or the point of arrival at the decision height and the specified missed approach NAVAID (navigational aid), intersection, fix, or waypoint, as appropriate, at the minimum IFR altitude It is in this part of the approach procedure that the aircraft will climb and return to the en route structure or is positioned for holding or subsequent approach The missed approach route and altitudes are shown on the instrument approach charts2The Missed ApproachThe missed approach is one of the most difficult and critical phases of an instrument approach and is the one practiced the least High workload, as the configuration of the aircraft must be changed (approach to climb out), coupled with new navigation route/Navaids An approach in actual conditions should be flown with the anticipation that the missed approach is an anticipated outcome The missed approach procedure typically includes an initial heading or track to follow, and an altitude to climb to.  This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix Be sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach FAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed: 1.  Whenever: Flight visibility is less than the specified visibility for the approach If required visual references are not seen at either of the following times:  When the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or Upon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DA/DH where a DA/DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that until touchdown. 2.  Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References FAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA: The approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable The threshold The threshold markings The visual approach slope indicator The threshold lights The runway end identifier lights (REIL) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings The touchdown zone lights The runway or runway markings The runway lights Basic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting 6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible Full scale needle deflection past the final approach fix Navigation equipment required for the approach fails ATC instructs you to go missed Unsafe runway Traffic Controller or pilot navigation errors Weather \\u2013 e.g., thunderstorm cell When the aircraft is being operated below MDA \\u2013 loss of visual references If your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure A controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions Verbal Missed Approach Instructions ATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach ATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required ATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency]. Be advised [Traffic...]\\u201c If executing instructions different from those on the procedure as dictated by approach, call \\u201con the go\" or \"executing climb out\" to reduce confusion 9Missed Approach Chart SymbolsTo provide ready missed approach guidance, approach plates use quick reference icons Due to limited space only four or less icons can be shown. Hence the icons may not show the entire missed approach procedure The full missed approach instructions are provided textually at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing10JEPP Missed Approach Chart Symbols11NACO Missed Approach Chart Symbols12Climb to altitudeTurn to specified headingTo Specified fixTrack RadialMissed Approach Point LocationThe missed approach point (MAP) on a non-precision approach is\\u2009not designed with any consideration to where the\\u2009aircraft must begin descent to execute a safe landing It is developed based on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and possibly air traffic considerations Descent below the MDA, including during the missed approach, is not authorized The Decision Altitude (DA) is an altitude derived location where a missed approach will be initiated on a precision approach Obstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach Decision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). 13Obstacle Protection Obstacle protection is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the DA/H or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA) A climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart When higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix Preplan your approach to ensure you can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile)  Higher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute) Tables for climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are on page D1 of U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets Formula: Required Climb Per Minute = ((_[climb gradient]_ ft/nautical mile) x ([ground speed] nautical miles/hour)/60) = 36,000 feet per hour = 14Beginning the Procedure Other Than at the MAP/DHIn the design of the missed approach procedure no consideration is given to an abnormally early missed approach turn from the approach course When an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC,  Fly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point  Remain at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver Can begin climb early, absent altitude restrictions Think CFIT when making an early missed!!15Circling Approach MAPExecuting the missed approach after starting the circling maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP The missed approach is executed for the runway the approach started on, not the runway you were circling to The initial turn on a missed approach will always be towards the landing runway until established on a segment of the missed approach Always think about how to execute the missed approach while circling so it is not a surprise if you enter IMC as aircraft is clear of obstacles only when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area16Since the circling missed approach maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost.Flying the Missed ApproachBefore the FAF  Memorize initial altitudes and headings Set up No. 2 Nav if possible for missed approach initial navaid course17Flying the Missed Approach Initial Missed Approach Segment ProcedureAt the MAP / DA Add climb power Rotate gradually (on-speed) to Vx Check for positive rate of climb Clean up the aircraft \\u2013 gear and flaps up in the order specified by the POH Climb out at appropriate speed18CommunicateUpon execution of a missed approach and becoming stabilized in climb notify ATC If communicating with the Tower - \"[Place] tower, [Callsign], missed approach [Reason]\" If communicating with approach - \"[Place] approach, [Callsign] missed approach off of [Location] climbing through [Altitude] for [Altitude] with request\"19Lost Communications Missed ApproachIf communications are lost during the approach and you take a missed approach: Squawk 7600 Follow the published missed approach instructions to ensure adequate obstruction clearance Route: Proceed to the alternate IAF as filed and commence an approach Altitude: The EXPECTED altitude, if given one, after filing a \\u201cDRAFT\\u201d or;

The NOTAM will specify both the textual instructions and any additional equipment requirements necessary to complete the procedure You may reject an ATC clearance for an alternate missed approach that requires equipment not necessary for the published approach procedure when the alternate missed approach is issued after beginning the approach However, if the alternate missed approach is issued prior to beginning the approach the pilot must either accept the entire procedure (including the alternate missed approach) or request a different approach procedure22G1000 Missed ApproachAt the MAP, \\u201cSUSP\\u201d is displayed in the HSI and directly above the SUSP softkey Automatic sequencing of approach waypoints is suspended at the MAP A \\u201cFROM\\u201d indication is displayed on the CDI, but the course guidance is simply an extension of the final approach course  Do NOT follow this extended course When the message \\u201cRAIM is not available\\u201d is displayed in the Alerts Window on the PFD a missed approach must also be executed23G1000 Missed ApproachFlying the Missed Initiate the missed approach sequence by following the missed approach procedures as published / directed by ATC, for proper climb and heading instructions If not already using GPS as nav source, press the CDI softkey to switch external CDI output to GPS for guidance.

The brain incorrectly resolves the two forces as a single pitch-up movement When that occurs, the pilot feels as though the aircraft is climbing or that the nose is pitching up, when, in fact, it remains in level flight.   The normal reaction, absent visual clues, to the pitch-up illusion is to push forward on the stick with the risk of ground contact in a missed approach28Common ErrorsFailure to have essential knowledge of the information on the approach chart Failure to have initial steps of missed approach committed to memory Failure to identify DH or MAP or other condition requiring a missed approach Incorrect communication procedures  Noncompliance with ATC clearances, the published missed approach or an ATC instruction or failure to notify ATC of inability to comply Failure to accomplish checklist items Faulty basic instrument flying techniques Failure to accomplished a missed approach timely \\u2013 e.g. motoring on to look for references29PTS Standards Area of Operation VI.

      "   FLIGHT ENVELOPE  (Example document for LSA applicants – v1 of 08.03.16)          Introduction This document defines the flight envelope of the ABCD aircraft. The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The boundaries of the flight envelope will be defined within this document. All speeds are calibrated airspeeds (CAS) (requirement 4.4 ) and given in knots if not stated otherwise. All other units used are metric (SI units). The weights are given in mass units (kg) but the formulas require force units as input, therefore these are calculated in place wherever they are used. Note: The speeds defined within this document should be used for the placards, speed markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by flight test.

Maximum speed in level flight VH According to flight tests  at maximum weight and maximum continuous power at sea level conditions, the maximum speed in level flight has been determined:  Stall speeds VS, VS0, VS1 These speeds will be verified by flight test according to requirement 4.4.1 .  In order to calculate the stall speed, the maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane as a whole is determined first. The maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane has been calculated starting from the polar curve of the wing profile taken form ref.  (p. 236, Re=2.9E6 flaps retracted  and p.237,  for the flaps in landing configuration, and  in take-off configuration). Considering the horizontal tail balancing force and the lower total wing lift due to wing lift distribution, the total aeroplane lift coefficient has been lowered by 15% with respect to the one of the profile.   Therefore aeroplane lift coefficient is estimated to   and for the landing configuration (since the span extension of the flaps is half of the span of the wing):  Stall speeds have been calculated based on these calculated lift coefficients. The wetted wing area SW is used instead of total wing area S because of a lower lift within the fuselage section of the span. Flaps retracted (take-off configuration):  Flaps extended (landing configuration):  Flaps extended (take-off configuration):  With . The stall speed in landing configuration (flaps fully extended to 40 degrees) is 44 kts. Therefore it is In accordance with CS-LSA.5 . In Take-Off configuration (flaps extended to 20 degrees) the stall speed is 47 kts. (Note: These speeds are estimates. The methods for the estimation can be various. It is important that these estimations are as precise as possible. Flight tests will be used to validate the stall speeds. In case the flight tests show different values, this might have an impact on the speeds used for design and ultimately might impair the compliance to the CS-LSA.5.)  Design manoeuvring speed VA According to requirement 5.2.4.1     Flaps maximum operating speed VF According to requirement 5.2.4.2 , such speed shall be not less than the greater of      and   The speed has been selected as:            This is the maximum flap operating speed for the take-off (at 20 degrees) and landing flap settings at 40 degrees. Flaps maximum extension speed VFE On this aeroplane the maximum flap extension speed is identical to the flap operating speed VF.  This speed is the maximum speed for flaps in take-off and landing configuration. Design cruising speed VC According to requirement 5.2.4.3    may not be less than:  and need not be greater than:  The speed has been selected as:  (Note:  can be selected to be higher than  .) (Note:  and VDF ,VD ,VNE correlate with each other. should be selected to allow for a minimum margin of 22% to VDF in order to be able to satisfy the requirements for the next subchapters.) Design dive speed VD According to requirement 5.2.4.4   For  a higher value than the one above has been chosen:  (Note: ASTM F2245-12d 5.2.4.4  requires an exact value for the dive speed. Indeed, such value should be understood as a minimum value. This will be clarified in the next amendment of the CS-LSA.)  Demonstrated dive speed VDF According to requirement 4.1.1.1  VDF must be less than or equal to VD. In this case VDF is equal to VD:  (Note: In case the demonstrated VDF is lower than VD then VNE needs to be limited accordingly which could have an impact on the selection of VC as well.) Never exceed speed VNE According to requirement 4.1.1.2  the VNE Shall be greater than or equal to:  and  must be less than or equal to:  The speed has been selected as:  Note: If the aircraft is equipped with retractable landing gear then VLO must be determined as well (CS-LSA.15 6.12.2). Altitude The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. In fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)  Manoeuvring and Gust load factors n Summary of limit load factors according to certification specifications and gust requirements. Table 2 – Manoeuvring limit load factors  Gust envelope Gust load factors need to be considered because they can exceed the prescribed maximum load factors at different weights and altitudes. Since gust loads depend on air density and aircraft mass they will be calculated for all twelve cases (sea level and 10000ft=FL100, maximum, minimum flying weight and minimum flying weight with full wing fuel tanks) according to requirement 5.2.3.3  with flaps retracted (requirement 5.2.6.1 ) and fully extended (requirement 5.2.6.2 ) at . The calculation is based on appendix X3 . To calculate the gust loads at altitudes other than at sea level the formula X3.1  is altered to include the density at sea level  as well:  The corresponding weights are defined within . Since the gust loads on the wing and tail have been chosen to be treated together,  is the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane (). (Note: the applicant should provide the method for the calculation of the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane)  Table 3 – Gust load factors V-n Envelope Below a typical flight envelope is shown. This specific one is corresponding to MTOW and FL100. For other design weights the shape of the envelope remains similar, with the difference that the gust lines will change (due to different load factors as per Table 3).

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. Within this document the loads on the wings are determined throughout the whole flight envelope  and for the design weights as determined in  under all loading conditions. The simplified criteria of requirement X.1  have not been used for these calculations. The Loads are calculated using literature methods taken from the documents referenced in chapter 1. The following assumptions are made: Applicable to LSA only; no compressibility effects; conventional configuration (e.g. no tandem aircraft, bi-plane or canard); no pitching moment of the horizontal tail (symmetrical profile); no winglets, no wing tip tanks; no sweep, straight leading edge, no twist, constant profile, no dihedral; effect of the wing deformation on the loads not considered; no spoilers or airbrakes; landing gear attached to fuselage;  no wing struts (cantilever wing);     References List of Abbreviations CG centre of gravity LE leading edge ISA international standard atmosphere by International Organisation for Standardisation  KEAS knots equivalent airspeed MAC mean aerodynamic chord MTOW maximum take-off weight SI international system of units  angle of attack of the wing [deg]  local angle of attack of the station i [deg]  wing zero lift angle of attack [deg]  profile zero lift angle of attack [deg] a lift curve slope [1/deg] AR wing aspect ratio calculated by  [] b wing span [m]  average wing span at station i (mid span position of station) [m]  wing span position of MAC [m]  average fuselage width at wing section [m]  maximum fuselage width (equals ) [m]  local angle between resulting force and normal force at station [deg]  average chord at station i [m]  mean aerodynamic chord [m]  chord at wing root  [m]  chord at wing tip [m]  shear axis relative position as a fraction of local wing chord []  drag coefficient  []  lift coefficient  []  fuselage pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift profile pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient [] D drag force on the wings [N] d span wise drag line loading []  wing sweep of the quarter chord line [deg]  g gravity acceleration [m/s2]  fuselage moment factor []  total wing lift force (on both wings) [N]  local lift at station i [N]  lift line loading on the wing [N/m]  total horizontal tail lift force [N]  total fuselage length [m]  fuselage length in front of wing quarter mean aerodynamic chord point [m]  taper ratio (equals  ) []  wing pitching moment with lift acting on its aerodynamic centre [N]  moments around y axis [Nm]  normal force [N] n load factor [] num total number of stations of a single wing; num = 10 []   density of ambient air at a specific altitude []  running horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  incremental horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  running vertical shear force at station I (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  incremental vertical shear force at station i (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  local resulting force at station i [N] S wing area (not including wing carry-through) []  local tangential force at station i [N]  total torsion around elastic axis of the wing (at wing root) [mN]  local torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  incremental torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  dynamic viscosity (for Reynolds number) [] v airspeed [m/s] W total aircraft weight [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload)  [kg/m2]  total weight of a single wing (with no fuel or payload) [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload) [kg/m2] x longitudinal axis of the aircraft [m] distance to HT quarter chord line from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to aircraft centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to fuel centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE at station i [m]   aerodynamic centre shift due to fuselage pitching moment [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing-fuselage combination with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing fuselage combination from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord)  [m]    shear axis of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m] y lateral axis of the aircraft (span wise direction) [m]  average wing span position at station i [m]  spanwise width of station i [m] z vertical axis of the aircraft [m]  Throughout this document SI-units are used with speeds expected as m/s and angles in degrees if not stated otherwise. Requirements This document covers the following certification specifications requirements: Table 1 – Requirements   Input data The values shown below are derived from design data or other compliance documents for this particular aeroplane.   Load Calculation  The following steps have been followed: Load cases: First, the load cases have been identified in, in terms of weight, centre of gravity, speed, load factor, flap/aileron position, Altitude.  External Loads on the wing: for all load cases, the loads on the wing are calculated; Internal Loads in the wing: for the same load cases the internal loads in the wing (shear, bending moment, torsion) are calculated considering also the effect of the inertia of the wing;  Load cases Table 3 comprises all load cases corresponding to the points of the flight envelope  and design weights and centres of gravity .  Important:  Loads corresponding to flap deflected are considered not critical for the wing and will not be calculated in this document (flap loads will be calculated instead for the flap verification). Loads corresponding to landing conditions are considered not critical for the wing (since the landing gear is attached to the fuselage and no tip tanks or other large masses under the wing) and will not be calculated in this document. For the gust load calculations the wing and horizontal tail are treated together according to X3.1 in ref. . The resulting gust load accelerations are therefore calculated using the slope of the lift curve of the aeroplane (see also ) and treated as balanced flight conditions within this document.  Note: These assumptions have been considered realistic for this aeroplane but they are not of generic validity. It is the responsibility of the applicant to define the set of assumptions which can be acceptable for the particular aeroplane.   Altitude: The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. in fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)    Figure 1 – Reference flight envelope (WMTOW, FL 100) Table 2 – Design weights (explained in ref. ) Table 3 – Load cases Note: For this revision of this example document, asymmetric load cases have not been calculated. Loads on the aeroplane Reference axes and sign convention  Figure 2 – Aeroplane reference axes The origin is located at the airplane axis of symmetry (x axis) with the y axis passing through the leading edge of the mean aerodynamic chord section of the wing. Symmetrical flight conditions The loads on the wing structure arising from symmetrical flight manoeuvres according to requirements 5.2.2 and 5.2.3  are determined within this chapter.  The following abbreviations are used within this chapter (all measurements with respect to wing leading edge at wing mean aerodynamic chord, forces acting according to arrows are positive) x longitudinal axis of the aircraft z vertical axis of the aircraft CG aircraft centre of gravity HT horizontal tail L lift force on the wings  horizontal tail balancing force (HT lift force)  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient (lift force assumed to act on  )  total pitching moment (must be zero for equilibrium) n W aircraft total weight force (= m*n*g )  distance to HT quarter chord line (of HT MAC as quarter chord line)  distance to aircraft centre of gravity  distance to wing fuselage combination centre of pressure   (lift force acting on not generating any pitching moment)  distance to wing fuselage combination aerodynamic centre   (lift force acting on generating constant pitching moment ) The external forces and moments acting on the aeroplane in a balanced flight condition have been determined. The simplified scheme in Figure 3 is considered. The aeroplane is reduced to the wing and the Horizontal tail.  Figure 3 – Aeroplane simplified scheme The following forces are considered and placed in equilibrium:  Lift on the wing; Horizontal tail balancing load according to requirement 5.2.2.1 ; Weight of the aeroplane; For the calculation of the equilibrium, the z-axis of the aeroplane is assumed aligned with the direction of the gravity. In a second stage (section 6.4), once the forces are calculated, the corresponding angle of attack will be considered for the calculation of the correct direction of the forces on the wing;  Influence of thrust and drag (of the total airplane) are considered negligible at this stage of calculation of the vertical forces. The effect of the drag will be considered in a second stage on the wing only; The wing lift is assumed to act on the aerodynamic centre of the wing as a starting point. The contribution of the fuselage is accounted for as a shift of the point of aerodynamic centre. This is better explained in section 6.1.5. The HT lift is applied at 25% of the chord; Effects of structural flexure are considered negligible; Angular accelerations are disregarded until the aeroplane has attained the prescribed load factor (according to requirement 5.2.2.3 ); Note: The assumptions above provide a clear simplification to the calculations. The fact that they are used here does not mean that they can always be used. It is the responsibility of the designer to make the appropriate assumptions and to agree them with the Agency. Based on the above assumptions the following equilibrium equations are set. The basis system of equations include 4 equations with the following unknowns: L: wing Lift (including fuselage) CL: wing lift coefficient LHT: HT lift XAC f+w: aerodynamic centre w+f (wing + fuselage; see sec. 6.1.3 and 6.1.5) Equilibrium of moments  (f. 6.1.2.1) Equilibrium of forces   (f. 6.1.2.2) wing pitching moment   (f.6.1.2.3) (for wing) wing lift coefficient  (f. 6.1.2.4) Aerodynamic centre The aerodynamic centre is a characteristic of the wing and it is defined as the point about which the pitch moment does not change with changes of the angle of attack throughout the linear range of the lift curve.  According to  the aerodynamic centre can be estimated by adding a correction factor (shift) to the quarter chord point of the mean aerodynamic chord. The correction factor is a function of the maximum thickness of the profile which in this wing is 16% of the chord. For a tapered wing, the mean aerodynamic chord corresponds to the mean chord and it is  (see ). For this wing the correction factor is 0.012 (from Fig.2  at 16% thickness), so the mean aerodynamic centre of the wing without fuselage is    (f. 6.1.3.1) Pitching moment of the wing The pitching moment of the profile from two dimensional wind tunnel test data  does not represent the moment of a three dimensional with the profile. The pitching moment of the whole wing is calculated according to DATCOM method 1 (formula 4.1.4.1.a ).  (formula 4.1.4.1.a ) (f. 6.1.4.1) With quarter chord sweep angle of the wing .   Influence of the fuselage The fuselage is assumed to provide negligible lift. On the other hand, its influence on the aeroplane equilibrium is accounted for as a contribution to the pitching moment. In particular the following formula (taken from ref ) provides the shift of the aerodynamic centre of the wing due to fuselage pitching moment.  (f. 6.1.5.1) With  and  as input to the diagram in  yielding  and a correction factor of 1.05 due to low-wing configuration. The shift of aerodynamic centre, due to the fuselage, is calculated as:   (f. 6.1.5.2) Forces and moments acting on the wings In previous chapter the Lift and the lift coefficient have been determined. Having those as inputs, the drag and angle of attack are calculated. Total wing drag coefficient  (FIG. X2.1 of)(f. 6.2.1) Drag force on the wings  (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.2) The angle of attack (using as reference instead of ) for each load case is calculated using the following formula:   (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.3) Where: lift curve slope    (FIG. X2.1 of ) (f. 6.2.4) and the zero-lift angle of the wing is taken as . This value is the zero-lift angle of the corresponding wing profile, taken from ref  (p.236).   The results of this chapter for the load cases highlighted in subchapter 0 are presented within the table below. Table 4 – Loads on the aeroplane Unsymmetrical flight conditions Note: These load cases will not be calculated within this revision of the example document.   Wing load distribution After having calculated the total load on the wing, the load distribution is calculated and shown in the following sections. Every load is assumed to act on the span wise centre of each station.  Figure 4 – Location of wing stations Wing lift distribution The wing lift distribution is calculated here. The lift contribution of the fuselage is assumed to be zero (this means that the load which would act in correspondence of the fuselage, is shifted externally to the wing) leading to more conservative results on the wing loads since they provide higher bending. Note: Alternatively, the applicant would have to determine the reduction in wing lift distribution at the location of the fuselage and demonstrate the validity of the approach.  Figure 5 – Effect of the fuselage, areas A (total lift calculated at the end of this chapter)  and B (total lift according to Schrenk) are of equal size   This approach is based on the approximation described by Schrenk  and requires adjustments: moving the apex of the elliptical distribution from the fuselage centre towards the wing root increasing lift of wetted wing sections to compensate for zero lift of fuselage wing section The formula for wing lift distribution is derived from Schrenk  and is altered to assume zero lift at the wing section within the fuselage as shown below. The formula gives the value of the lift for span unit. “i” identifies the individual station.   Figure 6 –  lift distribution with zero lift at fuselage wing section   ()  (f. 6.4.1.1) Now the lift of the wing section within the fuselage is redistributed across the wetted wing area to achieve conservative results. The lift distribution calculated above is adjusted by multiplication of a correction factor derived from comparison between total lift of the whole wing including the fuselage section and the wetted wing only.  Figure 7 – Fuselage wing section lift redistributed across wetted wing stations        or  (f. 6.4.1.2) The lift distribution corresponding to the formula above, gives a value of lift at wing tip which is higher than zero and therefore does not fully reproduce the actual loading (the winglift is normally zero at the tip). Nevertheless this assumption does not give significant changes and yields conservative results. The local angle of attack for the station I, as a result of this corrected Schrenk distribution, is given by the following formula:  (from f.6.2.3 and f.6.1.2.4) (f. 6.4.1.3) Note: FAA AC 23-19A, paragraph 23.301, contains other acceptable methods.   Figure 9 – Span wise lift distribution  Wing drag distribution Since the effect of the drag is negligible, when compared to the effect of the lift, the span wise drag distribution has been assumed constant throughout wing span. This is a conservative assumption. The drag loading per metre of span:   (f. 6.4.2.1) Wing and fuel mass distribution The local masses are calculated for each wing station to account for the mass of the structure of the wing including the systems and control surfaces (control systems, and other equipment). It is assumed that the wing has a linear distribution proportional to the chord. At each station the point of application of the mass is 45% of the chord.  Figure 10 – Wing mass distribution  Figure 11 – Fuel distribution A constant fuel distribution (at a point of application of 20% of the chord) is assumed throughout the fuel tank span.  Table 5 – Mass distribution with full fuel Wing torsion distribution At each station, the wing lift is assumed to be acting at the local centre of pressure, which is calculated using the formula:  (from eq. 9.17.(d) )  (f. 6.4.4.1) Where, ci is the chord at each station, cm0_w_i is the pitching moment around the aerodynamic centre of the wing section (it is -0.0436 across the wing from chapter 6.1.4), CL_i is the local lift coefficient and comes from the corrected Schrenk distribution () in 6.1.5. Therefore centre of pressure location is dependent on the local angle of attack. Each station’s lift force acts on its centre of pressure and imposes torsion around the wing elastic axis which for this aeroplane is located approximately at a constant chord percentage of 30% (see design data - the main spar is approximately at 25% of the chord) throughout the entire wing span with local positions  as local shear centres at the stations. Note: the location of the elastic axis for this wing has been assumed at 30%. It is responsibility of the applicant to determine and justify the location of the elastic axis.  Incremental torsion load on structure at each station with respect to local wing shear centre including contribution of fuel and wing structure inertia forces:   (f..2) Torsion at each station i (with respect to shear centre) is:    (f. 6.4.4.3) Distribution of internal loads The components of the internal loads on the wing structure are calculated in different steps for each station. The flight load factor n is assumed to act in parallel to the direction of the lift force instead of the direction of the normal force (As required by 5.2.1.1 of ref. ). The difference is assumed negligible. The incremental shear load parallel to lift force vector at station i is taking into account also the inertia unloading of the wing   (f. 6.4.5.1) Incremental shear load parallel to drag force vector at station i:   (f. 6.4.5.2) With  representing the width of the station i. The summation of incremental shear loads throughout the stations to obtain the absolute shear loads at station i is presented below. Shear load parallel to lift force vector   (f..3) Shear load parallel to drag force vector   (f. 6.4.5.4) The components of the loads along the normal and tangential directions are derived by using the following formulas and figure:  Figure 12 – Forces components on the wing (The tangential force is oriented opposite to the x axis and is therefore positive when directed towards the front of the aeroplane.) Resulting force angle   (f.6.4.5.5)  Shear loads along the directions of:  resulting force  (f. 6.4.5.6)  tangential force  (f. 6.4.5.7)  normal force  (f. 6.4.5.8) With the local angle of attack for the station i as a result of the corrected Schrenk distribution given by the following formula:  (from f. 6.4.1.4) Summation of shear loads to obtain the bending moments at each station and using the increased lever arm ( instead of  ) at the wing tip station results in slightly more conservative values. Bending moment along normal direction   (f. 6.4.5.9) Bending moment along tangential direction    (f. 6.4.5.10) The results are presented within the graphs and tables below.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The permissible centre of gravity range is dictated by the aerodynamic design requirements for the airplane. Then the centre of gravity locations corresponding to the critical weights are calculated. All units used are metric (SI units) except for airspeeds (CAS) given in knots if not stated otherwise. Note: The values defined within this document should be used for the placards, markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by testing.

The data contained herein is used to establish aeroplane loading limits: Table 2 – Mass items (Note: In this document the weight of the empty aircraft is assumed to be determined through direct weighing. Such information might be needed during early phases of the design, when no prototype is available. In this case the weight of the empty aircraft should be determined through estimation. It is important in this case to have a breakdown of the main items in terms of weight and locations, so that the weight can be kept under control and avoid situations where the assumed envelope cannot be achieved.) Aircraft weights The following design weights have been identified since: either they are clearly required by the CS-LSA requirements, or they impose critical loads or flight characteristics. Basic empty weight WBEW The basic empty weight needs to be determined to identify its centre of gravity according to requirement 4.2.3  as empty CG. All load conditions determined within this document are based on the basic empty weight of the aircraft. It includes empty weight of the aircraft and the unusable amount of fuel. Basic empty weight has been determined to WBEW = 366 kg. Note: The basic empty weight must include all equipment for the operation intended including optional avionics packages – for example. Basic empty weight (366 kg) vs maximum empty weight WMEW (400kg) According to 4.2.1 of , the minimum useful load  should be 200kg consisting of 172Kg = both seats occupied with persons of 86kg each (4.2.1.1 ) 28kg = fuel for 1 hour flight at  as determined by  (4.2.1.2 ) According to 3.1.2  the maximum empty weight of the aeroplane shall be equal to: . The aeroplane complies with its Basic empty weight including unusable fuel: . Minimum flying weight Wmin (421kg) The minimum flying weight needs to be determined by requirement 4.2.2  and is a design load case leading to highest load factors during gust penetration. It assumes only a pilot of weight of 55 kg.  Minimum full fuel flying weight WminFF (495kg) The minimum flying weight with full fuel is a design load case imposing highest load factors on the fuel tank. This is critical for the fuel tank design and it can be critical also for the wing structure since in this scenario the highest inertia load on the fuel tank introduces torsion about the shear centre in the same direction of the wing aerodynamic load of the wing (the CG of the fuel is forward to the shear centre which is forward to the wing centre of pressure). Maximum zero wing fuel weight WZWF (600kg) The maximum zero wing fuel weight needs to be determined by requirement 5.2.1.3  and is a design load case for the wing loads due to lowest inertia discharge of the wing structure. In this aeroplane this weight equals the Maximum Take-off weight.  Maximum take-off weight WMTOW (600kg) The total aircraft weight must not exceed 600kg regardless whether the aircraft is on ground or in flight. The gross weight of the aeroplane shall not exceed WMTOW = 600kg. The maximum landing weight equals the maximum take-off weight. Loading cases The following loading conditions have been established to identify the critical cases. Table 3 – Loading cases for standard configuration   Centre of gravity location The maximum permissible centre of gravity locations are defined within this chapter. Flight limits The maximum permissible centre of gravity range during flight with respect to datum plane is most forward 0.25m   (required by  4.2.3) most rearward 0.39m   (required by  4.2.3) Limitations on ground The most rearward centre of gravity with the plane on ground must not exceed (with respect to datum plane) 0.46m to prevent the aircraft from flipping on the tail although not more than 0.41m might be reached with the most critical loading configuration. Centre of gravity envelope The following table of load cases defines the limits for the certified envelope of centre of gravity locations and the position of load cases of 6.7 within the envelope. Table 4 – Load cases on centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration   The centre of gravity envelope covers all valid loading cases.  Figure 1 – Centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration Expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification To cover alterations to the aeroplane where need might arise or after certification the aeroplane will be tested and certified against an extended envelope. Additional weights will be added during testing at their corresponding locations to establish the desired loading cases. Table 5 – Weights required to achieve expanded envelope for certification   The expanded centre of gravity envelope is defined by the load cases below using ballast weights at their corresponding locations. Table 6 – Load cases on expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification Note: The values above are preliminary assumptions. Ballast weights need to be checked to be in accordance with airframe strength limitations and their impact on the flight characteristics in terms of inertia before test flights. This might require narrowing the centre of gravity envelope.

the solution to given in with good understanding of the monitoring process and the interactions among the variables airlines heir own problem diagnosing and cruise performance monitoring has been used for many years by airlines that strive to operate their airplanes as as these airlines know that continuous cruise performance monitoring of airplanes in their can decrease operating costs relative to airlines that do not monitor airplane performance continuous cruise performance monitoring can give airlines the information they need just the baseline performance levels they use for planning and management computer mc fuel predictions so that the correct amount of fuel is loaded on each and every entify normal deterioration for of ch the airplanes that perform best to their longest entify

performance problems or these case studies show how cruise performance monitoring was used to determine solutions to three different an airline that operates airplane was concerned about what it considered to be ive fuel mileage deterioration relative to the fuel mileage levels its airplanes exhibited when they were the airline requested help from both boeing and the engine manufacturer in te mining what was causing this deterioration the the or through better understanding of the contributions that airframe and engine deterioration make to the overall fuel mileage the airline could more focus its maintenance to help resolve this the airline proposed an experiment involving an engine exchange airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration airframe versus engine causes of fuel mileage deterioration by dave flight operations and carolyn aerodynamics engineer aero quarterly ew total fuel mileage diff ence ol to ne airplane using he ol an ne engine between an old and new six which was operating about percent below the planning database level of fuel represented the old while soon represented the new the airline requested assistance and support from boeing and the engine manufacturer in carrying out the which sure pre fuel mileage on both the new and the old airplane swap all four engines between the new and old sure fuel mileage again on both the new and the old airplane by using the same physical set of four engines on two different the and the engine manufacturer agreed that any measurable difference in fuel mileage for the same set of engines on two different airframes could be attributed to airframe effects alone that drag position was that proper maintenance of the exterior of an airplane would lead to minimal amounts of drag deterioration as an airplane as the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including so that it would be considered as having properly maintained exterior before the engine control surfaces were seals were and one engine was minor leak in the pneumatic discovered during the was not by the airline to cause about percent penalty in fuel fuel mileage data was collected before and after the to determine any change across the especially to quantify any changes resulting from rigging the control surfaces and replacing any worn fuel mileage improved percent after the with percent attributed to proper rigging of the controls and percent attributed to the changing of one fuel mileage data was then collected on both the old and new airplanes before and after the engine the data collected was combination of in data collected by the airplane condition monitoring system acm and hand data that was collected under more controlled test average results from all four sets of data were then compared to determine the differences in fuel mileage between the old and new airplanes with the same set of for both the old and new the average improvement in fuel mileage for the new airframe relative to the old airframe was about the initial conclusion could be that the older airframe must contribute about percent toward the overall fuel mileage deterioration originally observed on the old airplane and engine about percent of that difference is of the total calculated difference of the pneumatic duct leakage discovered on the old airplane during the contributed about in the old airplane did not have the same revised vertical fairing as the new if the older airplane had had the newer vertical it is estimated that the fuel mileage would have improved about after adjusting for the pneumatic system leak and the newer vertical for the same set of engines the old fuel mileage averaged about percent worse than the new the results are supportive of the position that the drag deterioration of well airplane most likely will not exceed more than about the experiment began by putting the old airplane through complete including ration ne vertical fin fairing pneumatic leakage actual unexplainable diff ence case study to help determine the primary cause of the fuel mileage boeing and the airline collected fuel mileage data on both new and old before and after an engine an airline expressed concern to boeing that its new airplanes equipped with aviation partners boeing apb blended winglets were exhibiting fuel mileage performance more than percent worse than the boeing database while its winglet approximately two years displayed fuel mileage performance similar to the database the which collects cruise fuel mileage data on an ongoing based its analysis on acm cruise fuel mileage data analyzed using the boeing airplane performance monitoring apm in initial discussions between boeing and the it was explained that the database being used by the airline to represent the with blended winglets was based on the original winglet test results completed in early this is the same database used in the flight crew operations the mc and the operational planning additional tests had led to best assessment of the delivered performance of the which showed slightly less improvement than the original this revised based on several add al test programs conducted in and includes different winglet drag increment to winglet and an aer elastic correction absent in the earlier at mach the difference between the two databases varies from percent to depending on the exact conditions with the database predicting better fuel mileage increment because of the winglets in all upon the airline provided boeing with acm data for two of its airplanes with blended boeing analyzed the data for each airplane using both the operational database and the revised while the data on about percent closer to the newer database level than the operational database analysis did not agree with the analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the further discussions with the airline revealed that it had been using passenger weight allo of kg per including carry and kg per checked bag for all of its as of june the airline changed to the higher passenger weight allowances recommended in the joint aviation requirements operations ar checked baggage would be weighed whenever ar checked baggage weight allowances would be the average passenger weight allowances are higher than the kg per passenger the airline had been because the data sent to boeing for the two winglet airplanes was collected prior to june it was based on the lighter weight allowance of kg per investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall investigation of cruise fuel mileage shortfall analysis of the data using the revised database concluded that two of the airplanes appeared to display fuel mileage performance about percent below the latest boeing winglet level even more than the percent originally suggested by the aero quarterly the analysis was based on data using combination of the weight as the investigation the airline sent additional data to boeing for the same two winglet airplanes but only for conditions recorded after june based on the higher jar weight the airline also included data for one more winglet as well as for three winglet the data for the two winglet airplanes showed an immediate fuel mileage improvement of about percent for each based on analyzing only the data from ar weight allowances collected after june this result led quickly to the belief that the previous kg per passenger weight allowance was too although both the fuel mileage and thrust required changed between data based on kg per passenger and data based on ar passenger weight the thrust fuel consumption tsf hardly errors in the estimated weight of an airplane present themselves as high or low drag but do not affect the fuel tsf deviations calculated by apm improvement was observed for both of the winglet airplanes originally analyzed with data recorded before june the results for all six airplanes were still not as good as what boeing experience indicated for this further investigation determined that this airline operates its of in mix of both scheduled and holiday charter using the ar weight allowances called out for the data sent to boeing for the six airplanes included mixture of data from both these types of the average passenger weight allowance recommended for scheduled service is kg per passenger and kg per passenger for charter service are higher than the kg per passenger originally used by the at the airline separated all of the post june data into two charter service and scheduled the data for each group was reanalyzed separately and the analysis revealed discrepancy in demonstrated fuel mileage and thrust levels between the charter and scheduled if airplane weight is perceived airplane performance will be poorer than weight that is unaccounted for shows up as increased airplane drag and decreased fuel in this the tsf deviations remained consistent between both sets of but the thrust deviations increased for the charter strong indication of unaccounted airplane in this boeing proposed that the jar passenger weight allowances as recommended for holiday charter were underestimating the airplane weight for this particular charter although the airline was receptive to the possibility that the ar passenger weight allowances might be too light for its holiday charter it was not fully the airline believed that the ar weight allowances for scheduled could just as easily be in which case their airplanes were performing as poorly as the charter data to determine which weight allowances were the airline and boeing agreed to collect delivery performance data on the next new airplane with production blended winglets the advantages of collecting delivery data as opposed to in data he performance level of the airplane could be established at he airplane would be weighed at the boeing factory with all the weight changes following weighing but preceding delivery accurately tracked and published in the weight and balance the delivery empty weight could be considered delivery are with minimum so the issue of passenger weight allowances would not after collecting cruise performance data on the delivery the airline would continue with its standard in data collection on both scheduled and charter comparing the results from the delivery with the results obtained in would help determine which jar passenger weight allowances gave the airline more accurate airplane gross if the weight allowances were too heavy airplane was actually lighter than then the in performance would appear to be better than the delivery if the weight allowances were too light airplane was heavier than then the in performance would appear to be worse than the delivery the airline provided boeing with the weeks of acm in data for the airplane following separating the data for charter and scheduled for this the data was analyzed relative to the most recent with winglets although the delivery results showed the airplane to be slightly better than the demonstrated database the early in charter results show the airplane with an average per fuel mileage percent worse than the demonstrated level unaccounted weight shows up as airplane drag according to the charter the airplane experienced percent increase in thrust required on entering partially offset by percent drop in engine tsf for percent drop in fuel mileage from the delivery when the same ai scheduled service data for the same time period was the fuel mileage was much closer to the delivery average in fuel mileage for the weeks of operation deviated from the delivery level by only percent percent below the demonstrated which is within the acm ability to determine fuel mileage over given time these results supported the conclusion for this the ar passenger weight allo for scheduled more accurately the true weight of the passengers plus carry baggage than the weight allowances recommended for the charter in both are much more representative than the original kg per passenger the airline had been the weight allowances for scheduled of kg per passenger produce more accurate zero fuel weight buildup and truer representation of the actual performance of the with or without the results of this case study airplane weight buildup issue for this particular boeing suggested that the jar holiday charter passenger weight allowances appeared to be too light for this with unaccounted weight showing up as excess airplane thrust required using the ar passenger weight allowances for scheduled the fuel mileage performance for its with and without

data was based on the production reinforced the two sets of data were analyzed separately in order to identify any differences in the improvement based on differences in the baseline before the winglets were boeing analyzed the data for all airplanes using the same in software tools used to analyze boeing these software tools are different from the apm software provided to airline but the analysis produces basically the same the main difference is that the boeing in software normalizes the data points to nominal weight to pressure ratios chosen by boeing while the apm software does the improvements were plotted versus in order to illustrate that the magnitude of the improvement depends on for given mach this dependency on is because the winglet improvement is function of airplane

process was followed for each and for the various sets of data and analysis of the data indicated slight improvement in drag and fuel mileage that resulted from the reinforcement of the wing the results indicated this improve to be relatively small but still worth an average of few tenths of percentage at normal cruise weights and including the effects of both the wing strengthening and the addition of the the fuel mileage and drag improve closely matched their predicted because the improvement in drag is of for given cruise the actual improvement in fuel mileage that the airline would

to show boeing has continually made enhancements to the and delivery of its service past enhancements include digital and tabular work boeing has been working directly with airlines to reduce end costs for service bulletin during this it was observed that when airlines create their engineering they rewrite or engineer service bulletins and kit or repackage the kit of parts to match their own engineering this engineering causes unnecessary delays and expense for the airlines in implementing service boeing developed the enhanced service also known as the generation service to minimize this engineering effort while making it easier and less expensive to implement service the enhanced service in conjunction with airline process will enable smooth ensuring that and tools are staged in coordinated manner to support the mechanic during service bulletin enhanced service bulletins incorporate four key lean work faster access to essential improved kit and selective information these

optimum material for applications throughout the the result is an airframe comprising nearly half carbon reinforced plastic and other this approach offers weight savings on average of percent compared to more conventional aluminum selecting the optimum material for application meant analyzing every area of the airframe to determine the best given the operating environment and loads that component experiences over the life of the for aluminum is sensitive to tension loads but handles compression very on the other composites are not as in dealing with compression loads but are excellent at handling the expanded use of especially in the highly tension environment of the greatly reduces maintenance due to fatigue when compared with an aluminum this type of analysis has resulted in an increased use of titanium as where loading indicates metal is preferred material system but environmental considerations indicate aluminum is poor titanium is an excellent low design titanium can withstand comparable loads better than has minimal fatigue con and is highly resistant to titanium use has been expanded on the to roughly percent of the total every structural element of the has undergone this type of life analysis and material types are based on thorough and disciplined selection how co mpo si te lu are app li ed thro ug ho ut the in addition to using robust structural design in the has been designed with the capability to be repaired in exactly the same manner that airlines would repair an airplane today with bolted these can be just as permanent and damage tolerant as they are on metal in addition to lowering the overall airplane moving to composite primary structure promises to reduce both the scheduled and nonroutine maintenance burden on the reduced scheduled per ence with the boeing proves that composite require less scheduled maintenance than noncom for the composite tail is percent larger than the aluminum yet requires percent fewer scheduled maintenance labor this labor hour reduction is due to the result of reduced risk of corrosion and fatigue of composites compared with reduced nonroutine com structure also results in less nonroutine the structure is all composite and highlights the advantages of this material when applied in harsh environ airline operators are aware of the fatigue cracking and corrosion experienced with traditional aluminum the model has been for more than years with more than airplanes in the and to date has not replaced single composite boeing has also implemented rigorous process for evaluating the use of aluminum that combines likelihood of corrosion with consequence of this scoring system provides measure for establishing acceptable application of aluminum in the design with full understanding of the maintenance corrosion and fatigue in structure add to the nonroutine maintenance burden on an nonroutine maintenance frequently or even triples the total labor hours expended during maintenance with the expanded use of composites and titanium combined with greater discipline in usage of boeing expects the to have much lower nonroutine labor costs than more conventional metallic in addition to using robust structural design in damage such as passenger and cargo the has been designed from the start with the capability to be repaired in exactly the same manner that airlines would repair an airplane today with bolted the ability to perform bolted repairs in composite structure is service on the and offers comparable repair times and skills as employed on metallic by bolted repairs in composite structure can be permanent and damage just as they can be on metal in airlines have the option to perform bonded composite which offer improved aerodynamic and aesthetic these repairs are damage and do not require an while typical bonded repair may require or more hours of airplane boeing has taken advantage of the properties of composites to develop new line of maintenance repair capability that requires less the right material for the right without preconceived boeing engineers were able to specify the optimum material for applications throughout the aero quarterly than an hour to this rapid composite repair technique offers temporary repair capability to get an airplane again despite minor damage that might ground an aluminum in the reduced risk of corrosion and fatigue associated with composites combined with the com repair techniques described will lower overall maintenance costs and maximize airline revenue by keeping airplanes as much as the boeing completely new approach to onboard virtually everything that has traditionally been powered by bleed from the engines has been transitioned to an electric the affected systems gine start ry power unit apu start wing ice protection bin pressurization hydraulic pumps the only remaining bleed system on the is the anti system for the engine while much can be said regarding the gains achieved by changing the means of extracting power for airplane systems from the the no architecture brings with it some sig maintenance cost and reliability advantages as by eliminating the pneumatic systems from the the will realize notable reduction in the mechanical complexity of airplane the list below highlights just few of the compo eliminated as result of this systems neumatic engine and apu start motors apu load compressor coolers various and air control systems eak and overheat detection systems auxiliary power the apu provides an excellent illustration of the be of the more one of the primary functions of conventional apu is driving large pneumatic load replacing the pneumatic load compressor with starter generators results in improved start reliability and power the use of starter generators reduces maintenance requirements and increases reliability due to the simpler design and lower parts in terms of start the apu is expected to be approximately four times more reliable than conventional apu with pneumatic load electrical power another funda tal architectural change on the is the use of variable frequency electrical power and the integration of the engine generator and starter functions into single this change enables elimination of the constant speed drive known as the integrated drive greatly reducing the complexity of the in addi by using the engine generator as

it to the maximum great way to get to know the kln is to use it outside the using what we call the are products available which allow you to use the kln at your or hotel to have time in the for instance the commander from lone star it is also helpful to do flight planning and perform data base updates outside the perhaps with home personal more information on the commander or to place an

whatever tion it is initialized to on the setup page section and time to first in ground speed and heading may be entered on the set page and the kln will track flight plan or direct to point just as if it was actually functioning in an distances count points and the tion bar follows the progress of the simulated using the mode is an excellent way to learn the operation of the kln without worrying about the engine other or even these phenomena are not simulated in the kln approaches and and approaches and this is the last chapter on the operation of the kln in this chapter you will learn how to use the kln for approach and note that only kln which are configured for ifr approaches are capable of performing the procedures discussed in this kln which are figured for en route and terminal operations only will give you access to procedures but not all of these procedures require that you are comfortable with the operation of the unit as presented up to this in you need to be comfortable with flight plan operation and and the obs mode approach operations flying approaches using the kln are not in selves very it is different than using traditional equipment such as and with this in make sure that you practice with the kln in vfr weather with check pilot before attempting to use the kln in actual ifr the kln obtains approach information from the data it is extremely important that the data base is the kln is approved for ifr approaches only when the data base is if you attempt to select an approach when the data base is out of you will be given the base in the bottom left portion of the screen as following sections assume that your kln is installed in the aircraft with all of the necessary accessories to fly in most cases this will mean that the craft has external to arm the approach an external annunciator to indicate when message is active and when point sequencing is about to occur will also be in some installations the aircraft will have switch to select which navigation source is displayed on the primary hsi or nav page has been specifically designed to provide most the functions needed for this page an interface that presents pertinent navigation way to access the flight and graphic presentation of the sent position relative to the flight plan you will find this page to be good friend while performing gps based approaches and and there are some approach procedures in the world that not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data therefore it is not possible to use the kln for these it is good flight practice ensure that the kln contains anticipated procedures for the addition to the two course modes and described in there are also two approach these are approach arm and approach the status of the approach mode is ed on an external in most installations the external annunciator will indicate for the approach arm and approach active will be annunciated by the main ence of these modes from the normal en route mode is that the integrity monitoring is set to tighter another difference between these modes and the en route mode is that the cdi scale factor will usually change to nm for arm and will always change to nm when in the apr the arm mode can be selected in two the normal way is that this mode will be selected automatically by the kln when the aircraft is within nm of an airport and an approach is loaded in the flight plan for that it is possible to arm the approach mode at distance greater than nm from the airport by pressing the al gps approach but the kln will not change the cdi scale factor until the aircraft reaches the nm if the gps apr external switch is pressed while the approach mode is then the kln will disarm the approach and change back to en route the cdi scale factor will also change back to the approach can be by simply pressing the gps apr switch the apr mode can only be engaged automatically by the to cancel the apr mode press the external gps apr this will change the mode to apr once past the it is not possible to return to the approach active mode without missed approach and flying back to the procedure for approaches approaches will all have the general flow of events refer to figure and load the approach into the flight can one at almost any time but must be completed before reaching the final approach fix and should be done as soon as kln approaches and and corresponds to point in figure if the aircraft is greater than nm from the then the cdi scale factor will remain at the default nm full scale to the approach arm this will occur when the aircraft is within nm of the airport and there is an approach loaded into the flight plan in ure the cdi scale factor will change to nm over the next seconds and the external

procedure when is and the active point is the and you have flown past the map number in section necessary conduct the missed approach remember to always refer to the paper chart when conducting missed the obs mode is usually needed at some point during missed approach and is always required to fly the holding pattern in figure details of the above operations as well as several examples how to conduct approaches using the kln are given in the following and and selecting an the first item in the list from the previous section is to select and load the approach into the active flight approaches are selected from the apt act page of the airport for which you desire to shoot the if you are operating from flight the est way to get to the approach information is by turning to the act page for your destination as described in section following example will use the vor or gps rwy to los angeles international airport select and load an into the active flight plan to one of the apt pages and select lax by using the and outer knobs the right inner knob to turn to the apt if you ed lax from the apt page turn the inner knob one click to reach the apt the cursor on by pressing the cursor comes up on the first approach in the list of use the right outer knob to move the cursor to different approaches if there are more than approaches to an airport you can move the sor down to the other procedures into view by rotating the right outer the flashing cursor over vor kln will present list of initial approach fixes corresponding to this in this example we want the select this by pressing when the cursor over if there is only one iaf for then the kln skip this step and go on to the next approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl

route of flight that you if you expect radar then the selection of the correct iaf is less important because you will be given vectors to the and will not need to use the kln next presents list of points that make up the review these points to make sure that you have selected the correct if there are more than four points in the approach you can move the cursor up to other points into view by rotating the right outer knob the cursor over add pl and kln will then bring up the pl page and put the sequence of approach points in front of the airport reference point any time during the process of selecting an approach can easily return to the previous step by pressing the points that make up the approach procedure are loaded the flight at the top of the list of approach points is that describes the approach that an example of this is shown on line of figure which indicates that the vor approach for los angeles international airport is in the active flight plan the approach has been entered into the flight plan the kln to make sure that the resulting flight plan if the kln detects any points that are in both the en route tion of the flight plan and the portion that makes up the

figure kln approaches and and the flight plan and delete those en route points that not can only be entered into pl the active if the kln is turned off for more than then the approach is deleted when power is turned back interpreting what you in the example you may have noticed couple of swith somewhat strange the second point of the approach has name that is not normal for this is an example of what are called these are points that are associated with specific they are used to define spot on the ground that does not have normal point in the case of this point is nm from the lax vor on the the fifth point in the approach is another type of terminal in this case this point is the missed approach point for runway this approach applies to both the left and right runways so the letter is used to mean are few other types of terminal points that you will need tobe familiar with to fully understand gps the naming convention for these points are as stands for final approach stands for intermediate stands for course stands for missed approach rw stands for runway this is usually the map for the zzz will be runway number possibly including for for for or for stands for dme arc aaa is the radial that the fix is on from the reference will be letter corresponding to the distance from the reference for is the seventh letter of the alphabet so would be point on the nm from the reference dme arcs greater than nm will have points where the first two characters are the first two letters of the dme the next three characters will be the radial that the arc way point is the rules above and are defined as for runways only one will be replaced with an or for ways that have multiple will be replaced with for for or for the letters will be replaced with either the runway identifier for circling the inbound course to the missed approach point along given radial will be named such that the first letters are the reference and the next two are the dme if the distance is greater than nm the order is for is nm from lax while is nm from the aircraft is not too far from the destination the nav can be used to determine where some of these points are relative to others in the at the time of this all of the nos charts and some en charts do not show the special points that are required for gps for this reason it is good idea to understand what the special points are used for and what they may have also noticed that some points have small at the end of the point the small letter is an aid that we have added to the name of some points to help you recognize important points in the these suffixes are displayed on many of the kln the definitions of these suffixes the initial approach fix of the the final approach fix of the approach the missed approach point of the approach the missed approach holding point for the every approach will have and almost all will have an iaf and missed approach holding another item that you should notice the flight plan is the line that has on it this is what is referred to as fence and the purpose of this line is to tell you approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and kln will not automatically sequence past the point precedes the the point before the fence is always the missed approach the reason that point sequencing is not allowed is that many missed approach procedures require specific actions before going to the missed approach holding point climbing on fixed heading until reaching an changing or deleting an approach loaded into the flight the sequence of points that are retrieved from the data base of the kln define the approach procedures as they are to ensure that the proper path over the ground is it is not possible to either delete or add points to the approach section of the flight to help you see which points are en route points and which are approach the kln does not display colon next to the point number on the pl page if the point is an approach it is only possible to replace the existing approach with another delete the entire approach from the flight replace an existing or delete an the left page displaying the active flight plan turn the cursor on by pressing the cursor so that it covers the approach header at the top the approach once the cursor comes over the approach it will automatically change to read if you in this condition the kln bring up the apt page that corresponds to the current at this point it is ble to select different approach different or you press the button the cursor is over the approach header it will change to read delete if you press the kln vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and remove the entire approach procedure from the active flight if the kln was in the approach arm or the approach active then deleting the approach will cause the kln to change back to en route this means that the cdi scale factor will change back to the default nm example no procedure turn now that you know the basics of inserting an approach into the we can now show the approach operation of the unit by several this first example will use the approach that was loaded into the flight plan in section this example will show how the kln sequences through an approach and what type of and scale factor changes can be the kln will remain in the familiar leg mode so there will be no need to change between leg and obs mode in this refer to the approach plate for this approach to see what the procedure looks this example it is assumed that you are on an active flight with the final destination being the los angeles international it is also assumed that atc will not give you radar vectors during this the vor approach to lax as demonstrated in tion you are within nm of the the kln will ically arm the approach mode and provide the following alt to set the message acts as reminder to make sure the kln is the correct barometric if the barometric information is not then the integrity monitoring provided by the kln will not be as good as it could press to bring up the alt page verify that the barometric pressure is if the kln is interfaced with compatible air data that provides the correct barometric pressure to the kln then the previous message is not displayed and it is not necessary to update the barometric this time the kln will smoothly change the cdi scale factor the external approach annunciator installed in the aircraft will indicate that the approach is in the arm kln approaches and and you approach the kln will provide point alerting on the external annunciator as well as on the screen of the kln once you pass the kln will ically sequence to the next point in the approaches and and may be good time to select the nav this page is especially useful for getting feeling of where you are in the approach the aircraft approaches the the kln will again provide point as the aircraft passes and sequences to the kln will provide message telling you to set the external indicator or to new if desired track is shown on the this value will flash when the external selected course does not match the tk within the aircraft approaches the it is good idea to check over the status of the kln look at the kln screen to verify that leg sequencing is the kln will not transition to the approach active mode if the obs mode is if the kln shares an hsi or cdi with other nav it is also good to verify that the switch is set to the time the aircraft is nm from by the final approach the kln will make prediction to see if integrity will be available at the and at the if the diction indicates that integrity monitoring will be and aim is currently the kln will change the gps apr annunciator to read at this time the kln will also start to change the cdi scale by the time the aircraft reaches the the cdi scale factor will be down to fix is not included in the list of points provided in the data you will need to identify this point by using the along track distances given in the profile view of the approach in this example is located nm from the when the distance to is then the aircraft is at and you can descend to the for this approach procedures require that you add up distances to be able to identify step down vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and kln will again provide point alerting as you approach this is shown on the nav page by flashing active point identifier following steps would need to be performed if missed approach is reaching and not seeing the runway you decide to perform missed the kln will not automatically sequence past the missed approach this is shown on the nav page by not showing any lines connecting points that are past the to perform the published missed approach press to bring up the the default point will be the first point of the missed approach in this case the first point is confirm this point as the direct to point and press reaching the kln will sequence to the next point in the missed approach in this there is no holding pattern published for the missed approach so you can expect further instructions upon reaching atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th example an approach that is quite common is an approach that is based off fan an example of this is the vor rwy approach to clovis new mexico municipal to fly this procedure as published use the following steps and refer to figure for the for this example assume that the aircraft approaches and and approaching from the northeast going the clovis airport with no active flight the approach into the flight plan as described in section in this case there is only one iaf so the kln does not present the option for you to select an in this there is no active flight plan to begin with so the kln will ask to add the approach to pl the area atc tells you to go the vor and clears you for the approach to this is easy to do from the nav page by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning through the active flight plan by turning the inner once is displayed in the scanning window press and then to direct to operation to the distance of nm to the the kln will give the following required select this message provides reminder that to fly course reversal obs mode needs to be note from the approach chart that there is opt arrival sector for this if you are ing within the indicated area there is no need to perform course reversal and you need to ignore this the opt sector is not stored in the data base so it is not possible for the kln to know if course reversal is required or as the kln will always give this message whenever point could be used for course the kln will properly sequence to the to map leg and transition to the approach mode when nm from the you are approaching from any other direction course reversal is required and the obs mode will need to be if the obs mode is not selected before reaching then the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach this is not desirable when performing course reversal so the obs mode must be selected before reaching the kln will only remind you to select obs mode if iaf is the active therefore if course reversal is make sure the iaf is the selected approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and course reversal is then upon reaching perform the appropriate holding pattern entry and set the inbound course on the external cdi or in this example the inbound course is at this point the kln works very similar to al established on the inbound course of switch back the leg when leg mode is selected the is cally made the active point when the iaf and the are at the same is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor this will make the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active the aircraft is nm from the the kln will verify that the proper integrity is if integrity monitoring is available for the then the kln will change to the approach active this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to reaching the kln will automatically sequence to the missed approach fix at dme from along the final approach course is not included in the points that come from the data since the distance that the kln is giving you is distance the you will need to mentally figure out when the has reached this is done by looking at the along distances given in the plan view of the in this case the fix is nm from upon reaching this distance you can descend to the for this missed approach is required for this then the steps would be published missed approach procedure for this approach is to make climbing left turn to feet and proceed direct to the in this case will be the default direct to point kln approaches and and is this is the desired point so press to confirm the point and proceed direct to the if atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to the aircraft approaches you will need to select obs mode to stop point sequencing and define the inbound course for the holding if you do not select the obs mode before the aircraft is within nm of the holding then the kln presents message reminding you to select the obs another attempt at the approach is desired after itis necessary to manually change the active when the and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active point to the when you change from obs to make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active example radar for this example we will use the same approach that was used in previous section except this approach will be conducted with the help of radar vectors from approach the aircraft will be assumed to be arriving from the although this does not change the way the approach will be flown using the kln approach has been selected and entered into the flight plan and the aircraft is going direct to vn new mexico as described in section soon as atc mentions radar vectors you should immediately start to think of the obs once given radar change the active point to and select the obs note that it is not important what order these events take it is just as effective to change to obs mode and then change the active point as it is to change the active point and then switch to obs change the selected course on the cdi or hsi to the final approach for this the inbound course is is now possible to watch your progress on the nav page and anticipate when you will be given new headings to fly established on the inbound you will need to change back to the leg mode to allow for proper approach operation and automatic leg for best the change back to leg mode should be made before the aircraft is nm from the it is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the scale factor this will make the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active rest of this approach would be flown using the same steps as presented in section and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure kln approaches and and example another common type of approach is an approach that is based onan these could be either vor or ndb an example of this type of approach is the vor rwy approach to bowman airport in kentucky the airport identifier for this airport is approaches and and this example assume that the aircraft is approaching lou the nabb passing the nabb you are told to expect the vor

scale factor will transition to nm and the kln will provide more sensitive integrity you also press to update the barometric the aircraft is nm from the qm the kln will give message reminding you to select the obs the obs mode is required for the procedure after passing select the outbound course of the external cdi or aircraft is now headed outbound for the procedure as soon you will need to change the active point to the final approach this is done by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning until is displayed in the dow then pressing then pressing the course will still be what is ed on the external cdi or hsi the obs mode selected and as the active it is possible to fly the procedure allow enough distance past to complete the procedure turn and still be nm away before reaching the after completing the outbound portion of the procedure change the selected course to the inbound course of the external cdi or established on the inbound course the leg mode will again need to be selected so that proper approach operation and point sequencing will is mandatory that the unit be in leg mode with the the active point before crossing the to activate the approach active mode and change to nm scale the cdi scale tor changes from nm to nm over the two miles to the delaying the switch from obs to leg mode compresses the apt vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th kln approaches and and this makes the transition more if the switch from obs to leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the kln to change to the approach active the aircraft is nm from the the kln will verify that the proper gps integrity is if integrity monitoring is available for the then the kln will change to the approach active this will be annunciated on the external approach status annunciator as well as on the kln the cdi scale factor will also start to change from nm to point alerting will occur as the aircraft passes the final approach the leg from the final approach fix to the missed approach point will become active and the cdi scale factor will remain at if the auto scale factor was selected on the nav then the scale factor will zoom in on the airport as the aircraft gets closer and closer to the missed approach eventually the map scale changes to following steps are followed if missed approach is missed approach instructions call for climbing left turn to heading of intercepting the course to missed approach holding to fly this with the kln it will be necessary to put the kln into the obs mode and make the active change the selected course on the external cdi or hsi to the aircraft reaches you will need to perform holding pattern entry suitable for this holding pattern and set the selected course to the holding example dme dme arc procedures with the kln are completely different using traditional vor and dme worry because dme arc procedures using the kln are also easier than using traditional this is because the kln guidance around the no more having to watch distance in one place and radial in being dme arc is really whole bunch of approach fixes placed one next to each other to form an very rarely do you actually fly to the beginning of an especially in radar the flight path of the aircraft generally intersects the arc at some once the aircraft is near the it is then possible to turn so that the arc distance is maintained until time to turn to the inbound following example will show how dme arc procedures are using the kln this example approach will be to use the vor rwy approach to the approach plate for this approach is in figure assume that the aircraft is approaching from the north and is in radar assigns the vor rwy turn to the apt page for to select the you select the vor approach and the kln sents the iaf selection page are five choices for the three of these choices you can recognize but the other and are ar and not shown on this these two points are the data base identifiers for the ends of the means dme arc is the radial on which the point and cates the distance of the is the twelfth letter of the alphabet so the indicates that this is dme in similar manner can also be in this example the aircraft is approaching from the north so the iaf will be kln knows that this point is associated with dme once an arc point is the kln determines what radial of the reference vor the aircraft is presently located point is created that is located at the intersection of the sent radial and the dme this point is the first point in the list of points presented on the apt page before approaches and and vor

will default to the beginning of the approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure the kln does not take into account the try of the active flight plan when determining the arc intercept this point is defined solely on the present radial and the defined arc distance from the reference for this reason it is better to delay selecting approaches that contain dme arcs until the aircraft is closer to the the cursor over add to pl press the approach will be loaded into the active flight plan just like any other approach would the approach is loaded into the flight plan the kln may give the pts in edit en route pts as this message is given because very often it will be necessary it the active flight plan to ensure that proper point ing examine the flight plan if observe the nav page to make sure that the sequence of points does not have any unnecessary legs in kln will now provide guidance to the arc intercept the nav page displays the entire arc on the the tion that is between the beginning of the arc and the arc intercept is drawn with dashed the part that is between the arc ept point and the end of the arc is drawn with the normal solid line some cases atc may provide radar vectors to the the kln provides means to define new intercept point based on the current track of the aircraft over the this can be done from either the nav page or from the pl the dashed line displayed on the nav page will help you to mine if atc is giving you correct the nav pull out the right inner knob to bring up the point scanning the right inner knob until the first point of the arc is in this for approaches this will have small appended to the point if the recalculation is to be done from the pl then turn on the cursor and move it over the first point of the and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure either page press this will change the point to read if it is desired to recompute the arc intercept point then press if new arc intercept point is not desired then press was then kln will calculate an arc intercept point based on the present track of the aircraft over the the present track does not intercept the then kln will display no tin the scratchpad area of the the aircraft approaches the arc the kln will provide point alerting and turn anticipation to join the established on the arc the kln provides ance relative to the curved distance to the active point is the distance from the present position to the active not the distance along the refer to appendix for the geometry of the the the desired track will be constantly to help you keep the orientation correct the nav page will ically display tk on the fourth it is not possible to change this to something else while on the the value played for the desired track will flash when the difference between the cdi or hsi and the current desired track is greater than dme arcs have defined radials that serve as step down these points are not stored in the data to help you determine your position relative to these points along the the kln will display new value in the bottom right corner of the display on the nav this new bit of tion is denoted by the letters arc followed by three three numbers represent the current radial that you are on relative to the reference the arc radial is forced into this position when the aircraft is nm from the the display is shown in figure just watch this value and when it reads the same as one of the points you can descend as this particular example does not have such but there are quite few approaches that approaches and and vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure approaches and and performance may not be satisfactory if coupled the nav mode while flying the many autopilots were never designed to fly curved if autopilot performance is not tory while flying dme select the mode and keep changing the heading bug to keep the the aircraft approaches the end of the the kln will provide point alerting and turn anticipation to the next the aircraft is nm from fow the the kln will attempt to transition to the approach active since the dme arc procedure is flown entirely in the leg mode the only possible problem would be if the integrity monitoring did not check visual descent point is identified by the along track ance to the map to be when the aircraft reaches this point and the way environment is in it is possible to descend for missed approach is needed use the following missed approach calls for climb to and then left turn direct to the kln will not automatically sequence past the feet has been reached press the approach holding point will be the default direct to press to confirm the direct to point and proceed to the fow atc gives you instructions for missed approach that different from the published missed approach it is always possible for you to select different direct to point than the default direct to obs mode will need to be selected to accomplish the ing if this is not done before the aircraft is nm from the kln will provide message reminding you to select the obs vor ndb int usr act nav pl cal set th figure another attempt at the approach is desired after itis necessary to manually change the active when the and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the kln will automatically change the active point to the when you change from obs to make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active approach very rarely there will be problem with the integrity of the gps tem while you are conducting approaches with the kln in some cases the kln will determine that there will not be sufficient integrity monitoring for the leg between the and the or aim is not currently in these cases the kln will not go into the approach active mode and will present the ing not apr mode inhibited predict aim on th these cases you will not be able to finish the approach there is insufficient integrity the th page provides means for you to predict when aim will be to perform aim prediction on the th page two pieces of ation are the first is the location that the prediction will be for and the second is the time for the destination point by be the missed point of an approach loaded in the flight if there is no approach in the flight then the default point is the last point in the active flight of course it is possible for you to enter any point in this time used for the aim prediction will be the current eta to the destination airport or the this time is automatically updated by the kln so there is usually no need to enter if you are making aim calculation for planning it is also possible to enter time in this an important point about this time is that the time used for aim prediction is always in the future and limited to hours from the present for if the time is now and the time entered for the eta is then the prediction will be made for the next day not one hour approaches and and to perform manual aim the left outer and inner knobs to select the th the cursor will be over the aim the desired point identifier by using the inner and outer knobs just like you do for any other point the desired point identifier is entered press press again the point information is cursor will now be over the eta use the inner knob to enter the desired note that the current time zone is displayed next to the eta use the outer knob to move the cursor over the minutes use the inner and outer knobs to select tens of minutes and single utes as when the desired time is selected press aim calculations will aim calculation will usually take few seconds before an answer is during this time the th page will be as shown in figure the aim calculation is the th page will cate the results of the example is shown in figure and aim is available from minutes before eta until minutes after aim is ed not to be available from then until minutes after the by showing the times when aim will be available it is possible for you to how to alter your eta to ensure that there will not be any aim more rare will be the case the kln cannot provide sufficient integrity monitoring or if there is an

instrument and stars terminal arrival by procedures stored in the data base can only be considered accurate as long as the data base is even though the data base contains sid and star there is lot of information that is not included in the data the paper chart is still the primary source of for many procedures require the aircraft to fly to certain along heading until intercepting and many other procedures that the kln can not automatically many procedures require pilot action to ensure that the proper path is flown over the the main purpose of loading sid or star into the active flight plan is to provide you with quick way of loading potentially large number of and star procedures can be as challenging to fly as some approaches therefore it is mandatory that you are comfortable with the operation of the kln before attempting to fly sid and star in flight plan operation and the obs mode should be second nature to are some procedures in the world that not suited for the operational characteristics of the kln these procedures are not included in the data base and therefore the points that make up these procedures would have to be entered it is good preflight practice ensure that the kln tains anticipated procedures for the and star procedures are stored with the airport for which sid and star procedures are accessed through the apt if there are both and stars for given then there will be two apt one to select sid and the other to select this is indicated by it is also possible to have only sid or only star in which case there is only one apt approaches and and sid and star procedures are defined in three the parts are the sid or star name transition and runway specific component rw the apt pages lead you through the selection selecting sid use the following procedure to select some steps may not be necessary depending on the procedure that you wish to for this the porte nine departure from san francisco international will be select on one of the airport pages if you are operating from an active flight plan you can use the act page for by scanning through the active flight plan section not already rotate the right inner knob until the apt page appears

flight then the kln will ask to add this point to the active flight gives the actions required to fly this selecting star the steps required to select star are very similar to those required to select the only difference is the order of the steps to define the star and where the star is loaded into the flight the steps required to define acton four arrival with the wink tion serve as an example of how to select this star is to the worth international airport select dfw on one of the airport pages if you are operating from an active flight plan you can use the act page for dfw by scanning

departure loaded into the flight plan in section will be remember that was selected meaning that the procedure is applicable to both runways and the fellows transition was also this procedure is one of the more difficult that you are likely to come most procedures are not this but this sid serves as good example for what steps to take when you encounter difficult fly this procedure use the following steps and refer to the chart this sid the sid as described in section procedure states and proceed via sfo the dme fix at or above to accomplish this of the put the kln into the obs mode

procedures the required to fly acton four arrival to worth international will be shown in this this procedure is considerably simpler than the sid example shown in section for this example assume that the aircraft departs from el texas and files for the acton four arrival with the wink use the lowing steps to fly this procedure with the kln and refer to the chart for this star the star into the flight plan as described in section star is very simple and the kln will automatically guide the aircraft along the proper route until the qn before reaching qn examine this procedure and notice that there are two different routes depending on what type of craft is flying the turbojets fly to creek intersection while fly to the data base in the kln has the sequence of points for the turbojet procedure not the sequence for is extremely rare to have different path over the ground turbojets and but be sure to cross check with your paper and and if the aircraft you are flying in is then fly

was originally conceived and implemented by the united states department of defense the system able to all civilian users free of gps provides extremely precise and time satellites are not as is the case with weather and television that each satellite is not above fixed spot on the earth all the but rather is continuously moving across the in each satellite completely orbits the earth two times per department of defense imposes an intentional accuracy of the gps this degradation is known as selective availability when sa is only military users have access to full gps for civilian position accuracy is degraded to no worse than at the time of this selective availability is on therefore accuracy is ly of the position determining the technique used to determine position is fundamentally very the complicated part is accounting for and correcting all the possible errors in the gps receiver is able to determine the time it takes radio to travel from the satellite to the gps since this radio signal travels at the speed of light statute miles per the time delay can very easily be used to determine the distance from given if measurements are taken from four satellites three satellites and an input from an aircraft the receiver can identify its position very appendix appendix for the gps receiver might determine that it is miles from satellite miles from satellite and miles from satellite at the same the aircraft altimeter might be indicating an altitude of feet there is only one point in space that satisfies these four data signals two of the primary types of signals that the gps satellites broadcast are almanac and ephemeris these signals enable the gps receiver to quickly lock on to the satellites in the receiver would have to look for each of the satellites to determine which ones could be data is very crude data which describes the orbital position of the each of the satellites transmits the almanac data for all so gps receiver has only to listen to one satellite in order to know which satellites are the at that particular almanac data is good for about six so when you turn the receiver then back on month it will know what satellites to look data is very precise data which each satellite transmits tell the gps receiver exactly where it is and what its orbital will be for about the next four each satellite transmits its own unique ephemeris appendix not to gps system the gps system is composed of three the the control and the user space segment consists of the star satellites which orbit the earth at an altitude of nautical the satellite orbits are very precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the gps system hours every there are almost always more than six satellites in view from anywhere on control segment consists of network of and control the master control station is located in colorado all satellite data which is collected by the other ground stations is assimilated and analyzed at colorado based on these ephemeris updates as tem clock are sent to the satellites through radio transmitters at the ground these ground stations are located at kwajalein of hawaii in the central pacific diego garcia the indian and ascension the south atlantic an owner of gps you can now claim to be member of the gps user gps has many users and and more are being dreamed up all the not only are aircraft using gps so are military systems and and personal automobiles and transport trucks use intelligent transportation or to find their and track their some biologists attach gps receivers to animals to monitor their movement and migration geologists even use gps to track the movement of ers and to analyze plate tectonics of the an exciting new technology as we move into the autonomous integrity monitoring is function that every gps receiver must continuously perform to assure an accurate one characteristic of the gps space and control segments is that they instantly fix satellite if it sending misleading positioning for this gps receiver rely on the gps satellites to tell it when there is the words indicate that the gps kln appendix appendix on can detect an inaccuracy in the gps it does this by using distance measurements from as many satellites as possible to check the consistency of the position is called an position there are not enough satellites in view to assure the position the kln notifies the five measurements with good geometry positions of the are needed to provide this means that at least five satellites or four satellites and pressure altitude input from the altimeter are required assure aim if this check shows some sistency in the the kln notifies the user that other navigation sources should be used to the sometimes the receiver is unable to assure the position to enough accuracy for the phase of due to the location of the satellites at that availability is very seldom difficulty when in the en route terminal phases of the allowable limits are much tighter when approach is performed with kln for this the kln other page allows the pilot to enter time and and the gps receiver will predict if aim will be available to shoot the see section for more information about the aim prediction receiver the kln and kln use an honeywell gps receiver known as the gps it was dubbed this way because it is cal in size to an everyday credit and its faster acquisition time than previous the gps receiver has eight parallel which means each channel can continuously track for continuous tracking of up to eight gps the parallel receiver design has several

report is intended for those who require an understanding of the brief overview of how the project research and analysis were and list of the significant findings and readers and front line managers who may need or want more details of the research and and complete listing of findings and recommendations can refer to the full report that the noncompliance problem approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for aviation accounting annually for approximately percent of all flight safety foundation study of years of runway excursions determined that percent could have been avoided with decision to go in other percent of all accidents could potentially be prevented by going it is generally felt that an unstable approach is the primary cause of landing within this just over half of the landing excur followed fully stable in these the flight became unstable only during critical industry policy designed to help prevent such accidents is the and the collective industry performance of complying with policies is extremely poor approximately percent of unstable approaches result in policy why is critical policy designed to prevent the most common type of accident ignored by flight and why is that policy not being managed effectively by improving the compliance rate holds tremendous potential in re approach and landing accidents the itself is not without there is an increased risk in loss of control events during compared to exposure with all other phases of it follows that we should only go around when the risk associated with an unstable approach is greater than the risk associated with what is that and how do we minimize exposure to only those that are really the flight safety foun making and execution project was launched to research and answer the question are we so poor at complying with established it was also intended to improve our understanding of the risks associated with executing and to make com to improve compliance and mitigate risks with the maneuver the full report includes complete find strategies and recommendations for industry corrective and future work as it is meant as source for the development of operator refer products such as guidelines and research and analysis many alas have been investigated thoroughly over and much is known about contributing what is is an understanding of the psychology of pli research and analysis of decision making have been conducted primarily from the psychosocial science perspective to gain an understanding of the psychological drivers of and to identify corrective steps that can be based on this is the first industry of its type for this specific the presage group conducted the research and based on its situational model of nine distinct or from two global studies via one survey analyzed the psychology of noncompliance by flight and the other examined the psychology of actions in handling company detailed analysis can be found in the full for the execution an accident and incident review was conducted that included selection of published accident and serious incident re about events involving transport category aircraft between and total of events were in the safety of the was central to the accident or incident in th the aftermath of the was the main purpose of the the events involved jets twin turboprops and jets the safety aspects and overall level of risk of each event were analyzed and characterized by review each event was assigned to one of three categories according to the degree of risk presented by the high risk moderate risk and in the two six safety issues were identified with respect to the ia and conduct of each most of the bearing events were associated with single but five events were associated with two each event also was assigned one of three loss of controlled flight into terrain or midair significant findings an effective policy has three main it is well thought out and clearly written to balance the needs of safety and company management handles the policy and company front line aware is such that the policy is carried out research revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the operator and employee significant findings the collective industry norm is to accept the pli of despite empirical data that indicate this is the most common contributor to the industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable approaches as the sole means to reduce even though empirical data show that unstable approaches affect less than half of runway overall awareness of ala risks and of the impact those risks have on approach and landing safety is management is generally disengaged from noncompliance and has low awareness of the impact it has on perception of risk is pilots do not see current policy criteria as realistic for the operational effective decision making in flight deck com cation is although considered normal flight eu are as reported by flight one in has potentially hazardous such as an aircraft for there are variable techniques and depending on the point during the approach when the around procedures and training do not adequately address many of these pilot experience in the aircraft type affects including complex controller radio can affect recommendations it is evident that the state of noncompliance has been steady for many years and will remain steady unless changes are first and the industry must improve its awareness of the shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is the cultural shift will be easier if the industry shifts as opposed to individual attacking the issue on their as several are already as stated three key attributes of an effective policy the policy makes operational sense to both the employees who execute it and those who manage the policy is managed effectively to level that satisfies company and the employees who should follow the policy are very aware of that policy and the environment in which it is as the following recommendations touch upon these key more detailed recommendations can be found in the full strategic recommendations for decision making include the ensure the policy makes sense update the stable approach definition and stable ap height to maximize their relevance among flight and their manageability among separate the stable approach definition and criteria from criteria to improve aware that these are two distinct aspects of and that decision making is viable beyond the defined approach this separation does not imply that these two distinct areas cannot meet at points throughout the approach and it is intended for developers of standard operating pro dures and communication procedures to break the psychological attachment of these two manage the policy operators set specific compliance rate targets performance and establish initiatives to achieve amend industry and regulatory audit programs to include standards and recommended practices that address noncompliance increase situational increase awareness of and risks associated with continuing to land when and the significant impact that noncompliance has on alas operator flight industry and pilot enhance situational awareness aware to heighten flight awareness throughout the approach and landing policy and procedural communication minimizing the subjectivity of decision making for the decision maker the pilot flying or to mitigate those components of situ awareness that compromise the risk assessment and each recommendation helps improve the psychological riv that affect good decision and it is this ec that the recommendations were specifically designed to although all strategic recommendations are important and should be implemented as part of holistic few are worth if an operator has the means to install automated stable approach and land alerting it should be these systems address many of the psychological issues associated with noncompliance and could be the single most effective way to improve management must be more involved in managing the an area where management has been very much key steps to be taken by management are to set compliance rate targets consistent with safety management system prin and to investigate and follow up on each approach that continues to an unstable flight crew situational awareness needs to be improved primarily through better communication throughout the approach and which can be achieved largely through active communication techniques as part of standard strategic execution ensure that training and awareness pri reflect different execution risk review procedures and men to maximize their clarity and ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitoring during landing and as with any significant program and effects should be closely monitored by pri audit programs such as flight data analysis line operations safety audits or international air trans association operational safety audits action taken in light of the findings and it is appar that revisions are required to flight safety elements of stabilized and safe landing guidelines analysis indicates there are facets of that guidance that are not optimal for effective decision making and that may encourage for approaches that may be of very low when this report was being the analysis for such revisions had already taken but the project review committee recommended an operational trial before changes in the guidelines are formally appendices and for flight safety foun stabilized approach and for industry and safe landing for industry project conclusion the problem of policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the greatest threat to flight safety and the po impact of improvement in compliance is no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go the industry must improve its awareness of the to accomplish shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is attain the cultural shift will be much easier if the in shifts as opposed to individual companies taking individual several companies already have chosen to go it alone on this the project accomplished the goals of the document that outlined the terms of flight safety safety initiative understand the noncompliance by flight and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight and to consider the safety risk with and ensure that the transfer of risk is there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of the not all envisioned products have been and this is noted in the report as work yet to be done by flight safety background presentation in flight safety international advisory committee was briefed about concerns that often were not being conducted when an unstable approach occurred below the stable approach height the ensuing discussion concluded in agreement that the issue should be studied the eu advisory committee began its own discussion related to the lack of unstable approach policy the risk of the maneuver and what effect air traffic services providers could have on the these discussions led the foundation to look more deeply into the empirical data supporting such failure to conduct is the number one risk factor in approach and landing accidents and the number one cause

year in simply potentially about half of all accidents could be prevented with decision to go no other single de can have such an impact on the overall aviation accident although all of these studies are somewhat the consistencies from study to study indicate the problem is real and is of the magnitude the studies around decision can yield great but what about the risks associated with the maneuver there is no shortage of informative studies that have ana what occurred during alas and what factors contrib to the no known study has examined flight crew decision making from psychological

focusing on one specific aspect of the the focused on decision and the focused on the performance of the decision making flight crew methodology and information collection the presage group was commissioned by flight safety foun to conduct research and analysis on the psychology of factors contributing to intentional the basis for much of the following comes from two studies conducted by presage one that analyzed the psychology of flight crew decision making during unstable and another that analyzed the psychology of company management decision making pertaining to addressing noncompliance with com safety policies jamieson and why are policies the ology of de making during unstable jamieson and why are policies the view from the airline although the issue extends beyond unstable the studies were conducted on this phase of flight as data were readily attainable from flight psychological survey was developed that used unique questioning and experimental methodologies to understand the causation of compliant versus noncompliant flight crew decision these techniques included assess experiences using series of questions designed to explore the psychological precursors of risk assessment and decision second survey was designed to assess the beliefs and experiences of airline ag and safety and operational personnel regarding unstable approaches and how they are managed at their host to fully understand the systemic roots and dynamics of noncompliance with unstable approach policies across the the results of the managers study were compared with those of the parallel flight crew flight crew event recall study segmentation in this segment of the we asked pilots to recall recent specific instances of unstable at or below sah we asked for the last instance they had this special task elicited detailed descriptions of their experiences during the minutes leading up to and including decision on whether to call for these experiences include

accordance with the recommendations made by members of the and and other expert advisory team the pilots were divided into those who only experienced continuing to land with an unstable approach those who only experienced those who had experienced both and unstable approach pilots in this group were randomly as to one of two groups to recall scenario in which they had flown an unstable approach but did not call for or to recall this random experimental assignment allowed us to identify objective and psychological situational factors associated with noncompliance with policies re decision pilots

experiment was included in this and we report some findings but the details are too mer to fully describe this experiment was designed to uncover the environmental and physical instability param that influence perceptions of the risks inherent in flying unstable and to examine when their attention to these parameters affects their judgments about when to call for in this pilots were pre with hypothetical flight scenario in which they were randomly assigned to receive variations in the severity of the risk associated with wind runway braking action and runway they were then asked at what degree of on five different flight those variations would cause them to call for pilots were instructed to report on their likelihood of calling for based on their own personal risk not those of their companies or of the on this set of five flight and to do so at different this allowed us to infer where on the flight path different risk factors become personally salient and important as drivers of judgments to go and how these factors might the objective was to determine whether there was basic alignment between about when there is need to call for and general policies about when these instabilities necessitate such in case of evidence of any gaps between these our goal was to use these data to guide realistic recommendations about changes in policy that might bring them into alignment while ensuring that safety would not be to the extent that pilots do not see current policies as constituting set of legitimately unsafe they are likely to ignore such standard procedures and engage in potentially pli flight this was an experimentally based attempt to explore pilot perceptions of what should constitute the conditions to go in their experienced and to begin to develop view about whether such beliefs could be or should be incorporated into policy guidance and sops in way that would help ensure safe pilot respondent sampling respondents to this survey were solicited through direct communication with safety personnel at various pilot and and airlines as well as through various social media the goal was to invite and administer the online survey to as many pilots

unstable approach criteria and as well as those responsible for quality control of flight op series of questions regarding their views of the safety procedures and organizational cultures with which unstable approaches and occur in their own airline we asked such managers about the rates of compliance with unstable approach policies that they believed their airlines as well as the compliance rates experienced by the commercial industry as beyond this basic we asked whether they were satisfied with their performance on li with their unstable policies and and whether they thought them about their perceptions of the clarity and appropriateness of these policies and about their beliefs that they had the support support and organizational to manage their and about their overall assessment

irrespective of whether their role included policy development or the considerable efforts that we made in our outreach and engagement strategy for the survey garnered unique visits to the survey we consider this number of hits to be very indicating that the engagement strategy drove meaningful number of airline managers to the of those only completed the response rate low in both absolute and relative to the rate of participation among pilots who were asked to complete much longer and more demanding this low response rate we the first evidence pointing toward disengagement with the topic of unstable policy and procedures among airline flight operations personnel at the managerial this is especially true when we consider that the original criterion for inclusion in our final analysis stipulated that respondents must be in position to develop and influence unstable policies and procedures at their airlines by virtue of their authority to recommend or make based on this inclusion criterion and an analysis of reported roles and we achieved sample of only qualified spon to increase the sample size for we widened the sample frame to include those respondents responsible for quality control of flight operations at their even if they did not have policy development thorough comparison of the latter group with the original target revealed no systematic differences in their survey justifying their inclusion in the final the reports the results from managers per of all survey respondents and percent of survey site this low response rate essen disallowed us from analyzing data for experimental task of determining personal around thresholds for unstable approach risk among similar to the threshold in light of the low response caveat must be issued for all other results that we report that is because the normative response to the survey invitation among managers worldwide was to choose not to we must question whether this was valid and reliable sample of that the although based on this small are highly suggestive of trends in perspectives on unstable policies and while we are unsure if the sample in our intuition tells us that any sample if would tend toward having surveyed managers who are more aware and concerned about the issue than those who are less if this is these results may more likely the degree of awareness and concern about unstable around

dispositional pilot tendencies and preferences associated with flying unstable approaches of present in the aviation and we will also point out in the data how such pilot sposi factors may additionally contribute to noncompliance with it is our belief that the best way to present the findings is to describe how noncompliant behavior is function of process influenced by the aircraft and environmental factors that shape their situational awareness competencies in encoding and inter the cues they receive about these aircraft and their personal perceptions of risk and risk tolerance that and their appetite for appropriate col conversation about risk during the approach as an input to decision it is from both the responses within each of these four classes of as well as the interactions between the two that complete scrip psychological profile for noncompliance pilot situational awareness profile situational awareness of his or her in all its is the psychological prerequisite for pilot to judge risk and then to make decision to maintain compliance and safety in light of that this study used the situational awareness model for measuring and interpreting the psychological and social factors that col make up situational recall that within this situational awareness comprises nine distinct but interconnected and seamless aspects of much of our discussion will be framed around how each of these aspects influences singly and in concert with one to remain compliant rather than note in passing that the presage model classifies with an average percent accuracy whether pilots are describing an unstable approach and landing or percent for unstable approaches and percent for based only on its psychosocial measurements and excluding any knowledge of the objective factors present in the unstable approach scenarios this means that our assessment of the experience of aware as we have measured does good job of predicting behavior far beyond percent chance level of the results of this study as that on all nine situational awareness unstable approach pilots were significantly less aware than pilots in the moments leading up to and including their around decision making that they were less aware of their emotional responses to less able to anticipate more overconfident in their ability to compensate for the and in less agreement with company in other the unstable pilots scored much lower than did the pilots on every facet of situational awareness seven of these nine differ held up statistically to the more rigorous analysis that compared just the experimentally assigned and un approach pilots with one and eight of the nine differences between the experimentally assigned and unstable approach pilots were even more pronounced when comparing the and it is meaningful to does this awareness shape perception of put situational awareness competencies directly affect his or her perceptions and assessment of the lower the degree of threat that pilots associate with instability and environmental factors the perception of which is directly informed by their situ awareness the lower the significance that pilots will place on the contributing factors and the less risky they will perceive the situation to table shows this with unstable pilots reporting much lower assess of the riskiness and unmanageability of their bili than the spreading activation effect of situational awareness competencies we have asserted that the nature of the facets of situational awareness means that decline in one facet will produce rapid deleterious effect on the this becomes clear when we consider the data relevant to this activation of situational awareness for this effect is evident among the unstable approach pilot whose lower scores on their gut feel for threats as well as on actually seeing the leave them vulnerable to minimizing both their assessment of the potential threat of aircraft instability and their ability to see the threat of instability as risk to be managed the natural outcome is that more unstable approach pilots are unstable at sah corollary of these lower aware scores is that unstable approach pilots also score lower in their ability to leverage crew relationships to maximize compliance and table shows that unstable approach pilots are more likely to minimize efforts to consider discuss with their members both instability factors path aircraft ref sink rate and land and environmental factors contaminated runway and occupied it is the culminating effect of the aforementioned reduced awareness competencies that leaves the unstable approach pilots vulnerable to adopting mental model that minimizes the risk of instability and reduces their attention to as the results for the instruments and and the indicate functional and hierarchical in table unstable approach pilots are more tolerant of deviations from operational limits and procedures and less compliant with requirements that they perform all checklists and standard as these pilots commit to continuing with an unstable they minimize what their professional experience could offer in executing what the sop states table note on or critical in other when an unstable approach pilot is not tuned into salient from his or her experience he increases the risk profile of the operation and denies himself the opportunity to correctly adjust or compensate for the operational threat table to or compensatory the finding that unstable approach pilots more often than pilots report being unstable at sah confirms this missed opportunity to remain compliant in concert with the former pattern is the finding that unstable approach pilots were more comfortable operating on the margins of the safety envelope in table note the lower scores on the or empirical which translates to greater tolerance for risk that is seen to be in table note the assessment of the instability as if pilot is paying less attention to his situational awareness he would likely also shut himself off from avail such as by using interpersonal relationships to protect operational safety and remain compliant table note each other or relational there are number of significant findings at the level of this construct that tell meaningful most notable among these is that unstable approach pilots are relatively more likely than pilots to feel crew to to perceive lack of crew support for possible to feel discomfort in being challenged and in challenging and to feel inhibited about calling for because of the authority structure in the pilots are about four times more likely than unstable approach pilots percent to report recalling that an individual was prompting the crew to initiate ref is reference landing speed the evidence is clear that rather than leveraging the crew relationships as tool for safe decision crew expectations and communication had even compounding this risk profile are the findings that unstable approach pilots score lower on support for and that fewer than percent of unstable pilots believed they would be reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to land at the same maintaining that their criteria for when to execute are not realistic in the for the unstable approach there is less to company and an incentive structure that or is at least not seen to unstable approaches that are continued to these results describe situation that creates internal conflict for the unstable approach at least in when they express regret for their decision to continue an unstable approach to landing compared with unstable approach pilots rated their flight outcomes less believed less often that they had made the right believed much more strongly than pilots that they should not have made the decisions they did agreed more strongly that they had engaged in needless interpretation of results the results appear to imply conflicting message from the unstable approach pilot on one unstable ap pilots regret their decisions to continue an unstable approach and knowing that they have taken and at the same they believe that the criteria for are realistic the latter may in rationalization of their noncompliant and one that they carry forward into the next such unstable approach at the moment of the potential for noncompliant behavior based on these beliefs is very while the chance seems remote that pilots may anticipate regret for not calling for and may have that anticipation inhibit their tendency to continue the unstable consider the psychosocial factors affecting unstable ap pilots at the time they need to make an appropriate decision on whether to go they have lowered sense of situational awareness across most which has led them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their assessment of their process re little help from protective crew norms and and there is no real disincentive to fly unstable the expected company response to that these are the ingredients of recipe for the of to contaminate this component of aviation safety this term refers to the development of mode of which is passively support tolerated approved by its owners and in some regula once entrenched within given this new power and authority can considerably influence as evidenced in the challenger and columbia space shuttle tragedies supportive evidence from the results of this study indicates that in their acceptance of the noncom unstable approach pilots have surrendered level of situational awareness competency that directly impacts accurate risk assessment and full compliance with sops as in new roles and incentives have come to displace some of the influence that situational awareness should have in proximity to risk assessment and decision pilot thresholds for going around another area for discussion is the second experimental part of the which asked pilots to describe their risk toler thresholds for various given set of flight and environmental we found that braking action had particularly large impact on pi perception of the degrees of instability that warrant call for on the thresholds for calling for varied as function of both height agl and the instability parameter they were considering as reason for going for several of these instability fac the perceived threshold occurred well below ft agl to in pilots said that they should be on profile

warranted to fully explain the he of broad noncompliance with policies and the inherent risks associated with the percent of unstable approaches that continue unstable can only be indirectly inferred from the present based on pilot this study mainly assessed the logi characteristics and in situ of pilots who choose to continue unstable approaches to landing versus those who make decisions to go the study does not segregate the various unstable approach scenarios into classes of presenting high or low objective while it is understood that not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent the percent of unstable approaches that are flown to completion include the ap and these can result in in the absence of definition of the objective level of risk associated with given pilots

this determination flows directly from his level and type of situational awareness and the mental models of risk he constructs based on that to the extent that pilot has lowered situational awareness whether caused by acute aspects of the situation such as high workload or chronic aspects of the cultural environment such as lessened acceptance of the policy guidance or generally few challenges to cockpit command he will be less sensitive to relevant situational awareness cues and therefore be more likely to continue an unstable approach irrespective of the inherent objective risks associated

insufficient to cover all as tony an psychologist and author of several books on human has guidance is ef when it is thought out and written explained commonly understood and voluntarily complied too many rules lead to cynicism and because not all situations can be rules cannot be developed to cover all possible in these the human ability to adapt to changing situations is just as important as the implementation of effective policies and need to reach point where two types of professional discipline become kern first is the organizational discipline to keep the rules to an absolute minimum and enforce the rules across the the second is the personal discipline to comply company too he policies and procedures conflict with cultural and when that who studies noncompliance knows that culture will nearly always trump at least in the long not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent and based on the different objective environments from approach to there can be conflict between these and the singular prescriptive company as in by the disagreement with company policy once pilot is outside the prescriptive box of policy and has made the decision to continue the he is left to his individual risk assessment whatever that may to determine his personal risk thresh without robust prescriptive policies that allow for some open analysis of risk and decision making can offer solution to these cases in which the objective and stated policies do not align for if policy says that flight crew must go around in all cases if the aircraft has not touched down within seven seconds of crossing the the pilots likely would view the importance of that policy dif depending on the conditions of the they would likely be more in agreement with the policy for an approach to shorter runway that was contaminated and had slight tail wind than for an approach to dry runway with slight head if the policy is written to allow some from the under some guiding pilots will agree with the policy more in this example of the short contaminated the briefing should include statement that there would be no modification of the whereas in the case of the long the briefing may include an allowance to increase that frame to it is important to em that these allowances should follow guided process laid out by the and that the policies remain mi in this guiding principles may be that all members agree in advance of the and that the landing distance available exceeds the landing distance required by predetermined allowing some guided decision pilots will be more likely to trust and voluntarily comply with written in part because those policies will address the highly variable environments in which pilots work and also because the pilots will recognize that their expertise and knowledge are being used in the an increased agree on policy leads to increased and to the normalization of stable approach and decision points it is also worth discussing the relationship between the stable approach the sah safe landing guidelines and decision as the decision to go around remains possible up until the point of deploy and policies usually indicate that should be initiated any time an aircraft becomes unstable below the then it follows that the decision point to go around defines the beginning of zone in which is mandatory if the approach is thrust reverser deployment defines the end of that most sop channel flight crews to specific decision points to determine if they are in state in which it is safe to continue the these points are before deploy these sop callout points are usually linked with leaving no formal stable for an extended period of time when is active calls selection of calls that are mandatory for all varying objective force communication between or conditional on the other are only communicated if stimulated by the weakness in the passive call process is if call is not it could be for reasons other than the required objective condition being for if member did not see the call would not be in member might choose not to make call for varying such as subjective interpretation of the condition or fear of the cockpit authority active calls are always as they force their absence indicates another such as pilot many responsive by the pilot flying at sah or minimum approach height suggest what will what they are going to do for example suggestive calls like to influence the decision to land and close the window for the decision to go even though may be required if the flight becomes unstable very late in the approach or repeated and escalated calls allow condition to remain alive in the conscious mind of the on the other single callout for example at sah raises situational awareness about the condition at that as situational awareness is it can change improving or and that are designed to continue as long as the condition exists help to maintain awareness of that escalation of the calls can heighten take the example of from enhanced ground proximity warning systems and other terrain awareness and warning systems the system alerts the flight crew to pending condition and continues with until the condition is no longer the same effect can be com in unstable approach by both members and automated as the onset of approach instabilities can occur at any even late in the landing phase keys to safe the window for decision that the deci is not made at defined point at the the decision points for are separate and distinct from the stable approach and as procedure designers can separate the two to maximize decision in reviewing the fsf alar task force elements of stabilized safety foundation alar task we discover somewhat conflicting mes it states that approaches in instrument meteorological conditions must be stabilized before reaching ft visual meteorological conditions they must be stabilized before ft agl in precision and visual approaches on the other the document indicates that descent below ft is acceptable in maneuver for circling and specifies that should be level on final when the aircraft reaches ft above airport in other on precision guided the documented guidance is that the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet agl in and on circling guided the aircraft must be stable on final no later than feet it is not difficult for pilot to conclude if it is acceptable and safe to fly off final approach profile until ft agl on then it is also safe to fly an approach to ft off although that by objective objective is that which does not require an individual to interpret information based on his or her ex or it is usually factual objective feedback in the cockpit minimizes the need for interpretation and can lead to more consistent and faster decision stating fact instead of interpreting making judgment or forming an opinion helps mini the effect of steep authority gradient in the such as may exist when first officer is paired with an example of objective feedback is that by an automated system such as in this there is little subjective analysis done by the pilot when re to automated and the response can be quick and this in why an automated energy approach monitoring and alerting can be very effective in improving another example of the use of objective feedback is the use of radio altimeter automatic rather than interpreting radio altimeter readout readouts can fluctuate due to terrain and must be observed and on the other are only in the absence of an automated energy management after pilots cross the they usually subjectively or how much runway has passed or how much from they decide whether to conduct if the pilot monitoring times the threshold crossing and then makes procedural call at the point where touchdown should occur or should this call constitutes objective feedback to the pilot flying and makes clear that some either touchdown or should occur should have driven by policy and minimizing subjectivity in pro is an objective that procedural designers should make every effort to management decision making overview of results in table we present data for of their awareness if their specific estimates both the and their own rates of compliance with unstable when asked whether they knew what the compliance rate only percent of managers said that they of those who claimed fewer were willing to estimate managers percent of the offered an estimated which averaged percent compliance times the true and was highly variable percent to standard only one in seven managers reported rate that was considered percent of the actual percent the perception of rates may not be the central concern of managers working to police their own noncompliance with unstable but this general lack of awareness and accuracy in estimating the true even among those claiming cannot be when asked whether they knew what their own compliance rate percent of managers said that they although only percent offered an estimate of that majority of managers are largely unaware of unstable compliance and noncompliance even within their own of the managers who offered the mean rate was percent again with large range to and standard de these managers are estimating li rates at their companies that on more than percent above the industry average as they perceive it if their estimates were they would indicate that the companies were outperforming the indus as whole by more than tenfold percent what is most striking is the tremendous degree of variability in the revealing that there is very little common basis of even among those claiming knowledge of the rates at their own in our it is highly unlikely that this is an objective for perceptions to have truly tracked with these data would mean that companies are ex the full range of compliance from zero to it is hard to imagine that this is the and hard to imagine how this could result in an average that hovers at percent year after table manager of awareness

companies had flight data of the managers at those reported on their rate of compliance as indicated by their these managers are not the same who reported on their flight operations compliance rates in answer to the prior one in eight managers reported compliance rates broadly in line with the industry average less than at the opposite end of the percent re rates above the mean rate was again with wide range and variability to with standard deviation of that such spread of compliance rates is reported by this sample is we believe it reflects not only general lack of awareness among managers of the rates of compliance with their own policies strongly indicated by the incidence of but perhaps also specific errors within their although objective data are this assertion can only be by again assuming that compliance rates exceeding percent are rare in the we cannot rule this out because although we have access to we lack objective verification of company compliance if the rates are it suggests that our sample is drawn from an unusually compliant subsample of in that the lack of awareness effects across the manager study suggests that awareness could be less than we begin with some overall observations about the data in table on each of the three the norma response is to not and only minority of ag claim to or rate of as managers and compliance rates for their own companies more frequently than they do for the industry as probably because they are less familiar with their perception of the compliance is out of line with six times greater than the actual percent rate of managers tell us as an aggregate sample that they believe their companies are outperforming the rate of compliance by to on this is the equivalent of compliance rate at least times greater than the as if we assume that these com have more realistic unstable policy compliance rate below percent rate span still up to three times better than the current industry this would mean that only about one in seven managers to in the survey reported an accurate rate for their own whether their reporting was based on personal estimate or on their fda if we give them more and allow that their companies actually achieved rates upward of then high accuracy of rates of report is still shared by fewer than of the seven in simply do not know their own or if they do they their compliance rates by more than these kinds of perceptual errors are likely to produce overconfidence and complacency about unstable policy manager situational awareness profile manager perceptual measures of situational awareness managers completed questions to assess their beliefs and behaviors concerning their rates and unstable the results are in table the responses were subjected to an empirical factor analysis to determine how they merged in minds and to provide simpler summary categories for presentation and three of the four factors to emerge had more than one associated one factor was assessment of whether the respondent debriefed flight crew who had violated the com unstable factor theme was the perceived support that the spon received from their companies in understanding and managing the six questions this factor com were averaged and called factor comprised questions assessing the degree to which managers thought that their unstable policies and procedures and their associated operational definitions were clear and responses to five questions were averaged to create an index of factor was an expression of ag concerns about and sense of urgency surrounding their it was formulated by averaging responses to the five questions shown in table and named in addition to the four we present overall measures recorded by managers of their satisfaction and the per effectiveness their policies and as they relate to unstable the first thing to notice in table about these manager per is the absolute levels of the means on the underlying scale did not offer but

weaker than the index score of overall satisfaction with compliance rates associated with their flight while slightly was still on the positive side of the in concert with this pattern perhaps because of these perceptions and judgments man slightly disagreed overall that there was cause for concern or need for action to improve their taken these absolute scores indicate that ag are not completely happy with their for on policy and but their concerns are not great to stimulate greater aware or as an regression analysis of the drivers of the and scores revealed that overall effectiveness is perceived in proportion to scores on the perceived effectiveness and to lesser the lack of urgency and concern is expressed by scores on the perceived threat in complementary over satisfaction was driven first by lower perceived threat scores and secondarily by higher perceptions reflected in the perceived effectiveness these differential patterns were although the overall measures of satisfaction and effectiveness were on narrowly agreed that they all flight crews who have broken our policies on operational procedures for taken at its per disagree that all flight crews are high absolute number of managers who admit to less than complete debriefing while this may seem like high the fact that the statement was phrased as as opposed to company may account for the to examine the relationships between positive perceptions of organizational compliance fac and low concern with their we studied responses from only those managers who had reported on their compliance rates that of all those claiming knowledge of this we divided them into managers whose reports were generally close to the industry average of accept anyone who reported rate of less than percent into group we labeled reporting what looked like reasonably accurate compared with the industry base all other managers reported compliance rates from to percent and were placed in comparison group labeled reporting compliance rate not likely to be the results show that stating an rate of li is at significant statistical with higher scores on two of the five questions on the second factor of per the effectiveness index as and the single measure of effectiveness effective it is also correlated with lower scores on the perceived threat index and four of its five component while this pattern may seem obvious in it makes the point independent of the level of support perceived for ag rates were no differences on the perceived support the perception of the policies as effective and the threat as low may flow from basic lack of realistic knowledge or appraisal of the compliance if this causal effect is true that posi perceptions lead to low perceived threat then what is clearly indicated by these data is the need for raising about the industry norm of massive and dissemination of the own data identifying their internal rates of unstable around policy compliance and segmentation analysis to determine whether the sample included types of ag whose views of their compliance rate and performance were consistent with each other and also different from other identified we conducted traditional cluster analysis on this sample of managers agglomerative cluster based on euclidean due to the small sample we generated just two groups to and based the mathematics of this segmentation on variety of responses given in the this of consisted of the perception questions and the two overall measures of effectiveness and satisfaction all the measures presented in table not the resulting groups consisted of one whose members perceived high risk in their compliance rates risk and second group whose members had more moderate view risk the percent of ag who perceived high risk differed from the percent of perceivers on almost all measures in the and powerfully in both the statistical sense and the magnitude sense degree of statistical table shows that on of and on all three the high risk perceiver group showed pattern of higher concern and perceived lower satisfaction with their lower perceived policy and compliance presage situational awareness construct results for managers

risk perceiver types tended to see their company compliance rates as slightly perform relative to industry whereas low risk perceiver types reported that their companies were definitely outperforming the industry compliance high risk types were more likely to claim that prior to the they had been aware of the industry rate and of their own company flight rate of those in the high risk perceiver group were more likely to report being in roles in which they had less power to effect more often saying they were able only to offer com added to the fact that members of the high risk perceiver group were three times less likely than those in the low risk perceiver group to say their compliance rates were between and percent suspect number and more than four times as likely to say that their fda showed their rate was between zero and percent number more in line with industry norms picture emerges of group whose members are more realistic and appropriately anxious and concerned about their low rates of but who perhaps have little voice or power within the company to change policy or procedures they see as more likely to be or to offer new definition of what should constitute stable approach they see as overly how did these managers score on the presage indices of situational this situation presents clear instance of via of most policies and procedures surrounding unstable performance rates and their manage as our metrics are likely to show low absolute on scale of to with corresponding to high safety the first column of table which displays these scores for the overall shows this to be the in no case does the absolute score on any of our awareness metrics exceed the midscale of safety awareness is low in all of the awareness areas assessed by our we know in this instance that unstable noncompliance is major problem for the our measures of situational awareness are scored higher when this problem is recognized to be in the ap to scoring shown in table all measures are scored such that higher numbers indicate greater degree of realistic threat awareness and as higher situational awareness on our measures is associated with seeing the cur threat to be real anticipatory and the procedural measures used to compensate for it to be ad adjusting to the managers with higher situational awareness see their current procedures as re and the definitions of instability as too narrow scores on knowing the procedures and knowing the their experience high reliance on peri tells them there is and they feel more anxious and eager to take action against this safety threat gut feeling for because new plan is needed in the face of general lack of appreciation of the threat to compliance in their higher awareness is also associated with perception that their companies have little will to and are generally complacent about the sops in place to manage the threat relational and corporate support for as those with higher awareness also feel less support from and higher level of discomfort in approaching senior management to broach the with this understanding of our scoring methods in we examined the scores of the two groups the managers who reported compliance rate based on their fda that was than versus those who the compliance rate percent or we hypoth sized that more accurate awareness of the low rate of compliance would be associated with heightened sense of perceived threat and the felt need to com all aspects of the situational awareness we that managers who were aware of the actual low rate of compliance with unstable around policies at their airlines would receive higher scores on all nine of our metrics than their colleagues who were even if the magnitude of these scores was still low in absolute terms when compared to the scale in table it can be seen that on seven of our nine metrics of situational the hypothesis that the respondents would report greater situational awareness was supported at level of statistical reliability of percent or that if this experiment were repeated we would observe the same differences in of the only on the and each other were the levels of awareness similar for the two albeit at low absolute in those aware of the low compliance rates at their companies scored at or above the midscale on five of our metrics fec anticipatory and if minimum midscale threshold of situational awareness across majority of our measures was enough to trigger some the individuals in this group were close to reaching such trigger how note that this group constituted just percent of of our sample small minority coming to full aware of the table also shows results derived from cluster analysis on the presage metrics for the two groups those perceiving relatively high risk in their unstable around policies and rates percent of and those not generally perceiving such risks will be recalled these groups were designed for all managers in the irrespective of whether they claimed to or ventured to what their company compliance rate actually according to fda or in this all nine awareness factors are statistically reliably with five means above the midscale for the perception these results are more encouraging in terms of the complement of managers perhaps ready to act in this important area of as about of the sample shows signs of having reached threshold of aware that will trigger activity to manage this issue more safely in the near as demonstration of the effect that improved awareness in one area can have on overall situational we compared the situational awareness scores of all managers with the scores of the group whose members were aware of their internal company compliance rates figure shows the incremental benefit that awareness in one area can have across eight of the nine it is relevant to discuss the approach to monitoring unstable approach flight as many flight data monitoring programs are set to report only when more than one stable approach criterion is and in some to report only low level alert until three or more criteria are we see an indication from those responsible for the design of these programs that there is an acknowledged variability in the risk of unstable more there is an indication of on between the level of concern for low risk unstable approaches and the policy guidance for flight crews on those same which is to execute when one or more criteria are from the spec of the flight why should they be concerned about the risk of this level of unstable approaches if management is not concerned enough to want to be told about them or act on situational awareness of managers who knew company compliance rules feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures additional base score the presage group for flight safety foundation this is consistent with the results of both the pilot and management psychological industry sensing the conversation about reducing the risk of alas often drifts toward how to eliminate unstable even though the discussion begins with focus on rates of compliance with it is clear that there is larger with the existence of unstable despite the fact that the industry has reduced unstable approaches to percent or in an industry with such variable objective one must ask is the lowest attainable unstable approach it makes sense that an industry with almost nonexistent compliance with policies would be concerned about the small number of unstable approaches that if we turn the tables and consider for moment an industry with high rate of policy would there be as much concern about unstable and is the focus on eliminating unstable approaches the right strategy in reducing in flight safety year study of runway conducted in we see that percent of the landing excursions were las as and of percent followed stable approach that became unstable during the landing only percent of the landing excursions followed unstable overruns accounted for the other percent of landing percent of overruns followed stable and percent followed unstable in percent of landing runway excursions followed stable and an number per followed unstable separate analysis by boeing of runway overrun excursions from to found that percent followed stable and drawing from concentrated effort to reduce figure overall manager situational awareness scores feel for threats relying on experience seeing the threats knowing the limits orate support for safety knowing the performance metrics adjusting to threats keeping each other safe knowing the procedures the presage group for flight safety foundation number of unstable approaches that become unstable in the approach phase will address less than half of all landing on the other reliable making operation has the potential to affect most landing ex those occurring after flights that become unstable during the approach or landing strategy to continue improving the stable approach rate in addition to improving the compliance rate is the most com the point of this discussion is to illustrate that the tendency to focus only on eliminating unstable approaches will not address large portion of and that improving the compliance rate holds the greater in an fsf runway safety initiative determined that gap existed in alar tool kit risk reduction which did not address the landing phase the foundation then developed safe landing guidelines keys to safe which are intended to be used by aircraft operators to enhance existing throughout this and through industry confer and it was apparent that these guidelines were not well known or commonly documented in company these findings were not part of the data collection decision making the following are findings drawn from mp denotes pilot and mm denotes management mp finding the unstable approach pilot gut feeling for

toward the single focus of improving the unstable approach rate as the best way to prevent even though empirical data indicate finding safe landing guidelines published by flight safety foundation to address an identified gap in the alar tool kit risk reduction is not well known by operators and not documented in operations strategies for corrective decision making we conclude that there are three categories that can be defined in achieving an effective policy from logi the policy should make sense operationally for most environmental conditions encountered for the people executing the policy and those managing the policy operations and should be acceptable to those externally effected by the application of the policy traffic the policy must be managed effectively by the management this is important not only because of the need to achieve objectives set out by senior management but also because those ut the policy need to see and understand that the policy is being managed management over of the policy is awareness of the policy guidance and the risks associated with not executing the policy must be high for both flight crews and the following is list of recommended making strategies to mitigate dm strategy ensure the policy makes sense update the stable approach definition and sah to maximize their relevance to flight crews and their separate the stable approach definition and criteria from criteria and points to improve awareness that these are two distinct aspects of and that decision making continues beyond the approach this does not imply that they cannot meet at points throughout the approach and it is intended for the sop and communication designers to separate the psychological attachment of these two dm strategy manage the policy operators set specific compliance rate targets for and establish initiatives to achieve authorities amend industry and regulatory audit pro to include standards and recommended practices that address dm strategy increase increase awareness of noncompliance and risks associated with continuing to land when and awareness of the significant impact that pli has on operator flight industry and pilot enhance situational awareness to heighten flight awareness throughout the ap and and landing policy and procedural communication minimize the subjectivity of decision making for the decision maker pf or as per com to mitigate those components of situational awareness that compromise the risk assessment and for by installing stable approach monitoring decision making the following are recommendations for corrective action to mitigate noncompliance and execution each recommendation supports previously identified dm recommendation manufacturers should continue develop of and operators should install stable approach and energy management monitoring and alerting dm recommendation operators should understand their own respective compliance dm recommendation operators should establish internal around compliance rate targets and dm recommendation where flight crew ia and operator management should establish or process in which fda can be used to assist in effectively managing compliance dm recommendation operators and the industry should the stable approach criteria and sah to better align policies with manageable and operational safe see appendix for flight safety new stabilized approach and for industry avoid stable approach criteria and heights that address very that avoid criteria if are not likely to result in or if decision is may transfer risk to maneuver distinguish between profile criteria and energy management criteria and decision point which could have distinct and separate allow for variable objective not all environ create the same risk high tail winds and contaminated runways statistically create the the stable approach although mostly should allow an element of guided decision making that is corroborated between dm recommendation operators should establish and publish safe landing guidelines in operations keys to safe and see appendix revised safe landing for industry dm recommendation operators should develop procedures to be performed during every approach that describes the state of stability and the intention of the decision based on company effective elements of these communications the state of stability is made by the member not responsible for the decision to go around the pm or the first per company this creates shared responsibility for activity in the communication procedures are not passive or conditional call is made at the assigned point during every this forces communication procedures should be objective they should state facts about the this minimizes authority gradients within the communication procedures should be sequential and esca late if the condition is not corrected to within ac calls continue and escalate to defined point at which new directive call is for if an call at ft agl does not result in successful corrective the calls continue every ft until the condition is corrected or critical point is and then directive call is made this maintains continuous situational awareness updating of the similar to warning system active communication should continue well into the ap proach and landing up to the touchdown limit this maintains continuous situational each call should be answered with an ac or call by the decision maker pf or per company the call should not suggest the exclusion of other possible outcomes calling at mini when is an option can have the effect of the window of calling for on the other responding with or assists in keeping decision making dm recommendation operators should apply objective procedures well into the approach and landing including in the touchdown energy management monitoring and alerting systems will minimize the need for dm recommendation operators should create standard descent briefing guidelines that environmental risk instability factors that will result in review of standard decision making in the landing recommendation operators should create standard approach briefing guidelines that update the brief at period just before the approach is dm recommendation operators should understand their spec and flight situational awareness levels and psychological profiles for managing internal dm recommendation operators should provide training to enhance psychosocial awareness and and how they contribute to noncompliant decision dm recommendation operators should ensure no fault around policies are implemented and understood by management and flight dm recommendation operators should ensure that un approach and policies are concise and am including procedures and expectations for recommendation operators should communicate indus rates and internal compliance targets and goals of performance to flight crews and the ag involved in achieving operators also should mmu the potential that improved performance could have on the overall risk dm recommendation state and industry audit such as the iata operational safety audit should establish compliance standards and recommended practices for operators to manage dm recommendation state and industry safety organizations such as those associated with the international civil aviation organization the european aviation safety the faa commercial aviation safety team should review these recommendations and assess inserting them into their safety dm recommendation the aviation community should annually through global aggregate flight compliance rates for both the approach phase and the landing phase of and communicate the findings to the this role is suited to safety organizations such as flight safety dm recommendation the aviation community should develop and implement an initiative that communicates the compliance and the potential that improved performance could have on the ala rate and the overall accident this is role suited to global associations and safety such as flight safety dm recommendation the aviation community should estab new program to provide method for operators to share effective strategies to improve around compliance the information should be incorporated into an existing dm recommendation the industry should establish an fi for the effect of the phenomenon of noncompliance with as labels such as con flight into terrain or loss of control make it easier for the industry to understand and manage label for this phenomenon will do the and in so will help provide foundation for essential effective utility of each recommendation is and each recommendation addresses different finding or as can be seen in appendix holistic approach to implementing these recommendations will have the best overall and as with any significant program and effects should be closely monitored by an appropriate audit program such as line operations safety or execution the accident and incident review included random selection of

pilots must be able to demonstrate that they are able to safely execute that begin from both high energy and low energy states at the point where around decision is ex recommendation pilots must be able to exercise tactical as well as procedural when deciding to go around below stabilized approach gate so that safe execution is not hindered by an inappropriate delay in decision validation of this must be achieved through realistic training ex recommendation training for pilots should include range of operational including from positions other than and the designated sta approach scenarios should involve realistic simulation of typical landing weights and ex recommendation training for both pilots and controllers should incorporate lessons learned from operational ex recommendation

clear understanding of the nature of their to effective ex recommendation if an aircraft has the capability to fly automatic pilot training should be provided and the automation policy should address the ex recommendation pilots must have clear understanding of how the pitch control system works on the aircraft type that they this should be validated by both theoretical testing and use of suitable full flight simulator exercises involving approach and with rather than available and at typical landing ex recommendation review should be conducted to deter whether pilots can lose situational awareness of en conflicting traffic during if other pilots are exchanging radio transmissions with atc in languages other than ex recommendation high priority should be accorded to the provision of

approach procedure design should ensure that straightforward procedures are available and published for each these procedures should be designed in consultation with pilots who are representative of those who will be expected to use the which underlie the map for each run as much as be the low below first stop altitude and an early turn in missed approach procedure should be conditional approach procedures xxx but not later than should be the missed approach fix should be located close to the airport to ensure that an aircraft in trouble can be landed immediately on any runway with any chosen

appropriately flight safety foundation future work establish noncompliance industry label such as or fga to go this is to establish easy as has been accomplished with other such as loc or analyze and at global aggregate unstable approaches and unstable landings to determine the level of associated report global compliance performance develop execution and training guidelines for establish industry noncompliance audit standards and recommended practices with organizations such as the international civil aviation organization and in order to minimize the exposure to unnecessary while ensuring further analysis is required to deter the risk balance point between an unstable approach and the foundation should ensure industry partners pursue this promote the distribution and presentation of this report in and encourage republication in complementing publications and safety project conclusion the problem of policy noncompliance is real and is arguably the largest threat to flight safety the potential impact of improvement in compliance is fi no other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go the first and foremost change required is that the industry must improve its awareness of the to achieve shift in focus and cultural norms is it is believed that significant improvement is the cultural shift will be much easier if the industry shifts as opposed to individual companies making changes on their having said several companies are already attacking this issue the project accomplished the goals set forth in the document announcing the fsf safety understand the noncompliance by flight and noncompliance of quality control measures by flight and to consider the safety risk associated with and ensure that the transfer of risk is understood there are several useable guidelines in the appendix of this not all envisioned products are and this is noted in the report as future work to be done by flight safety

occur if meeting the objective of the next gate is go if the is not by it could continue if being fully stable by ft is if the call at the respective gate indicates an undesired state or that call should be repeated at an appropriate interval until the condition is repeated every stabilized approach and decision guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind flight safety guidelines for conducting stabilized approaches and achieving reliable decision why the the current fsf guidelines were established in november and updated in analysis revealed that facets of that guidance are not optimal for effective deci making and that they may encourage for approaches involving very low the overall goal is to improve decision in revising the stabilized approach four objectives must be the guidelines must make operational sense for both flight crews and management resulting in greater acceptance of the safety must be ensured during the approach by mitigating against the common types of alas energy hard tail runway excursions it must be ensured that the resulting are con ducted for approaches of appropriate and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to ma increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases demands on the flight collective situational awareness must be improved through better flight crews indicated in the project research that current guidelines on when must be executed are not realistic for most operational environments and they described what realistic parameters look like from their the criteria for which stable approach is defined can be grouped into three types of flight path profile and configuration gear and speed and energy management of speed and add to these the variable environmental conditions length and and and there are four groups of parameters to be considered when designing stable approach approach gates we can address all stable approach parameters and ala safety issues at three procedural agl configuration gate from ft to depending on aircraft agl stable agl the stable approach criteria are the same at each gate for ap conducted in both imc and ft agl configuration gate previous guidance required that must be con if the flight was not fully stable in with respect to the physics of safety is the same in both imc and in this differentiation of at feet in imc and at feet in vmc is not the new functional significance of the mark is that it is the last suitable point along the approach to ensure that final landing configuration is selected and verified by the flight the flap and gear deceleration to final approach speed and thrust stabilization should occur before the aircraft reaches the next gate at ft it should be emphasized that initial configuration should occur before reaching the this gate is the last point at which final landing configuration should be selected and the gate is familiar demarcation to flight crews and is often accompanied by an automatically generated note that the gate may vary for air type and gross the operator should determine the appropriate height of the based on aircraft ra characteristics and the the following discussion of aircraft energy management during approach is based on the fsf alar briefing notes safety aircraft deceleration characteristics although deceleration characteristics largely depend on the aircraft type and gross the following typical values can be considered for quick assessment and management of aircraft deceleration deceleration on glide with landing flaps and gear to kt per glide path is typically equivalent to descent gradient of or vertical for final approach groundspeed of aircraft with final approach speed of kt would need to be at maximum speed of kt at the gate to be stable at using the median deceleration rate of kt per nm and descent rate of nm gate does not address any particular ala type but serves to facilitate achieving fully stabilized approach at the next lower gate it is in line with pilot as seen in experimental data from the that aircraft configuration and aircraft energy management are two separate and distinct aspects of stabilized and the aircraft energy stabilization height can be lower than the aircraft configuration although may be considered at this not mandating at this point reduces the overall number of potential by allowing unstable approaches to continue at safe analysis is discussed in improved collective situational awareness at this gate is achieved through procedural active communication between flight agl gate previous guidance required that must be conduct if the flight was not fully stable in the revised guid retains the recommendation that the approach should be fully stable at this the mandate to go around has been although may be considered at this not mandating reduces the overall number of potential by allowing unstable approaches to con while at safe analysis is found in not mandating at this gate also aligns with pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project indicating can still be executed even from lower altitudes when conditions are stable or have only minor deviations outside the stable approach as this makes operational sense to those who execute and manage the there is better likelihood of the gate is suitable point in the approach for flight crew to verify all stable approach it is familiar mar for flight crews and is also often accompanied by an au generated being stable at this point in the approach allows for subsequent developing instabilities to be compared against state of constant energy improved collective situational awareness at this gate is also achieved through procedural active communication between flight ft agl gate this gate is establishing this gate clearly marks the boundary between higher altitudes where stable approach is strongly recommended and the point where continuing an unstable descent reduces the margin of it differentiates between approach stability and these are two distinct flight and from sy they should remain distinct elements in decision it should be understood that the agl value is not intended to be it can be approximated to take ad of aircraft automatic callout for consider an ils minimum set for ft some ac automatic callout systems provide an alert ft above so in such ft agl could be established as the gate value and utilized in the auto callout in the active call descending in an unstable state below the gate should be warning to flight crews that the level of risk is increasing and action is whether the aircraft is unstable at this gate or becomes unstable below analyses indicate that flight crews who continue an unstable descent below ft do not recognize the need for increased concern or the need for the awareness of the increased need for action can be improved by heightening the definition of the from being in an unstable condition to being in condition to go this can prompt the flight crew to make the correct decision to go martin smith of the group psychological tipping point is the moment of maximum situational is when the flight crew is primed to pull the trigger on the the subtle change to to go is such in other the to go is permission to mis to drawing comparison to another industry the pilot not flying is now known as the pm change that was intended to influence the mindset of the pm and also to alter his behavior in recognition of the importance of similar effect can be realized in identifying an unstable flight condition below ft as condition condition that demands to further emphasize the the to win can be viewed as the stable approach zone with the focus on ensuring that the aircraft is fully the area from ft to can be viewed as the primary where the focus shifts from liz the aircraft to going using rejected takeoff below maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action to stop the airplane within the stop as an rejected takeoff below kt is considered to occur in different regime compared with rejected takeoff above through training and there is shift in psychology for pilots operating in the similar shift can be realized through the approach to lowering the execution altitude reduces the overall number of potential by allowing approaches to continue while at alti it makes the stable approach and policies more in line with flight psychological beliefs and more manageable by prevents risk transfer from risk unstable approaches to potentially and limits unnecessary demands on the air traffic if not fully stable at or below this the decision to go around should be made without below ft is not necessarily this determination depends on the degree and type of approach and aircraft type and performance this gate is essentially the beginning of the primary zone from ft to thrust reverser at this the ala is the most common types of low energy alas are landing hard landing and tail if we analyze the most extreme case of low it is one where thrust is at flight speed is ref and the descent rate is fpm double normal rate of federal aviation regulations part the landing the steady gradient climb may not be less than with the engines at the power or thrust that is available eight seconds after initialization of move of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight idle to power design and construction of the engine must enable an increase from the fixed minimum flight idle power from not more than percent of rated takeoff power or thrust available to percent in not less than five the most limiting of these two regulations is the in our extreme case of descending at using linear anal without taking into consideration lessening of the rate of descent as engines and achieving climb the flight will descend ft figure per ft another useful analysis comes from flight safety alar tool kit which says that an aircraft being flown on while on approach with thrust at flight descending at fpm and with ref at minus will experience an altitude loss of approximately ft safety if we more than double the rate of descent to in this the aircraft would ex an altitude loss of approximately feet alar tool figure it is also interesting to look at design specifications for taws such as the technical standard order for such systems requires for the final approach segment warning be given in time to allow for obstacle clear altitude after recovery that includes pilot response time and standard gravitational era of the tso further describes the altitude loss of an aircraft de at with response time of one second and as being and says the required warning should be given no later than ft above the obstacle figure in comparison with these gate of ft agl to execute provides adequate altitude margin for even the most extreme unstable the margin in this case results in percent increase over the linear part percent increase over the fsf alar determination and percent increase over the taws although the number of approach and landing accidents is greater than the number of the around phase of flight has more fatalities per by ensuring safe altitude of ft to conduct in the extreme unstable and by allowing unstable approaches to continue between ft and the potential number of would be lower the exposure to comparisons of revised gates to industry monitoring and alerting and faa runway overrun prevention references the project identified significant benefits in reducing the subjectivity of the analysis by flight the most impactful way to minimize subjectivity is to employ automated systems similar in concept to ws figure altitude loss analysis unstable speed thrust vertical rate fpm loss from ft above ground fars part alar taws alar fsf approach and landing accident fars federal aviation taws terrain awareness and warning tso technical standard ref reference landing speed flight safety foundation tcas to help flight crews make timely and consistent the industry has developed few systems in the form of stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems for approach and landing energy the airbus runway overrun protection system has number of alerting and monitoring but those that are pertinent to this analysis are the visual alert that begins at ft agl and the aural alert at ft does evaluation of aircraft real energy and the runway distance available for and provides visual too alert at ft and an aural alert at ft because of the lower altitudes at which these alerts and considering the severity of the condition that not enough runway to stop the aircraft really is the only except in the most dire when comparing this condition to the conditions being applied to the proposed stabilized approach and the fsf guide are quite honeywell landing system also has many alerting and monitoring including aural alerts beginning at ft agl and ending at ft agl with an the criteria used by the system to make the alert are variable but based on monitoring excessive approach excessive speed and flap settings honeywell the altitudes where these alerts are given are similar to those recommended in the stabilized ap and achieving collective situational awareness through active communication this project found that situational awareness is lacking among most flight crews who continue an unstable descent and land communication is vital in achieving situational two key types of communication are recommended for improvements approach and landing brief and active communication sops throughout the approach and landing and briefings most airlines already have procedures for which ad the most important aspects of the approach and detailed guidance is provided in fsf alar briefing note safety foundation alar task the following guidance is not intended to replace those briefings but is an addition to current standard briefing improve overall ala awareness improve awareness of specific approach and landing as demonstrated in the project simply knowing few overall statistics can raise situational awareness fi when company statistics are they should be in their the following industry statistics can be alas make up approximately percent of all approximately percent of unstable approaches result in more than percent of runway excursions follow stable approach that becomes unstable after threshold reviewing the effects of runway contamination and tail winds on runway excursions is relevant because they contribute to significant number of runway the flight safety runway safety initiative found that about percent of runway landing excursions are of that percent follow stable of all percent were associated with and with runway the remaining per of runway landing excursions are and of that percent follow unstable approaches safety this project found that awareness of instabilities is important in the landing phase as well as in the approach some simple rules of thumb regarding the effect of poor landing technique on landing distance can significantly improve situational for pilots should plan for landing distances to in by ft per second of ft per kt excess speed from ref on dry ft per kt excess speed from ref on wet ft per ft excess above ft over runway this also applies when the vertical guidance for the ap by places the aircraft higher than ft agl when crossing the landing distances are based on threshold briefings including these statistics and rules of thumb should occur at intervals that will ensure that flight crews have an depth awareness of the for example briefings also should discuss any allowances for flight crews to adjust company policies discussion in safe landing as permitted by guided procedures in the policies themselves for allowing crew to conduct touchdown beyond the normal approach and and briefing briefing should in addition to existing approach briefing an emphasis on approach and landing when company statistics should be periodically the briefing should include approach and landing accident overall alas make up approximately percent of all approximately percent of runway excursions develop from approaches

heightened readiness should be discussed in the event of poor environmental any adjustments to approach and landing policy as permitted by written policy guidance landing beyond the normal touchdown zone if performance at an appropriate just prior to commencing the crews should recap current environmental readiness and any adjustments to policy flight safety foundation touchdown zone as long as adequate landing performance and distance references as briefings often occur minutes or more before an the project findings and suggest that short or refreshment of the current threats and be briefed just prior to the ap during period in the lower this can refresh and flight situational approach and and briefing active communication throughout the approach this project determined that communication is one of the key attributes of effective collaborative decision making by flight by factor of approximately flight crews who comply with their policy had uni about approach and for most crews who con an unstable approach and no one made the actual decision to that there was no communication about the decision to it just the difficulty with calls which are made only if prob condition exists is that in their it is undetermined if the condition the call could be absent for several as explained in the report active force flight crews to discuss or express condition either positive or negative on every it is also important not to overload the flight crew with standard communication and to ensure that they have time to listen to atc and perform other active calls must be short and calls are usually initiated by the pm and responded to by the the call on the approach normally indicates and the response by the pf may either be an ac or directional it is recommended that there be an active call at each ap if the active call indicates an undesired aircraft the call should continue to be made periodically throughout the approach at intervals such as each ft or until the desired state is achieved or is this serves the same purpose as warning from ws or repetitive calls in the to zone also pre the pf for an eventual conclusion if the offending ndi is not that repetitive warning calls prime the and relational as compared with common current procedures in which single go call is made at or which has lesser ef in primarily the hierarchical the implementation of active calls should not imply that and communicative calls such as or be passive calls remain an important component of situational awareness and should be used in with active calls as the following are examples of active calls at approach gates during an if an airline has stable approach and monitoring system such as or the need for complete series of active calls throughout the approach and landing

flight safety foundation fsf safe landing guidelines design rationale the following is the rationale behind the revised flight safety foundation guidelines for safe landing and achieving reliable decision making during the landing as with the stable approach and decision there were several namely that the guidelines make operational sense for both flight crews and manage to improve agreement with the ensure safety during landing by mitigating the common types of landing runway excursions and ensure the resultant are in situations of ap and not those of very low risk in which transfer of risk to maneuver increases overall and unnecessarily increases demands on improve the flight collective situational the guidelines established here do not replace manufacturer limitations and procedural or state regulations and excursions that occur following an unstable approach are mitigated largely in the approach they can still prevented in the landing large numbers of excursions occur following stable approach that becomes unstable only after the aircraft passes the runway thresh guidelines in this section are targeted at these types of landing excursions are of two in which aircraft run off the end of the runway surface and in which aircraft exit the side of the runway to address these types of we will enhance landing guidelines in four longitudinal limit awareness touchdown zone and lateral limit awareness environmental variability and adjustments to established situational awareness and project findings include that collective situational awareness is low during the landing and although most opera have policies defining where the touchdown should very few have guidance or sops on how to determine where the touchdown or how and when to determine if around should be for most operators spec that the aircraft should touch down in the touchdown zone on the they do not train or specify how to determine if the aircraft has passed the who should make the or how much of deviation from the runway centerline is permissible before should be most pilots say either gut feeling or experience helps them judge when an aircraft has passed the acceptable even though they readily state that their experience does not include from the landing the impact of improving collective situational awareness in the landing phase can be longitudinal limit awareness dz and touchdown zones vary in length with one determining factor being total runway runways of ft and longer have touchdown zones ft long and runways of and longer have touchdown zones long relative positioning markings are present within the dz and are clearly identifiable on the aiming point is the widest marking located at the distance from the threshold and distance from the threshold with the end of the dz being identified by the last marking at ft and approach alerting and monitoring systems such as smart provide aural alerts when an aircraft has passed touchdown when an aircraft passes this area without touching an aural alert such as deep is given honeywell sops then dictate this objective warning immediately enhances crew awareness and leads to better decision in the absence of such the through can be directed to monitor the passing of dz markings and make an active call such as or of after passing the last marking indicating the passage of the in cases in which

specify that the touchdown shall occur on the runway but do not say how this will hap or who will determine when the aircraft is as important as it is to have situational awareness regarding longitudinal it is equally important to understand lateral manufacturers often provide cockpit visual cues and techniques for determining where the main landing gear is in relation to the aircraft as an boeing says for the the view through lower outboard corner of the forward win to the ground is good visual reference for the outboard side of the main landing gear wheels on the same the lower inboard corner of the forward window is also good reference for the opposite side main gear boeing in the absence of other lateral maintaining the most outboard main landing gears on either side of the centerline is reasonable using visual as in the example can help determine the positioning of the main landing this is considered rough operational guide with its own there are no known alternatives other than relying on the monitor of this positioning can be performed by the pm during the and if he or she sees that the position of the aircraft is he can make an appropriate call in that sops would dictate environmental variability and adjustments to established policies environmental variability can have significant effect on land performance and desired touchdown operators should consider giving flight crews the tools and guidelines to determine when it makes sense to modify or adjust landing and policies for and possibly operational it can be difficult for some operators to consider allowing crew to land beyond the landing combined with sound guidance and policies for operating outside normal makes sense when safe operations are we also have the problem of rules with no room to apply kern said in of these policies begin with good but inside the good we create systems that defy logic and poison the well of which often results in an unintended consequence loss of faith in the system of problems can develop when environmental conditions are such that operating outside established policies makes but there are no guiding principles on how to accomplish for an aircraft landing on run requires landing although the company policy states that should be initiated if touchdown does not occur inside the is it the best course of action as opposed to an option of extending the touchdown point to ft for the answer is if the mark is not if the flight crew can identify this point and if they have briefed the revision to the is it still the best course of action to go in this the transfer of risk to is revised touchdown point can be determined by citing known distance point along the runway taxi runway distance marker or time period one second approximates ft in in another case in which weather and runway conditions demand that touchdown occur before the end of the guid should give crews the methods and means to identify the shorter touchdown for if the crew wants to be touching down within ft of the runway thresh they need references to determine where this will using dz markings or time lapse from the time the aircraft crosses the in any written policies and guidance must be in place to give the flight crew procedures and techniques to modify landing point this should be briefed and agreed upon by all figure approach and landing gates and active end of dz of of deep window window not window not dz touchdown zone calls can be substituted with auto such as flight safety foundation situational awareness and communication figure shows examples of new active calls recommended in the landing phase of in the case of exceeding centerline touchdown it is difficult to define point in the dz where positive centerline active call can be although not in this the use of call may be more that the call is made only when the drift limit is note that stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems accomplish the objectives of some active flight crew calls would not be fsf recommended elements of stabilized approach recommended elements of stabilized approach all flights must be stabilized by ft above airport

The Missed Approach – Hey Where’s the Runway?1Missed Approach SegmentA Missed approach is a procedure used when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing The Missed Approach Segment is that part of an instrument approach procedure between the missed approach point (MAP), the missed approach way-point (MAWP), or the point of arrival at the decision height and the specified missed approach NAVAID (navigational aid), intersection, fix, or waypoint, as appropriate, at the minimum IFR altitude It is in this part of the approach procedure that the aircraft will climb and return to the en route structure or is positioned for holding or subsequent approach The missed approach route and altitudes are shown on the instrument approach charts2The Missed ApproachThe missed approach is one of the most difficult and critical phases of an instrument approach and is the one practiced the least High workload, as the configuration of the aircraft must be changed (approach to climb out), coupled with new navigation route/Navaids An approach in actual conditions should be flown with the anticipation that the missed approach is an anticipated outcome The missed approach procedure typically includes an initial heading or track to follow, and an altitude to climb to.  This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix Be sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach FAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed: 1.  Whenever: Flight visibility is less than the specified visibility for the approach If required visual references are not seen at either of the following times:  When the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or Upon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DA/DH where a DA/DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that until touchdown. 2.  Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References FAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA: The approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable The threshold The threshold markings The visual approach slope indicator The threshold lights The runway end identifier lights (REIL) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings The touchdown zone lights The runway or runway markings The runway lights Basic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting 6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible Full scale needle deflection past the final approach fix Navigation equipment required for the approach fails ATC instructs you to go missed Unsafe runway Traffic Controller or pilot navigation errors Weather – e.g., thunderstorm cell When the aircraft is being operated below MDA – loss of visual references If your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure A controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions Verbal Missed Approach Instructions ATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach ATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required ATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency]. Be advised [Traffic...]“ If executing instructions different from those on the procedure as dictated by approach, call “on the go\" or \"executing climb out\" to reduce confusion 9Missed Approach Chart SymbolsTo provide ready missed approach guidance, approach plates use quick reference icons Due to limited space only four or less icons can be shown. Hence the icons may not show the entire missed approach procedure The full missed approach instructions are provided textually at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing10JEPP Missed Approach Chart Symbols11NACO Missed Approach Chart Symbols12Climb to altitudeTurn to specified headingTo Specified fixTrack RadialMissed Approach Point LocationThe missed approach point (MAP) on a non-precision approach is not designed with any consideration to where the aircraft must begin descent to execute a safe landing It is developed based on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and possibly air traffic considerations Descent below the MDA, including during the missed approach, is not authorized The Decision Altitude (DA) is an altitude derived location where a missed approach will be initiated on a precision approach Obstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach Decision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). 13Obstacle Protection Obstacle protection is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the DA/H or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA) A climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart When higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix Preplan your approach to ensure you can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile)  Higher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute) Tables for climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are on page D1 of U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets Formula: Required Climb Per Minute = ((_[climb gradient]_ ft/nautical mile) x ([ground speed] nautical miles/hour)/60) = 36,000 feet per hour = 14Beginning the Procedure Other Than at the MAP/DHIn the design of the missed approach procedure no consideration is given to an abnormally early missed approach turn from the approach course When an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC,  Fly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point  Remain at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver Can begin climb early, absent altitude restrictions Think CFIT when making an early missed!!15Circling Approach MAPExecuting the missed approach after starting the circling maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP The missed approach is executed for the runway the approach started on, not the runway you were circling to The initial turn on a missed approach will always be towards the landing runway until established on a segment of the missed approach Always think about how to execute the missed approach while circling so it is not a surprise if you enter IMC as aircraft is clear of obstacles only when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area16Since the circling missed approach maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost.Flying the Missed ApproachBefore the FAF  Memorize initial altitudes and headings Set up No. 2 Nav if possible for missed approach initial navaid course17Flying the Missed Approach Initial Missed Approach Segment ProcedureAt the MAP / DA Add climb power Rotate gradually (on-speed) to Vx Check for positive rate of climb Clean up the aircraft – gear and flaps up in the order specified by the POH Climb out at appropriate speed18CommunicateUpon execution of a missed approach and becoming stabilized in climb notify ATC If communicating with the Tower - \"[Place] tower, [Callsign], missed approach [Reason]\" If communicating with approach - \"[Place] approach, [Callsign] missed approach off of [Location] climbing through [Altitude] for [Altitude] with request\"19Lost Communications Missed ApproachIf communications are lost during the approach and you take a missed approach: Squawk 7600 Follow the published missed approach instructions to ensure adequate obstruction clearance Route: Proceed to the alternate IAF as filed and commence an approach Altitude: The EXPECTED altitude, if given one, after filing a “DRAFT” or; Your option of the highest of the two emergency safe altitudes depicted on the destination and alternate approach procedure charts if fields are within 200 NM of each other or At flight level 18,000' If destination altimeter is 29.92 inches or higher, fly FL180 If destination altimeter is less than 29.92, fly FL190 \"DRAFT\": Short flight plan including - a) Destination; b) Route; c) Altitude; d) Fuel State and e) Time En-route20NOW WHATDecide what your course of action will be Repeat the same approach at the same airport Another approach at the same airport Divert to planned alternate Divert elsewhere Hold for conditions to improve Consider fuel load and distance / time to a good alternate Inform ATC of your desires21Alternate Missed ApproachSome locations may have a preplanned alternate missed approach procedure for use in the event the primary NAVAID used for the missed approach procedure is out of service To avoid confusion, the alternate missed approach instructions are not published on the chart However, the alternate missed approach holding pattern will be depicted on the instrument approach chart  When the alternate missed approach procedure is implemented by NOTAM, it becomes a mandatory part of the procedure. The NOTAM will specify both the textual instructions and any additional equipment requirements necessary to complete the procedure You may reject an ATC clearance for an alternate missed approach that requires equipment not necessary for the published approach procedure when the alternate missed approach is issued after beginning the approach However, if the alternate missed approach is issued prior to beginning the approach the pilot must either accept the entire procedure (including the alternate missed approach) or request a different approach procedure22G1000 Missed ApproachAt the MAP, “SUSP” is displayed in the HSI and directly above the SUSP softkey Automatic sequencing of approach waypoints is suspended at the MAP A “FROM” indication is displayed on the CDI, but the course guidance is simply an extension of the final approach course  Do NOT follow this extended course When the message “RAIM is not available” is displayed in the Alerts Window on the PFD a missed approach must also be executed23G1000 Missed ApproachFlying the Missed Initiate the missed approach sequence by following the missed approach procedures as published / directed by ATC, for proper climb and heading instructions If not already using GPS as nav source, press the CDI softkey to switch external CDI output to GPS for guidance.  Press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic sequencing of waypoints If there is a missed approach course from a fix to altitude, Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to resume automatic leg sequencing After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD The G1000 will guide to the missed approach holding point and a recommended entry procedures for the holding pattern will be shown24G1000 Missed ApproachNote that the G1000 at the holding point again displays “SUSP” above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern The G1000 provides course guidance only on the inbound side of the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern to re-fly the approach, press the PROC key to “Select Approach” or “Activate Approach” (or use the Direct-To key to select another destination)  25G1000 Missed Approach Example Missed Approach Course From Fix To AltitudeAfter pressing the SUSP softkey, the missed approach sequence is automatically started with the course from fix to altitude leg After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey -  The G1000 returns to suspend mode when flying a course from a fix to altitude leg and indicates that automatic leg sequencing is suspended Fly the outbound course keeping the CDI needle centered. The Navigation Map Page depicts the flight path extending indefinitely from the Navfix. The distance increases and indicates the distance back to the Navaid Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic leg sequencing. Confirm that ‘SUSP’ no longer is displayed directly above the SUSP softkey The message “NEXT DTK 123” is the displayed, providing guidance to the holding fix. The actual desired track (DTK) depends on the ground speed and distance from the Navaid. Intercept and fly the inbound course, keeping the CDI needle centered As the plane approaches the Navaid (the missed approach holding point), a message in the navigation status bar recommends the holding pattern entry, e.g., “HOLD PARALLEL” Note that the G1000 again displays ‘SUSP’ above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern, press the PROC key to reactivate the approach or select a different approach, or press the Direct-To key to select another destination26G1000 Missed Approach Additional AutomationGA Switch (Go-Around)  Disengages the autopilot Selects the flight director Go-Around Mode, and  Activates the missed approach The GA Switch is located on the instrument panel above the throttle TOGA (Takeoff/Go-Around) Switch Offers automated go-arounds At the MAP, press the TOGA button Keeps the AP engaged Commands a climb Sets Autopilot to NAV mode and  Sequences to the missed approach 27Pitch-up IllusionPitch-up illusion is a significant hazard during the transition to climb out On approach the portion of the inner ear that provides sensory information related to acceleration—provides the sensation of stabilized speed, based primarily on the forces of gravity When acceleration and climb occur simultaneously as during the initial segment of a missed approach, two forces come together - gravity and acceleration The brain resolves the two forces (gravity and acceleration) as a single resultant force acting downward and backward. The brain incorrectly resolves the two forces as a single pitch-up movement When that occurs, the pilot feels as though the aircraft is climbing or that the nose is pitching up, when, in fact, it remains in level flight.   The normal reaction, absent visual clues, to the pitch-up illusion is to push forward on the stick with the risk of ground contact in a missed approach28Common ErrorsFailure to have essential knowledge of the information on the approach chart Failure to have initial steps of missed approach committed to memory Failure to identify DH or MAP or other condition requiring a missed approach Incorrect communication procedures  Noncompliance with ATC clearances, the published missed approach or an ATC instruction or failure to notify ATC of inability to comply Failure to accomplish checklist items Faulty basic instrument flying techniques Failure to accomplished a missed approach timely – e.g. motoring on to look for references29PTS Standards Area of Operation VI.

C.Adequate knowledge of the missed approach procedure elements for standard approaches Initiates the missed approach promptly by applying power, establishing a climb attitude, and reducing drag in accordance with the aircraft manufacturer’s recommendations Reports beginning the missed approach procedure to ATC Complies with the published or alternate missed approach procedure Advises ATC or examiner anytime that the aircraft is unable to comply with a clearance, restriction, or climb gradient Follows the recommended checklist items appropriate to the go-around procedure Requests, if appropriate, ATC clearance to the alternate airport, clearance limit, or as directed by the examiner Maintains the recommended airspeed within ±10 knots; heading, course, or bearing within ±10°; and altitude(s) within ±100 feet during the missed approach procedure. Uses MFD and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position and track to help navigate the missed approach. Demonstrates an appropriate level of single-pilot resource management skills.31Questions32DisclaimerInstrument flight can be dangerous.
