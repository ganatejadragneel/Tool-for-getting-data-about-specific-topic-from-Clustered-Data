The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The boundaries of the flight envelope will be defined within this document. All speeds are calibrated airspeeds (CAS) (requirement 4.4 ) and given in knots if not stated otherwise. All other units used are metric (SI units). The weights are given in mass units (kg) but the formulas require force units as input, therefore these are calculated in place wherever they are used. Note: The speeds defined within this document should be used for the placards, speed markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by flight test.

Maximum speed in level flight VH According to flight tests  at maximum weight and maximum continuous power at sea level conditions, the maximum speed in level flight has been determined:  Stall speeds VS, VS0, VS1 These speeds will be verified by flight test according to requirement 4.4.1 .  In order to calculate the stall speed, the maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane as a whole is determined first. The maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane has been calculated starting from the polar curve of the wing profile taken form ref.  (p. 236, Re=2.9E6 flaps retracted  and p.237,  for the flaps in landing configuration, and  in take-off configuration). Considering the horizontal tail balancing force and the lower total wing lift due to wing lift distribution, the total aeroplane lift coefficient has been lowered by 15% with respect to the one of the profile.   Therefore aeroplane lift coefficient is estimated to   and for the landing configuration (since the span extension of the flaps is half of the span of the wing):  Stall speeds have been calculated based on these calculated lift coefficients. The wetted wing area SW is used instead of total wing area S because of a lower lift within the fuselage section of the span. Flaps retracted (take-off configuration):  Flaps extended (landing configuration):  Flaps extended (take-off configuration):  With . The stall speed in landing configuration (flaps fully extended to 40 degrees) is 44 kts. Therefore it is In accordance with CS-LSA.5 . In Take-Off configuration (flaps extended to 20 degrees) the stall speed is 47 kts. (Note: These speeds are estimates. The methods for the estimation can be various. It is important that these estimations are as precise as possible. Flight tests will be used to validate the stall speeds. In case the flight tests show different values, this might have an impact on the speeds used for design and ultimately might impair the compliance to the CS-LSA.5.)  Design manoeuvring speed VA According to requirement 5.2.4.1     Flaps maximum operating speed VF According to requirement 5.2.4.2 , such speed shall be not less than the greater of      and   The speed has been selected as:            This is the maximum flap operating speed for the take-off (at 20 degrees) and landing flap settings at 40 degrees. Flaps maximum extension speed VFE On this aeroplane the maximum flap extension speed is identical to the flap operating speed VF.  This speed is the maximum speed for flaps in take-off and landing configuration. Design cruising speed VC According to requirement 5.2.4.3    may not be less than:  and need not be greater than:  The speed has been selected as:  (Note:  can be selected to be higher than  .) (Note:  and VDF ,VD ,VNE correlate with each other. should be selected to allow for a minimum margin of 22% to VDF in order to be able to satisfy the requirements for the next subchapters.) Design dive speed VD According to requirement 5.2.4.4   For  a higher value than the one above has been chosen:  (Note: ASTM F2245-12d 5.2.4.4  requires an exact value for the dive speed. Indeed, such value should be understood as a minimum value. This will be clarified in the next amendment of the CS-LSA.)  Demonstrated dive speed VDF According to requirement 4.1.1.1  VDF must be less than or equal to VD. In this case VDF is equal to VD:  (Note: In case the demonstrated VDF is lower than VD then VNE needs to be limited accordingly which could have an impact on the selection of VC as well.) Never exceed speed VNE According to requirement 4.1.1.2  the VNE Shall be greater than or equal to:  and  must be less than or equal to:  The speed has been selected as:  Note: If the aircraft is equipped with retractable landing gear then VLO must be determined as well (CS-LSA.15 6.12.2). Altitude The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. In fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)  Manoeuvring and Gust load factors n Summary of limit load factors according to certification specifications and gust requirements. Table 2 – Manoeuvring limit load factors  Gust envelope Gust load factors need to be considered because they can exceed the prescribed maximum load factors at different weights and altitudes. Since gust loads depend on air density and aircraft mass they will be calculated for all twelve cases (sea level and 10000ft=FL100, maximum, minimum flying weight and minimum flying weight with full wing fuel tanks) according to requirement 5.2.3.3  with flaps retracted (requirement 5.2.6.1 ) and fully extended (requirement 5.2.6.2 ) at . The calculation is based on appendix X3 . To calculate the gust loads at altitudes other than at sea level the formula X3.1  is altered to include the density at sea level  as well:  The corresponding weights are defined within . Since the gust loads on the wing and tail have been chosen to be treated together,  is the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane (). (Note: the applicant should provide the method for the calculation of the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane)  Table 3 – Gust load factors V-n Envelope Below a typical flight envelope is shown. This specific one is corresponding to MTOW and FL100. For other design weights the shape of the envelope remains similar, with the difference that the gust lines will change (due to different load factors as per Table 3).

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. Within this document the loads on the wings are determined throughout the whole flight envelope  and for the design weights as determined in  under all loading conditions. The simplified criteria of requirement X.1  have not been used for these calculations. The Loads are calculated using literature methods taken from the documents referenced in chapter 1. The following assumptions are made: Applicable to LSA only; no compressibility effects; conventional configuration (e.g. no tandem aircraft, bi-plane or canard); no pitching moment of the horizontal tail (symmetrical profile); no winglets, no wing tip tanks; no sweep, straight leading edge, no twist, constant profile, no dihedral; effect of the wing deformation on the loads not considered; no spoilers or airbrakes; landing gear attached to fuselage;  no wing struts (cantilever wing);     References List of Abbreviations CG centre of gravity LE leading edge ISA international standard atmosphere by International Organisation for Standardisation  KEAS knots equivalent airspeed MAC mean aerodynamic chord MTOW maximum take-off weight SI international system of units  angle of attack of the wing [deg]  local angle of attack of the station i [deg]  wing zero lift angle of attack [deg]  profile zero lift angle of attack [deg] a lift curve slope [1/deg] AR wing aspect ratio calculated by  [] b wing span [m]  average wing span at station i (mid span position of station) [m]  wing span position of MAC [m]  average fuselage width at wing section [m]  maximum fuselage width (equals ) [m]  local angle between resulting force and normal force at station [deg]  average chord at station i [m]  mean aerodynamic chord [m]  chord at wing root  [m]  chord at wing tip [m]  shear axis relative position as a fraction of local wing chord []  drag coefficient  []  lift coefficient  []  fuselage pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift profile pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient [] D drag force on the wings [N] d span wise drag line loading []  wing sweep of the quarter chord line [deg]  g gravity acceleration [m/s2]  fuselage moment factor []  total wing lift force (on both wings) [N]  local lift at station i [N]  lift line loading on the wing [N/m]  total horizontal tail lift force [N]  total fuselage length [m]  fuselage length in front of wing quarter mean aerodynamic chord point [m]  taper ratio (equals  ) []  wing pitching moment with lift acting on its aerodynamic centre [N]  moments around y axis [Nm]  normal force [N] n load factor [] num total number of stations of a single wing; num = 10 []   density of ambient air at a specific altitude []  running horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  incremental horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  running vertical shear force at station I (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  incremental vertical shear force at station i (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  local resulting force at station i [N] S wing area (not including wing carry-through) []  local tangential force at station i [N]  total torsion around elastic axis of the wing (at wing root) [mN]  local torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  incremental torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  dynamic viscosity (for Reynolds number) [] v airspeed [m/s] W total aircraft weight [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload)  [kg/m2]  total weight of a single wing (with no fuel or payload) [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload) [kg/m2] x longitudinal axis of the aircraft [m] distance to HT quarter chord line from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to aircraft centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to fuel centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE at station i [m]   aerodynamic centre shift due to fuselage pitching moment [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing-fuselage combination with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing fuselage combination from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord)  [m]    shear axis of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m] y lateral axis of the aircraft (span wise direction) [m]  average wing span position at station i [m]  spanwise width of station i [m] z vertical axis of the aircraft [m]  Throughout this document SI-units are used with speeds expected as m/s and angles in degrees if not stated otherwise. Requirements This document covers the following certification specifications requirements: Table 1 – Requirements   Input data The values shown below are derived from design data or other compliance documents for this particular aeroplane.   Load Calculation  The following steps have been followed: Load cases: First, the load cases have been identified in, in terms of weight, centre of gravity, speed, load factor, flap/aileron position, Altitude.  External Loads on the wing: for all load cases, the loads on the wing are calculated; Internal Loads in the wing: for the same load cases the internal loads in the wing (shear, bending moment, torsion) are calculated considering also the effect of the inertia of the wing;  Load cases Table 3 comprises all load cases corresponding to the points of the flight envelope  and design weights and centres of gravity .  Important:  Loads corresponding to flap deflected are considered not critical for the wing and will not be calculated in this document (flap loads will be calculated instead for the flap verification). Loads corresponding to landing conditions are considered not critical for the wing (since the landing gear is attached to the fuselage and no tip tanks or other large masses under the wing) and will not be calculated in this document. For the gust load calculations the wing and horizontal tail are treated together according to X3.1 in ref. . The resulting gust load accelerations are therefore calculated using the slope of the lift curve of the aeroplane (see also ) and treated as balanced flight conditions within this document.  Note: These assumptions have been considered realistic for this aeroplane but they are not of generic validity. It is the responsibility of the applicant to define the set of assumptions which can be acceptable for the particular aeroplane.   Altitude: The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. in fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)    Figure 1 – Reference flight envelope (WMTOW, FL 100) Table 2 – Design weights (explained in ref. ) Table 3 – Load cases Note: For this revision of this example document, asymmetric load cases have not been calculated. Loads on the aeroplane Reference axes and sign convention  Figure 2 – Aeroplane reference axes The origin is located at the airplane axis of symmetry (x axis) with the y axis passing through the leading edge of the mean aerodynamic chord section of the wing. Symmetrical flight conditions The loads on the wing structure arising from symmetrical flight manoeuvres according to requirements 5.2.2 and 5.2.3  are determined within this chapter.  The following abbreviations are used within this chapter (all measurements with respect to wing leading edge at wing mean aerodynamic chord, forces acting according to arrows are positive) x longitudinal axis of the aircraft z vertical axis of the aircraft CG aircraft centre of gravity HT horizontal tail L lift force on the wings  horizontal tail balancing force (HT lift force)  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient (lift force assumed to act on  )  total pitching moment (must be zero for equilibrium) n W aircraft total weight force (= m*n*g )  distance to HT quarter chord line (of HT MAC as quarter chord line)  distance to aircraft centre of gravity  distance to wing fuselage combination centre of pressure   (lift force acting on not generating any pitching moment)  distance to wing fuselage combination aerodynamic centre   (lift force acting on generating constant pitching moment ) The external forces and moments acting on the aeroplane in a balanced flight condition have been determined. The\\xa0simplified scheme in Figure 3 is considered. The aeroplane is reduced to the wing and the Horizontal tail.  Figure 3 – Aeroplane simplified scheme The following forces are considered and placed in equilibrium:  Lift on the wing; Horizontal tail balancing load according to requirement 5.2.2.1 ; Weight of the aeroplane; For the calculation of the equilibrium, the z-axis of the aeroplane is assumed aligned with the direction of the gravity. In a second stage (section 6.4), once the forces are calculated, the corresponding angle of attack will be considered for the calculation of the correct direction of the forces on the wing;  Influence of thrust and drag (of the total airplane) are considered negligible at this stage of calculation of the vertical forces. The effect of the drag will be considered in a second stage on the wing only; The wing lift is assumed to act on the aerodynamic centre of the wing as a starting point. The contribution of the fuselage is accounted for as a shift of the point of aerodynamic centre. This is better explained in section 6.1.5. The HT lift is applied at 25% of the chord; Effects of structural flexure are considered negligible; Angular accelerations are disregarded until the aeroplane has attained the prescribed load factor (according to requirement 5.2.2.3 ); Note: The assumptions above provide a clear simplification to the calculations. The fact that they are used here does not mean that they can always be used. It is the responsibility of the designer to make the appropriate assumptions and to agree them with the Agency. Based on the above assumptions the following equilibrium equations are set. The basis system of equations include 4 equations with the following unknowns: L: wing Lift (including fuselage) CL: wing lift coefficient LHT: HT lift XAC f+w: aerodynamic centre w+f (wing + fuselage; see sec. 6.1.3 and 6.1.5) Equilibrium of moments  (f. 6.1.2.1) Equilibrium of forces   (f. 6.1.2.2) wing pitching moment   (f.6.1.2.3) (for wing) wing lift coefficient  (f. 6.1.2.4) Aerodynamic centre The aerodynamic centre is a characteristic of the wing and it is defined as the point about which the pitch moment does not change with changes of the angle of attack throughout the linear range of the lift curve.  According to  the aerodynamic centre can be estimated by adding a correction factor (shift) to the quarter chord point of the mean aerodynamic chord. The correction factor is a function of the maximum thickness of the profile which in this wing is 16% of the chord. For a tapered wing, the mean aerodynamic chord corresponds to the mean chord and it is  (see ). For this wing the correction factor is 0.012 (from Fig.2  at 16% thickness), so the mean aerodynamic centre of the wing without fuselage is    (f. 6.1.3.1) Pitching moment of the wing The pitching moment of the profile from two dimensional wind tunnel test data  does not represent the moment of a three dimensional with the profile. The pitching moment of the whole wing is calculated according to DATCOM method 1 (formula 4.1.4.1.a ).  (formula 4.1.4.1.a ) (f. 6.1.4.1) With quarter chord sweep angle of the wing .   Influence of the fuselage The fuselage is assumed to provide negligible lift. On the other hand, its influence on the aeroplane equilibrium is accounted for as a contribution to the pitching moment. In particular the following formula (taken from ref ) provides the shift of the aerodynamic centre of the wing due to fuselage pitching moment.  (f. 6.1.5.1) With  and  as input to the diagram in  yielding  and a correction factor of 1.05 due to low-wing configuration. The shift of aerodynamic centre, due to the fuselage, is calculated as:   (f. 6.1.5.2) Forces and moments acting on the wings In previous chapter the Lift and the lift coefficient have been determined. Having those as inputs, the drag and angle of attack are calculated. Total wing drag coefficient  (FIG. X2.1 of)(f. 6.2.1) Drag force on the wings  (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.2) The angle of attack (using as reference instead of ) for each load case is calculated using the following formula:   (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.3) Where: lift curve slope    (FIG. X2.1 of ) (f. 6.2.4) and the zero-lift angle of the wing is taken as . This value is the zero-lift angle of the corresponding wing profile, taken from ref  (p.236).   The results of this chapter for the load cases highlighted in subchapter 0 are presented within the table below. Table 4 – Loads on the aeroplane Unsymmetrical flight conditions Note: These load cases will not be calculated within this revision of the example document.   Wing load distribution After having calculated the total load on the wing, the load distribution is calculated and shown in the following sections. Every load is assumed to act on the span wise centre of each station.  Figure 4 – Location of wing stations Wing lift distribution The wing lift distribution is calculated here. The lift contribution of the fuselage is assumed to be zero (this means that the load which would act in correspondence of the fuselage, is shifted externally to the wing) leading to more conservative results on the wing loads since they provide higher bending. Note: Alternatively, the applicant would have to determine the reduction in wing lift distribution at the location of the fuselage and demonstrate the validity of the approach.  Figure 5 – Effect of the fuselage, areas A (total lift calculated at the end of this chapter)  and B (total lift according to Schrenk) are of equal size   This approach is based on the approximation described by Schrenk  and requires adjustments: moving the apex of the elliptical distribution from the fuselage centre towards the wing root increasing lift of wetted wing sections to compensate for zero lift of fuselage wing section The formula for wing lift distribution is derived from Schrenk  and is altered to assume zero lift at the wing section within the fuselage as shown below. The formula gives the value of the lift for span unit. “i” identifies the individual station.   Figure 6 –  lift distribution with zero lift at fuselage wing section   ()  (f. 6.4.1.1) Now the lift of the wing section within the fuselage is redistributed across the wetted wing area to achieve conservative results. The lift distribution calculated above is adjusted by multiplication of a correction factor derived from comparison between total lift of the whole wing including the fuselage section and the wetted wing only.  Figure 7 – Fuselage wing section lift redistributed across wetted wing stations        or  (f. 6.4.1.2) The lift distribution corresponding to the formula above, gives a value of lift at wing tip which is higher than zero and therefore does not fully reproduce the actual loading (the winglift is normally zero at the tip). Nevertheless this assumption does not give significant changes and yields conservative results. The local angle of attack for the station I, as a result of this corrected Schrenk distribution, is given by the following formula:  (from f.6.2.3 and f.6.1.2.4) (f. 6.4.1.3) Note: FAA AC 23-19A, paragraph 23.301, contains other acceptable methods.   Figure 9 – Span wise lift distribution  Wing drag distribution Since the effect of the drag is negligible, when compared to the effect of the lift, the span wise drag distribution has been assumed constant throughout wing span. This is a conservative assumption. The drag loading per metre of span:   (f. 6.4.2.1) Wing and fuel mass distribution The local masses are calculated for each wing station to account for the mass of the structure of the wing including the systems and control surfaces (control systems, and other equipment). It is assumed that the wing has a linear distribution proportional to the chord. At each station the point of application of the mass is 45% of the chord.  Figure 10 – Wing mass distribution  Figure 11 – Fuel distribution A constant fuel distribution (at a point of application of 20% of the chord) is assumed throughout the fuel tank span.  Table 5 – Mass distribution with full fuel Wing torsion distribution At each station, the wing lift is assumed to be acting at the local centre of pressure, which is calculated using the formula:  (from eq. 9.17.(d) )  (f. 6.4.4.1) Where, ci is the chord at each station, cm0_w_i is the pitching moment around the aerodynamic centre of the wing section (it is -0.0436 across the wing from chapter 6.1.4), CL_i is the local lift coefficient and comes from the corrected Schrenk distribution () in 6.1.5. Therefore centre of pressure location is dependent on the local angle of attack. Each station’s lift force acts on its centre of pressure and imposes torsion around the wing elastic axis which for this aeroplane is located approximately at a constant chord percentage of 30% (see design data - the main spar is approximately at 25% of the chord) throughout the entire wing span with local positions  as local shear centres at the stations. Note: the location of the elastic axis for this wing has been assumed at 30%. It is responsibility of the applicant to determine and justify the location of the elastic axis.  Incremental torsion load on structure at each station with respect to local wing shear centre including contribution of fuel and wing structure inertia forces:   (f..2) Torsion at each station i (with respect to shear centre) is:    (f. 6.4.4.3) Distribution of internal loads The components of the internal loads on the wing structure are calculated in different steps for each station. The flight load factor n is assumed to act in parallel to the direction of the lift force instead of the direction of the normal force (As required by 5.2.1.1 of ref. ). The difference is assumed negligible. The incremental shear load parallel to lift force vector at station i is taking into account also the inertia unloading of the wing   (f. 6.4.5.1) Incremental shear load parallel to drag force vector at station i:   (f. 6.4.5.2) With  representing the width of the station i. The summation of incremental shear loads throughout the stations to obtain the absolute shear loads at station i is presented below. Shear load parallel to lift force vector   (f..3) Shear load parallel to drag force vector   (f. 6.4.5.4) The components of the loads along the normal and tangential directions are derived by using the following formulas and figure:  Figure 12 – Forces components on the wing (The tangential force is oriented opposite to the x axis and is therefore positive when directed towards the front of the aeroplane.) Resulting force angle   (f.6.4.5.5)  Shear loads along the directions of:  resulting force  (f. 6.4.5.6)  tangential force  (f. 6.4.5.7)  normal force  (f. 6.4.5.8) With the local angle of attack for the station i as a result of the corrected Schrenk distribution given by the following formula:  (from f. 6.4.1.4) Summation of shear loads to obtain the bending moments at each station and using the increased lever arm ( instead of  ) at the wing tip station results in slightly more conservative values. Bending moment along normal direction   (f. 6.4.5.9) Bending moment along tangential direction    (f. 6.4.5.10) The results are presented within the graphs and tables below.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The permissible centre of gravity range is dictated by the aerodynamic design requirements for the airplane. Then the centre of gravity locations corresponding to the critical weights are calculated. All units used are metric (SI units) except for airspeeds (CAS) given in knots if not stated otherwise. Note: The values defined within this document should be used for the placards, markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by testing.

The data contained herein is used to establish aeroplane loading limits: Table 2 – Mass items (Note: In this document the weight of the empty aircraft is assumed to be determined through direct weighing. Such information might be needed during early phases of the design, when no prototype is available. In this case the weight of the empty aircraft should be determined through estimation. It is important in this case to have a breakdown of the main items in terms of weight and locations, so that the weight can be kept under control and avoid situations where the assumed envelope cannot be achieved.) Aircraft weights The following design weights have been identified since: either they are clearly required by the CS-LSA requirements, or they impose critical loads or flight characteristics. Basic empty weight WBEW The basic empty weight needs to be determined to identify its centre of gravity according to requirement 4.2.3  as empty CG. All load conditions determined within this document are based on the basic empty weight of the aircraft. It includes empty weight of the aircraft and the unusable amount of fuel. Basic empty weight has been determined to WBEW = 366 kg. Note: The basic empty weight must include all equipment for the operation intended including optional avionics packages – for example. Basic empty weight (366 kg) vs maximum empty weight WMEW (400kg) According to 4.2.1 of , the minimum useful load  should be 200kg consisting of 172Kg = both seats occupied with persons of 86kg each (4.2.1.1 ) 28kg = fuel for 1 hour flight at  as determined by  (4.2.1.2 ) According to 3.1.2  the maximum empty weight of the aeroplane shall be equal to: . The aeroplane complies with its Basic empty weight including unusable fuel: . Minimum flying weight Wmin (421kg) The minimum flying weight needs to be determined by requirement 4.2.2  and is a design load case leading to highest load factors during gust penetration. It assumes only a pilot of weight of 55 kg.  Minimum full fuel flying weight WminFF (495kg) The minimum flying weight with full fuel is a design load case imposing highest load factors on the fuel tank. This is critical for the fuel tank design and it can be critical also for the wing structure since in this scenario the highest inertia load on the fuel tank introduces torsion about the shear centre in the same direction of the wing aerodynamic load of the wing (the CG of the fuel is forward to the shear centre which is forward to the wing centre of pressure). Maximum zero wing fuel weight WZWF (600kg) The maximum zero wing fuel weight needs to be determined by requirement 5.2.1.3  and is a design load case for the wing loads due to lowest inertia discharge of the wing structure. In this aeroplane this weight equals the Maximum Take-off weight.  Maximum take-off weight WMTOW (600kg) The total aircraft weight must not exceed 600kg regardless whether the aircraft is on ground or in flight. The gross weight of the aeroplane shall not exceed WMTOW = 600kg. The maximum landing weight equals the maximum take-off weight. Loading cases The following loading conditions have been established to identify the critical cases. Table 3 – Loading cases for standard configuration   Centre of gravity location The maximum permissible centre of gravity locations are defined within this chapter. Flight limits The maximum permissible centre of gravity range during flight with respect to datum plane is most forward 0.25m   (required by  4.2.3) most rearward 0.39m   (required by  4.2.3) Limitations on ground The most rearward centre of gravity with the plane on ground must not exceed (with respect to datum plane) 0.46m to prevent the aircraft from flipping on the tail although not more than 0.41m might be reached with the most critical loading configuration. Centre of gravity envelope The following table of load cases defines the limits for the certified envelope of centre of gravity locations and the position of load cases of 6.7 within the envelope. Table 4 – Load cases on centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration   The centre of gravity envelope covers all valid loading cases.  Figure 1 – Centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration Expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification To cover alterations to the aeroplane where need might arise or after certification the aeroplane will be tested and certified against an extended envelope. Additional weights will be added during testing at their corresponding locations to establish the desired loading cases. Table 5 – Weights required to achieve expanded envelope for certification   The expanded centre of gravity envelope is defined by the load cases below using ballast weights at their corresponding locations. Table 6 – Load cases on expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification Note: The values above are preliminary assumptions. Ballast weights need to be checked to be in accordance with airframe strength limitations and their impact on the flight characteristics in terms of inertia before test flights. This might require narrowing the centre of gravity envelope.  Figure 2 – Expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification Compliance statements Compliance statements are shown below:      ']\n"

Pilots are expected to remain within the protected airspace (the holding side). One of the elements which caus es unnecessary confusion and anxiety is  the holding pattern entry. Holding pattern entry procedures are not mandatory , they are merely a recommendation (as long as the airplane remains within the protected  airspace). The recommendation is based on three types of entries, depending on the sector from which the airplane arri ves at the holding fix. These are the direct, parallel and tear-dropentries.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding PatternsStandardholding  pattern -all turns made   to right.The inbound legof a holding pattern is 1 minuteat & below 14,000 ft. and 1.5  minutes above 14,000  ft.Outbound leg should be adjustedto yield a 1  minute inbound leg.Timing of the outbound leg should begin either abeam  the fix or after completing the outbound turn.Each holding pattern has a fix, a direction to hold FROM the fix, and an airway, bearing, course, radial, or route on which the aircraft is to hold.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding PatternsDME leg length may be used  instead of time  for holding  patterns.When used, DME leg length  refers to the  outbound leg  length.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding PatternsYou should triplethe crosswind  correction  needed on the  inbound leg to  determine the  outbound leg  heading.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Speed LimitsMaximum holding speeds are established to keep aircraft within the protected holding area during their one-minute (one-minute and a half above 14,000ft MSL) inbound and  outbound legs.

A holding clearance includes:ŁDirection from the fix  ŁName of the fix ŁCourse ŁLeg length  ŁIf appropriate, direction of tu rn if left turns are required ŁExpect further clearance time (i f you lose 2-way comm, the EFC  allows you to exit the holding pattern at a definite time  ŁPlan the last lap of the holding  patter to be at the fix as close as possible at the EFC time.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns ŒRECOMMENDED Entry ProceduresInstrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns -Entry Procedures Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns -Entry Procedures Note that outbound course falls into the direct sectorInstrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns -Entry Procedures Note that the outbound course falls into the teardrop (= tiny) sector.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns -Entry Procedures Note that the outbound course falls into the parallel sector.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Summary ChecklistŁA holding patter is a time delay used by ATC to help maintain separation and  smooth out the traffic flow.ŁYou may request a hold, for example, to wait for weather conditions to improve. ŁHolding pattern size is directly proportional to aircraft speed;doubling your speed  doubles the size of the holding pattern.ŁTurns are to the right in standard hol ding patterns, and to the left in nonstandard holding patters.ŁEach circuit of the holding pattern begins and ends at the holding fix. ŁAdjust the timing of you outbound leg to make your inbound leg one minute long. ŁTo correct for crosswind drift in the holding pattern, triple your inbound wind  correction angel on the outbound leg.ŁTo keep the volume of the protected airspace for a holding pattern within  reasonable limits, maximum holding airspeeds are designed according to altitude.ŁThe entry procedure for a holding pattern depends on your heading relative to the  holding course. The 3 recommended are direct, teardrop, and parallel.ŁA holding clearance should always contai n: holding direction, holding fix, and expect further clearance (EFC) time. If the holding pattern is not published, the clearance will also contain the holding course. For nonstandard patterns, left turns are specified. For patterns using DME, the clearance gives the outbound leg length in nautical miles.', ' PRELIMINARYPAGES Intentionallyleftblank A318/A319/A320/A321 FLIGHTCREWTRAINING MANUAL PRELIMINARYPAGES TABLEOFCONTENTS PLP.PRELIMINARYPAGES TABLEOFCONTENTS.................................... ................................................... ................1/2 LISTOFEFFECTIVESECTIONS/SUBSECTIONS................ ...............................................1/2 LISTOFEFFECTIVEOPERATIONSENGINEERINGBULLETINS...... .................................1/2 LISTOFEFFECTIVEFLIGHTCREWTRAININGBULLETINS......... ...................................1/2 AIRCRAFTALLOCATIONTABLE............................ ................................................... ........1/2 LISTOFMODIFICATIONS................................ ................................................... ...............1/2 IN.Introduction  OP.OperationalPhilosophy  NO.NormalOperations  AO.AbnormalOperations  SI.SupplementaryInformation  PIR.PreventingIdentifiedRisks FCAA318/A319/A320/A321FLEET PLP-TOC.P1/2 FCTM 08JUL08 A318/A319/A320/A321 FLIGHTCREWTRAINING MANUAL PRELIMINARYPAGES TABLEOFCONTENTS Intentionallyleftblank FCAA318/A319/A320/A321FLEET PLP-TOC.P2/2 FCTM 08JUL08 A318/A319/A320/A321 FLIGHTCREWTRAINING MANUAL PRELIMINARYPAGES LISTOFEFFECTIVESECTIONS/SUBSECTIONS M Localization SubsectionTitle Pages Rev.Date IN-010 GENERALINTRODUCTION 1/2to2/2 08JUL08 OP-010 INTRODUCTION 1/2to2/2 08JUL08 OP-020 FLIGHTCONTROLS 1/16to16/16 08JUL08 OP-030 AP/FD/ATHR 1/18to18/18 08JUL08 OP-040 ECAM 1/10to10/10 08JUL08 NO-010 GENERAL 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 NO-020 PRESTART 1/20to20/20 08JUL08 NO-030 START 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 NO-040 TAXI 1/10to10/10 08JUL08 NO-050 TAKEOFF 1/10to10/10 08JUL08 NO-060 CLIMB 1/6to6/6 08JUL08 NO-070 CRUISE 1/14to14/14 08JUL08 NO-080 DESCENT 1/8to8/8 08JUL08 NO-090 HOLDING 1/2to2/2 08JUL08 NO-100 APPROACHGENERAL 1/16to16/16 08JUL08 NO-110 ILSAPPROACH 1/6to6/6 08JUL08 NO-120 NONPRECISIONAPPROACH 1/10to10/10 08JUL08 NO-130 CIRCLINGAPPROACH 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 NO-140 VISUALAPPROACH 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 NO-150 PRECISIONAPPROACH 1/8to8/8 08JUL08 NO-160 LANDING 1/12to12/12 08JUL08 NO-170 GOAROUND 1/6to6/6 08JUL08 NO-180 TAXIIN 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 AO-010 GENERAL 1/6to6/6 08JUL08 AO-020 OPERATINGTECHNIQUES 1/16to16/16 08JUL08 AO-022 AUTOFLIGHT 1/2to2/2 08JUL08 AO-024 ELECTRICAL 1/2to2/2 08JUL08 AO-026 FIREPROTECTION 1/6to6/6 08JUL08 AO-027 FLIGHTCONTROLS 1/2to2/2 08JUL08 AO-028 FUEL 1/2to2/2 08JUL08 AO-029 HYDRAULIC 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 AO-032 LANDINGGEAR 1/2to2/2 08JUL08 AO-034 NAVIGATION 1/8to8/8 08JUL08 AO-070 POWERPLANT 1/2to2/2 08JUL08 AO-090 MISCELLANEOUS 1/6to6/6 08JUL08 SI-010 ADVERSEWEATHER 1/16to16/16 08JUL08 FCAA318/A319/A320/A321FLEET PLP-LESS.P1/2 FCTM 08JUL08 A318/A319/A320/A321 FLIGHTCREWTRAINING MANUAL PRELIMINARYPAGES LISTOFEFFECTIVESECTIONS/SUBSECTIONS M Localization SubsectionTitle Pages Rev.Date SI-020 FLYINGREFERENCE 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 SI-030 NAVIGATIONACCURACY 1/8to8/8 08JUL08 SI-040 ZFW-ZFCGENTRYERRORSZFW-  ZFCGENTRYERRORS 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 SI-060 TCAS 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 SI-070 USEOFRADAR 1/4to4/4 08JUL08 PIR-010 PREVENTINGIDENTIFIEDRISKS 1/6to6/6 08JUL08 FCAA318/A319/A320/A321FLEET PLP-LESS.P2/2 FCTM 08JUL08 A318/A319/A320/A321 FLIGHTCREWTRAINING MANUAL PRELIMINARYPAGES LISTOFEFFECTIVEOPERATIONSENGINEERINGBULLETIN M Identification T (1) E (2) Rev.Date Title (1)EcamImportanceType  (2)DocumentaryUnitImpactedbyEcam NoOperationsEngineeringBulletin FCAA318/A319/A320/A321FLEET PLP-LEOEB.P1/2 FCTM 08JUL08 A318/A319/A320/A321 FLIGHTCREWTRAINING MANUAL PRELIMINARYPAGES LISTOFEFFECTIVEOPERATIONSENGINEERINGBULLETIN Intentionallyleftblank FCAA318/A319/A320/A321FLEET PLP-LEOEB.P2/2 FCTM 08JUL08 A318/A319/A320/A321 FLIGHTCREWTRAINING MANUAL PRELIMINARYPAGES LISTOFEFFECTIVEFLIGHTCREWTRAININGBULLETIN M Identification Rev.Date Title NoFlightCrewTrainingBulletin FCAA318/A319/A320/A321FLEET PLP-LEFCTB.P1/2 FCTM 08JUL08 A318/A319/A320/A321 FLIGHTCREWTRAINING MANUAL PRELIMINARYPAGES LISTOFEFFECTIVEFLIGHTCREWTRAININGBULLETIN Intentionallyleftblank FCAA318/A319/A320/A321FLEET PLP-LEFCTB.P2/2 FCTM 08JUL08 A318/A319/A320/A321 FLIGHTCREWTRAINING MANUAL PRELIMINARYPAGES AIRCRAFTALLOCATIONTABLE Thistablegives,foreachdeliveredaircraft,thecrossrefere ncebetween: -TheManufacturingSerialNumber(MSN).  -TheFleetSerialNumber(FSN)oftheaircraftasknownbyAIRBU S S.A.S. -TheregistrationnumberoftheaircraftasknownbyAIRBUSS.A.S . -Theaircraftmodel.

Often,  performance monitoring will identify a need for  Boeing to assist in determining the solution to a  given in -service problem. However, with a good  understanding of the monitoring process and the  interactions among the variables involved, airlines  heir own problem  diagnosing and solving. Cruise performance monitoring has been used   for many years by airlines that strive to operate  their airplanes as ef˜ciently as possible.  These  airlines know that continuous cruise performance  monitoring of airplanes in their ˚eets can decrease  operating costs relative to airlines that do not   monitor airplane performance levels.  Continuous  cruise performance monitoring can give airlines  the information they need to:  A djust the baseline performance levels they  use for ˚ight planning and ˚ight management   computer (F MC ) fuel -required predictions   so that the correct amount of fuel is loaded   on each and every ˚ight.  I dentify normal deterioration for a ˚eet   of airplanes.  M atch the airplanes that perform best to   their longest routes.  I dentify high fuel burning airplanes for   possible maintenance.  Validate performance degradation for extended   twin -engine operations ( ETOP S) critical fuel  reserves planning (in lieu of the regulatory   requirement of 5  percent fuel mileage  deterioration allowance).  I ncrease ˚ight crew con˜dence in ˚ight plans  and possibly decrease the amount of  discretionary fuel requested and loaded. An additional, less recognized bene˜t of cruise  performance monitoring is diagnosing and solving  various airplane performance problems or issues.  These case studies show how cruise performance  monitoring was used to determine solutions to  three different problems. An airline that operates a 747 -400 airplane ˚eet  was concerned about what it considered to be   exce ssive fuel mileage deterioration relative to the  fuel mileage levels its airplanes exhibited when they   were new.  The airline requested help from both  Boeing and the engine manufacturer in dete rmining  what was causing this deterioration Š the   airframe, the engine, or both.  Through a better  understanding of the contributions that airframe  and engine deterioration make to the overall fuel  mileage deterioration, the airline could more  ef˜ciently focus its maintenance resources. To help resolve this issue, the airline proposed  an experiment involving an engine exchange  ˇ˙ ˛ :  Airframe versus engine Š   causes of fuel mileage deterioration ˇ˙ ˛ :  Airframe versus engine Š   causes of fuel mileage deterioration by Dave Anderson,  Flight Operations Engineer,  and Carolyn Hanreiter,  Aerodynamics Engineer 06 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 ﬁOLDﬂ 747-400 ﬁN EW ﬂ 747-400 TOTAL  FUEL MILEAGE  DIFF ERENCE 0.85%FROM OL D TO NE W AIRPLANE USING T HE OL D AN D NE W ENGINE Sbetween an old and a new airplane.  A six -year -old  747 -400, which was operating about 4.1  percent  below the ˚ight planning database level of fuel  mileage, represented the old airplane, while a  soon -to -be -delivered 747 -400 represented the  new one.  The airline requested assistance and  support from  Boeing and the engine manufacturer  in carrying out the experiment, which would:   M easure pre -exchange fuel mileage on both  the new and the old airplane (pre -engine swap).  Swap all four engines between the new and   old airplane.  M easure fuel mileage again on both the new  and the old airplane (post -engine swap). By using the same physical set of four engines  on two different airframes, the airline,  Boeing,   and the engine manufacturer agreed that any  measurable difference in fuel mileage for the same  set of engines on two different airframes could   be attributed to airframe effects alone Š that is,  drag deterioration. Boeing™s position was that proper maintenance  of the exterior of an airplane would lead to minimal  amounts of drag deterioration as an airplane ages.  As a result, the experiment began by putting the  old airplane through a complete D-check, including  a con˜guration inspection, so that it would be  considered as having a properly maintained  exterior before the engine swap.  Control surfaces  were rerigged, seals were repaired, and one engine  was replaced.  A minor leak in the pneumatic  system, discovered during the D-check, was not  ˜xed by the airline (determined to cause about a  0.1  percent penalty in fuel mileage). Fuel mileage  data was collected before and after the D-check to  determine any change across the check, especially  to quantify any changes resulting from rerigging  the ˚ight control surfaces and replacing any worn   seals. Fuel mileage improved 0.7  percent after the  D-check, with 0.3  percent attributed to proper  rerigging of the ˚ight controls and 0.4  percent  attributed to the changing of one engine. Fuel mileage data was then collected on   both the old and new airplanes before and   after the engine swap.  The data collected was   a combination of in -service data collected by   the airplane condition monitoring system ( ACM S)  and hand -recorded data that was collected under  more controlled test conditions. Average results from all four sets of data were  then compared to determine the differences in fuel  mileage between the old and new airplanes with  the same set of engines.  For both the old and new engines, the average  improvement in fuel mileage for the new airframe  relative to the old airframe was about 0.85  percent.  The initial conclusion could be that the older  airframe must contribute about 0.85  percent  toward the overall fuel mileage deterioration  originally observed on the old airplane and engine  combination. However, about 0.3  percent of that  difference is explainable.  Of the total calculated  difference of 0.85  percent, the pneumatic duct  leakage discovered on the old airplane during the   D-check contributed about 0.1  percent.  In addition,  the old airplane did not have the same revised   vertical ˜n fairing as the new 747 -400.  If the older  airplane had had the newer vertical ˜n fairing,   it is estimated that the fuel mileage would have   improved about 0.2  percent. After adjusting for the pneumatic system leak  and the newer vertical ˜n fairing, for the same set  of engines the old airplane™s fuel mileage averaged  about 0.5  percent worse than the new airplane.  The results are supportive of the position   that the drag deterioration of a well -maintained  airplane most likely will not exceed more than  about 0.5  percent. The experiment began by  putting the old airplane  through a complete  D-check, including a  conguration inspection.  07 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE NE W VERTICAL  FIN  FAIRING Œ 0.2% PNEUMATIC LEAKAGE Œ 0.1% ACTUAL UNEXPLAINABLE DIFF ERENCE = 0.55% Case Study 1:   To help determine the  primary cause of the fuel  mileage deterioration,  Boeing and the airline  collected fuel mileage data  on both a new and old  747-400 before and after  an engine exchange. An airline expressed concern to  Boeing that its  new 737 -800/ CFM56 -7B airplanes equipped with  Aviation  Partners  Boeing ( APB ) blended winglets  were exhibiting fuel mileage performance more than  2 percent worse than the  Boeing database level,  while its older, nonwinglet 737 -800s (all  approximately two years old) displayed fuel mileage  performance similar to the database level.  The  airline, which collects cruise fuel mileage data on an   ongoing basis, based its analysis on  ACM S-collected  cruise fuel mileage data analyzed using the  Boeing  Airplane  Performance  Monitoring ( APM ) program. In initial discussions between  Boeing and the  airline, it was explained that the database being used   by the airline to represent the 737 -800 with blended  winglets was based on the original winglet ˚ight test   results completed in early 2000.  This is the same  database used in the Flight  Crew  Operations  Manual,  the F MC , and the operational ˚ight planning  database.  Additional ˚ight tests had led to  Boeing™s  latest, best assessment of the delivered performance  of the winglets, which showed slightly less   improvement than the original testing.  This revised  database, based on several add itional ˚ight test  programs conducted in 2000 and 2001, includes a  different winglet drag increment (relative to a   nonwinglet 737 -800) and an aer oelastic correction  absent in the earlier database.  At  Mach  0.79, the difference between the two  databases varies from 0.2  percent to 2.3  percent,  depending on the exact conditions ˚own, with the  airline™s database predicting a better fuel mileage  increment because of the winglets in all cases.  Upon request, the airline provided  Boeing with  ACM S data for two of its 737 -800 airplanes with  blended winglets.  Boeing analyzed the data for  each airplane using both the operational database  and the revised database.  While the data was, on average, about  0.5  percent closer to the newer database level  than the operational database level,  Boeing™s  analysis did not agree with the airline™s analysis. Boeing™s analysis of the data using the revised  database concluded that two of the airplanes  appeared to display fuel mileage performance  about 3  percent below the latest  Boeing -assessed  winglet level Š even more than the 2  percent  originally suggested by the airline.  Further discussions with the airline revealed  that it had been using passenger weight allo wances  of 70 kg per passenger, including carry -on baggage,  and 13 kg per checked bag for all of its ˚ights.  As of June 1, 2002, the airline changed to the higher  passenger weight allowances recommended   in the Joint  Aviation  Requirements Œ  Operations  (J AR -OP S) 1.  Checked baggage would be weighed  whenever possible; otherwise, J AR -OP S 1 checked  baggage weight allowances would be used.  The  average passenger weight allowances are signi˜ -cantly higher than the 70 kg per passenger the   airline had been using.  Because the data sent   to  Boeing for the two winglet -equipped airplanes  was collected prior to June 2002, it was based   on the lighter weight allowance of 70 kg per  ˇ˙ ˛ :  Investigation of a cruise fuel  mileage shortfall ˇ˙ ˛ :  Investigation of a cruise fuel  mileage shortfall Boeing™s analysis of the  data using the revised  database concluded that  two of the airplanes  appeared to display fuel  mileage performance  about 3 percent below  the latest Boeing -assessed winglet   level Š even more than  the 2 percent originally  suggested by the airline.  08 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 passenger.  The airline™s analysis was based on  data using a combination of the weight allowances. As the investigation continued, the airline sent  additional data to  Boeing for the same two winglet -equipped airplanes Š but only for conditions  recorded after June 1, 2002, based on the higher  JAR -OP S weight allowances.  The airline also  included data for one more winglet -equipped  airplane, as well as for three nonwinglet airplanes.  The data for the two winglet -equipped airplanes  showed an immediate fuel mileage improvement   of about 2.4  percent for each airplane, based on  analyzing only the data from J AR -OP S weight  allowances collected after June 1, 2002.  This result  led quickly to the belief that the previous 70 kg per  passenger weight allowance was too light. Although both the fuel mileage and thrust  required changed signi˜cantly between data based  on 70 kg per passenger and data based on J AR -OP S passenger weight allowances, the thrust -speci˜c  fuel consumption ( TSF C) hardly changed.  Errors   in the estimated weight of an airplane present  themselves as high or low drag but do not affect the   fuel ˚ow (i.e.,  TSF C) deviations calculated by  APM .Although a signi˜cant improvement was  observed for both of the winglet -equipped airplanes  originally analyzed with data recorded before   June  1, 2002, the results for all six airplanes   were still not as good as what  Boeing experience  indicated for this model. Further investigation  determined that this airline operates its ˚eet of  737 -800s in a mix of both scheduled and holiday  charter ˚ights, using the speci˜c J AR -OP S weight  allowances called out for each.  The data sent to  Boeing for the six airplanes included a mixture of  data from both these types of ˚ights.  The average  passenger weight allowance recommended for  scheduled service is 84 kg per passenger and  76  kg per passenger for charter service (both are  higher than the 70 kg per passenger originally used   by the airline).  At  Boeing™s request, the airline  separated all of the post June 1, 2002, data into  two groups: charter service and scheduled service.   The data for each group was reanalyzed separately  (see ˜gs. 1 and 2).  The analysis revealed a signi˜cant discrepancy  in demonstrated fuel mileage and thrust -required  levels between the charter and scheduled ˚ights.   If airplane weight is underestimated, perceived  airplane performance will be poorer than expected.  Weight that is unaccounted for shows up as  increased airplane drag and decreased fuel   mileage.  In this analysis, the  TSF C deviations  remained consistent between both sets of data,  but the thrust -required (drag) deviations increased  signi˜cantly for the charter ˚ights Š a strong   indication of unaccounted -for airplane weight.  In this situation,  Boeing proposed that the  JAR -OP S passenger weight allowances as  recommended for holiday charter ˚ights were  underestimating the airplane weight for this particular  airline™s charter operations.  Although the airline  was receptive to the possibility that the J AR -OP S passenger weight allowances might be too light for its  holiday charter ˚ights, it was not fully convinced.  The  airline believed that the J AR -OP S weight allowances  for scheduled ˚ights could just as easily be incorrect,  in which case their airplanes were performing as  poorly as the charter ˚ight data indicated.  To determine which weight allowances were  correct, the airline and  Boeing agreed to collect  delivery ˚ight performance data on the airline™s   next new airplane delivery, a 737 -800 with  production blended winglets installed. The advantages of collecting delivery ˚ight   data as opposed to in -service data are:  T he performance level of the airplane could   be established at delivery.  T he airplane would be weighed at the  Boeing  factory with all the weight changes following  weighing but preceding delivery accurately  tracked and published in the Weight and  Balance  Manual.  Therefore, the delivery ˚ight  empty weight could be considered accurate.  Delivery ˚ights are ˚own with minimum crew,  so the issue of passenger weight allowances  would not exist. After collecting cruise performance data on   the delivery ˚ight, the airline would continue with  its standard in -service data collection on both  scheduled and charter ˚ights.  Comparing the  results from the delivery ˚ight with the results   obtained in -service would help determine which  JAR -OP S passenger weight allowances gave the  airline more accurate airplane gross weights.  If the  weight allowances were too heavy (the airplane was  actually lighter than estimated), then the in -service  performance would appear to be better than the   delivery ˚ight performance.  If the weight allowances  were too light (the airplane was heavier than   estimated), then the in -service performance would  appear to be worse than the delivery ˚ight level. The airline provided  Boeing with the ˜rst   10 weeks of  ACM S in -service data for the airplane  following delivery, separating the data for charter  ˚ights and scheduled -service ˚ights. For this  analysis, the data was analyzed relative to the   most recent 737 -800 with winglets database.  Although the delivery ˚ight results showed the  airplane to be slightly better than the demonstrated   database level, the early in -service charter ˚ight  results show the airplane with an average per -ceived fuel mileage 3.3  percent worse than the  demonstrated level (see ˜g. 3).  Unaccounted -for  weight shows up as airplane drag (thrust required).   According to the charter ˚ight data, the airplane  experienced a 4.4  percent increase in thrust  required on entering service, partially offset by a  0.7  percent drop in engine  TSF C, for a 3.6  percent  drop in fuel mileage from the delivery ˚ight level.   When the same ai rplane™s scheduled service data  for the same time period was analyzed, the fuel  mileage was much closer to the delivery ˚ight   level.  Average in -service fuel mileage for the ˜rst  10 weeks of operation deviated from the delivery   level by only 0.8  percent (only 0.5  percent below  the demonstrated level), which is within the  ACM S™s ability to determine fuel mileage over   a given time period. These results supported the conclusion that,  for this airline, the J AR -OP S passenger weight  allo wances for scheduled ˚ights more accurately  re˚ect the true weight of the passengers plus  carry -on baggage than the weight allowances  recommended for the charter ˚ights.  In addition, both are much more representative  than the original 70 kg per passenger the airline  had been using.  The weight allowances for  scheduled ˚ights of 84 kg per passenger produce  a more accurate zero fuel weight buildup and a  truer representation of the actual performance of  the airplane, with or without winglets. The results of this case study identi˜ed a  ˚eetwide airplane weight buildup issue for this   particular airline.  Boeing suggested that the  JAR -OP S holiday charter passenger weight  allowances appeared to be too light for this   airline™s operations, with unaccounted -for weight  showing up as excess airplane thrust required   (drag).  Using the J AR -OP S-recommended  passenger weight allowances for scheduled ˚ights,   the fuel mileage performance for its 737 -800s Š  with and without winglets Š is close to predicted  and re˚ects  Boeing expectations based on  numerous ˚ight tests and delivery ˚ight results. These results supported  the conclusion that, for  this airline, the JAR -OPS passenger weight allow -ances for scheduled  e accurately  rhe true weight   of the passengers plus   carry -on baggage.  09 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE AP 1 AP 2 AP 3 AP 4 AP 5 AP 6 CHARTER  S ER VI CE  DATA  ONLY JAR-OPS 1 PASSENGE R WEIGHT  ALLOWANCES  Figure 1 =Airplane with APB winglets   relative to winglet database = Nonwinglet relative to  nonwinglet database Percent Change Fuel MileageŒ2. 8%Œ2. 3%Œ2.8 %Œ1.1 %Œ1.4 %Œ1.7 %  GOOD Percent Change Thrust Required+2. 0%+2. 7%+2. 7%+0.2 %+1.3 %+0.7 %  GOOD Percent Change TSFC+0.9 %Œ0 .3 %+0.3 %+0.9 %+0.1 %+1.0 %  GOOD SCHED UL ED  S ER VI CE  DATA  ONLY  JAR-OPS 1 PASSENGE R WEIGHT  ALLOWANCES  Figure 2 =Airplane with APB winglets   relative to winglet database =Nonwinglet relative to  nonwinglet database Percent Change Fuel MileageŒ0 .3 %Œ0.1 %Œ1.0 %+0.8 %+0.3 %Œ0.1 %  GOOD Percent Change Thrust RequiredŒ0.4 %+0.5 %+0.9 %Œ1.4 %Œ0.1 %Œ0.7 %  GOOD Percent Change TSFC+0.8 %Œ0 .4 %Œ0 .2 %+0.1 %+0.7 %+0.8 %  GOOD PERFOR MANCE  SUMM AR Y DELIVE RY FLIGHT VE RSUS  IN-SE RVICE  (ALL  D EVIATI ONS  ARE  RELATIVE  TO  THE  WIN GLET  D ATABASE)  Figure 3 =Delivery ˜ight =Post delivery   charter service =Post delivery   schedule service Percent Change Fuel Mileage+0.3 %Œ3.3 %Œ0.5 %  GOOD Percent Change Thrust Required+0.3 %+3.0 %Œ1.4 %  GOOD Percent Change TSFC+0.3 %+0.4 %+1.1 %  GOOD 10 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 0.520.540.560.580.620.600.660.640.68GOODPercent Change Drag  (Œ)An airline requested assistance from  Boeing   to determine the airplane cruise performance  improvement resulting from the retro˜t installation  of blended winglets on 14 of its 737 -800s.  To determine the magnitude of this improvement,   cruise fuel mileage data collected after the installa -tion of the winglets would be compared to data   collected before the installation.  The airline provided  ACM S-recorded data collected on each of the   14 airplanes, before and after the installation of   the winglets, to  Boeing for analysis and comment. Retro˜tting the winglets is a two -step process  comprising a structural reinforcement of the wing   followed by installation of the winglet.  Eleven of the  airplanes had the wing reinforcement completed  many weeks before the winglets were installed,  with the airplanes returning to service with the  reinforced wings. For these 11 airplanes, the  nonwinglet data was based on this reinforced wing   con˜guration.  Three of the airplanes had the wing  reinforced and winglet installed at the same time.  For these three airplanes, the nonwinglet data was   based on the production nonreinforced wing.  The  two sets of data were analyzed separately in order  to identify any differences in the improvement  based on differences in the baseline before the  winglets were installed. Boeing analyzed the data for all 14 airplanes  using the same in -house software tools used to  analyze  Boeing ˚ight -test data.  These software tools  are different from the  APM  software provided to  airline customers, but the analysis produces basically  the same results.  The main difference is that the  Boeing in -house software normalizes the data  points to nominal weight to pressure ratios (W  ) chosen by  Boeing while the  APM  software does not.  The improvements were plotted versus W    in order to illustrate that the magnitude of the  improvement depends on W   for a given  Mach  number.  This dependency on W   is because the  winglet improvement is a function of airplane lift  coef˜cient, which in turn is a function of weight,   altitude, and speed.  The improvements were  determined by comparing both the nonwinglet   and winglet fuel mileage results to the nonwinglet  737-800 database.  The performance improvement  because of the winglet is not the average winglet  deviation from the nonwinglet database; rather, it  ˇ˙ ˛ :  Performance improvement resulting from  737 -800 winglet retrot ˇ˙ ˛ :  Performance improvement resulting from   737 -800 winglet retrot DRA G IM PRO VEMENT RE SUL TING  FRO M  RETROF ITT ING 737-800   AIRP LANES  WITH  APB  BLENDED  WINGL ET S Figure 4 W/Ÿ 106 lb = Winglet installation plus  wing reinforcement relative  to baseline wing (based on in-service cruise  fuel mileage measurements  of three retro˜t airplanes)  = Winglet installation relative  to reinforced wing (based on in-service cruise  fuel mileage measurements  of eleven retro˜t airplanes)  = Predicted drag  improvement  (based on Boeing  ˚ight-test results) Boeing™s analysis of the  data indicated a slight  improvement in drag and  ed  weight) that resulted  from the reinforcement  of the wing structure.  11 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE 0.520.540.560.580.620.600.660.640.68Percent Change Fuel Mileage (+) GOOD  = Winglet installation plus  wing reinforcement relative  to baseline wing (based on in-service cruise  fuel mileage measurements  of three retro˜t airplanes)  = Winglet installation relative  to reinforced wing (based on in-service cruise  fuel mileage measurements  of eleven retro˜t airplanes)  = Predicted fuel mileage  improvement  (based on Boeing  ˚ight-test results) is the difference between the average deviations  for the winglet and nonwinglet, both measured  relative to the nonwinglet database.  This same  process was followed for each W  , and for the  various sets of data (see ˜gs. 4 and 5). Boeing™s analysis of the data indicated a slight  improvement in drag and fuel mileage (at a ˜xed  weight) that resulted from the reinforcement of the   wing structure.  The results indicated this improve -ment to be relatively small but still worth an   average of a few tenths of a  percentage at normal  cruise weights and altitudes.  Including the effects  of both the wing strengthening and the addition of   the winglets, the fuel mileage and drag improve -ments closely matched their predicted levels. Because the improvement in drag is a func -tion of W   for a given cruise speed, the actual  improvement in fuel mileage that the airline would  experience for any given ˚ight conditions depends  on the W  s ˚own during that airline™s operations.  The change in total fuel required to ˚y a given  route is determined by a combination of the  improvement in fuel mileage offset by any increase   in airplane weight.  Retro˜tting the winglets to the  737 -800, including wing reinforcement, currently  adds about 218 kg to the empty weight of the  airplane, and this additional weight alone would   increase fuel burn approximately 0.2  percent to  0.3  percent for an average 737 -800 ˚ight leg. An analysis similar to the  Boeing analysis   could have been carried out by the airline itself  using the spreadsheet output option from the   APM  software program.  The results of analyzing  the data in this manner would differ by only a  relatively small amount from the analysis carried  out using the  Boeing in -house software.  This same  method of analysis could be used to investigate  any type of modi˜cation to an airplane. Data  collected before and after a modi˜cation would   be compared to a reference database and the  difference between the two sets of data would  re˚ect the effect of the modi˜cation.  The bene˜ts of cruise performance monitoring   are well known by many airlines that include   the practice as part of their toolbox of practices  aimed at ef˜cient operation of their airplanes.   The three case studies in this article illustrate   the use of cruise performance monitoring to solve  various cruise performance issues.  Performance  monitoring can also be used to identify ˚ight plan -ning and F MC  performance factors and to monitor  perfo rmance deterioration trends.  Boeing has the  resources to assist airlines with cruise performance  monitoring analyses and to help them interpret  results.

Because airline  maintenance operations represent a  t, airlines have asked  Boeing for help in reducing this cost.  Recent results show that changing   the way service bulletins are prepared  and delivered Š combined with airline  process improvements Š can reduce  maintenance cosy and  improve the ability to show  conformance. Boeing has continually made enhancements to the content, format, and  delivery of its service bulletins.  Past enhancements include digital delivery,  simpli˜ed  English, and tabular work instructions. Boeing has been working directly with airlines to reduce end -to -end costs  for service bulletin incorporation. During this process, it was observed that  when airlines create their engineering orders, they rewrite or reengineer  service bulletins and rekit or repackage the kit of parts to match their own  engineering orders.  This reengineering causes unnecessary delays and  expense for the airlines in implementing service bulletins.  Boeing developed the ﬁ Enhanced Service  Bulletin,ﬂ also known as the  ﬁNext  Generation Service  Bulletin,ﬂ to minimize this reengineering effort while  making it easier and less expensive to implement service bulletins.  The  enhanced service bulletin, in conjunction with airline process improvements,  will enable a smooth work˚ow ensuring that information, parts, and tools are  staged in a coordinated manner to support the mechanic during service  bulletin incorporation. Boeing™s enhanced service bulletins incorporate four key features: lean  work instructions, faster access to essential information, improved kit  packaging, and selective information extraction.  These features have been  incrementally introduced into  Boeing service bulletins as they became  available beginning in mid 2003.  Today,  Boeing develops all new service  bulletins to encompass all four features whenever possible.

Lean work  instructions One of the most apparent changes in the enhanced service bulletin is that  ˜gure instructions are provided in a work breakdown of four hours or fewer.  This makes it possible for airlines to schedule mechanics™ time more  ef˜ciently and reduces the coordination dif˜culties associated with work   shift changeover. Each ˜gure in the enhanced service bulletin is a single con˜guration.  Previously, multiple con˜gurations were typically shown in a ˜gure.  This  required the airline engineer, planner, or mechanic to extract the steps  applicable to the speci˜c airplane.  One con˜guration per ˜gure simpli˜es  extraction of the applicable data and can prevent accomplishment of the  wrong steps.  Additionally, separate left and right side ˜gures are now  provided, which further facilitates extraction of the applicable data.  03. Improved  kit packaging Enhanced service bulletin kits are packaged to match the ˜gure instructions.  If operators use the service bulletin instructions as written, this new packaging  eliminates additional repackaging or sorting through parts.  This change alone  can result in a signi˜cant time savings in both the operations and  maintenance arenas.  04.  Selective information  extraction Enhanced service bulletins enable airline personnel to extract information  speci˜c to selected airplane con˜gurations.  This allows an airline to more  quickly identify and extract service bulletin information speci˜c to its airplane  con˜guration.  Once the data is extracted, it can easily be copied into an  airline™s own document management system. 02. Faster access to  essential information When viewed online,  Boeing™s enhanced service bulletins include hotlinks  within their text that provide direct access to referenced documents, making it  easier and faster to ˜nd the information needed. For example, hotlinks provide   quick access to relevant information in the  Airplane  Maintenance  Manual  (AMM ), Structural  Repair  Manual (S RM ), and other documents available on   the Web portal  MyBoeingFleet.com. 14 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 ONE CON FIGURATION PER  FIGURE PRO VIDES DIRECT ACCE SS  TO APPLICABLE  DATA.

Boeing worked with airlines to validate the bene˜ts of the enhanced service  bulletin.  As part of that effort,  Boeing coordinated closely with one airline to  study the predicted bene˜ts of the enhanced service bulletin. Study data from  the airline showed these predicted bene˜ts:  A  potential 60  percent reduction in defects attributed to the rewriting or  reengineering of the service bulletin data into the airline™s document  management system.  A  potential 77  percent reduction in labor hours to develop and release the  service bulletin data into the airline™s document management system. Based on the positive results of the study data,  Boeing continued to work  closely with the same airline to collect actual labor hour bene˜ts.  The actual  data was obtained by comparing airline incorporation of a conventional ser -vice bulletin on part of its ˚eet and an enhanced version of the same service  bulletin on the remainder of its ˚eet. Data from the airline showed these  actual results:   A  reduction in nonrecurring engineering labor hours to develop the airline™s  own engineering and job cards from 143 labor hours to 87 labor hours.  A  reduction in recurring kit packaging labor hours from 24 hours to   6 hours per airplane. To date,  Boeing has issued more than 1,300 service bulletins across all  Boeing model airplanes with one or more of the four key features described  above.  Boeing has been working with a number of airlines to assist in the  adoption and implementation of enhanced service bulletins into their operations  as well as to obtain airline user feedback. Such feedback is key to adding  improvements to the enhanced service bulletins.  Boeing understands that each airline™s maintenance operation is unique and is  willing to work with individual airlines to ensure that each leverages all of the  bene˜ts possible from enhanced service bulletins and that the bulletins ˜t well  with existing airline operations.  Airlines may contact their  Boeing Field Service  Representative for assistance in adopting enhanced service bulletins.

As a result   of this approach, the basic 787 -8 airplane will have 30  percent  lower airframe maintenance costs than any comparable product  and will be available for revenue service more often than any  other commercial airplane. The  Boeing 787 program has consciously  designed in new, state -of -the -art features and  performance that reduce cost and increase  airplane availability.  These features will lead to  additional savings and greater revenue for  Boeing  customers.  The 787 re˚ects a new life -cycle  design philosophy that has dictated some  signi˜cant changes in the way the airplane will be   built.  These changes include extensive use of  composites in the airframe and primary structure,  an electric systems architecture, a reliable and  maintainable design, and an improved  maintenance program.  Taken together, these  changes will offer customers a guaranteed  reduction in maintenance costs.  The life -cycle cost approach to design looks at the  total cost picture for design options by examining  all of the factors that affect an airplane over its  lifetime.  Traditionally, the value of a given design  solution has been measured using factors such as:   Drag  Weight  N oise (cabin and community)  Schedule reliability  Development cost  B uild cost Using these measures to compare design  options helps determine the optimum choice. With the 787,  Boeing has expanded the life -cycle design approach by adding two unique  performance measures: maintenance cost and   airplane availability.  Clearly, looking at the cost to  maintain systems over their lifetimes becomes a  signi˜cant factor when attempting to understand   the total effect of a design decision on an operator™s  cost structure.  Airplane availability includes not  only schedule reliability but also other factors such   as the length of time an airplane must be out -of -service when maintenance is required.  Obviously,  taking an airplane out of service for two days has a  much bigger effect on operator revenue than  taking it out of service for two hours.  ˜˘ -ˇˇ ˜ ˇ˚ ˘ˆ ˘ ˜˚˚ ˜˘ -ˇˇ ˜ ˇ˚ ˘ˆ ˘ ˜˚˚ Boeing 787 from the  Ground  Upby Justin Hale,  787 Deputy Chief  Mechanic 18 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 Advanced CompositesAluminumTitaniumSteel (primarily landing gear) 50%Other20%15%5%10%The  Boeing 787 makes greater use of composite  materials in its airframe and primary structure than  any previous  Boeing commercial airplane.  Under -taking the design process without preconceived  ideas enabled  Boeing engineers to specify the  optimum material for speci˜c applications  throughout the airframe.  The result is an airframe comprising nearly   half carbon ˜ber reinforced plastic and other   composites.  This approach offers weight savings  on average of 20  percent compared to more  conventional aluminum designs. Selecting the optimum material for a speci˜c  application meant analyzing every area of the  airframe to determine the best material, given the  operating environment and loads that a component  experiences over the life of the airframe. For  example, aluminum is sensitive to tension loads but  handles compression very well.  On the other hand,  composites are not as ef˜cient in dealing with  compression loads but are excellent at handling   tension.  The expanded use of composites, especially  in the highly tension -loaded environment of the  fuselage, greatly reduces maintenance due to fatigue   when compared with an aluminum structure.  This  type of analysis has resulted in an increased use  of titanium as well. Where loading indicates metal  is a preferred material system but environmental  considerations indicate aluminum is a poor choice,   titanium is an excellent low -maintenance design  solution.  Titanium can withstand comparable loads  better than aluminum, has minimal fatigue con -cerns, and is highly resistant to corrosion.  Titanium  use has been expanded on the 787 to roughly   14  percent of the total airframe.  Every structural  element of the 787 has undergone this type of life -cycle analysis and material types are based on a  thorough and disciplined selection process.  ˇ˚˝˚˘ ˘ˆ  ˙˘˙ ˝ ˙ˆ  ˘ ˝˙ ˛ˇ˛ ˇ˚˝˚˘ ˘ˆ  ˙˘˙ ˝ ˙ˆ  ˘ ˝˙ ˛ˇ˛ HOW  CO MPO SI TE  S OLU TIONS  ARE   APP LI ED  THRO UG HO UT THE  787 In addition to using a robust structural design   in damage-prone areas, the 787 has been designed  with the capability to be repaired in exactly the   same manner that airlines would repair an airplane  today Š with bolted repairs. These can be just as  permanent and damage tolerant as they are on   a metal structure.  19 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE In addition to lowering the overall airplane  weight, moving to a composite primary structure  promises to reduce both the scheduled and  nonroutine maintenance burden on the airlines. Reduced scheduled maintenance.  Exper ience  with the  Boeing 777 proves that composite stru ctures  require less scheduled maintenance than noncom -posite structures. For example, the 777 composite  tail is 25  percent larger than the 767™s aluminum  tail, yet requires 35  percent fewer scheduled  maintenance labor hours.  This labor hour reduction  is due to the result of a reduced risk of corrosion  and fatigue of composites compared with metal. Reduced nonroutine maintenance.  A com -posite structure also results in less nonroutine   maintenance.  The 777 ˚oor structure is all  composite and highlights the advantages of   this material when applied in a harsh environ -ment.  Airline operators are aware of the fatigue  cracking and corrosion dif˜culties experienced  with traditional aluminum ˚oor beams.  The 777  model has been ˚ying for more than 10 years with  more than 565 airplanes in the ˚eet and to date  has not replaced a single composite ˚oor beam.  Boeing has also implemented a rigorous  process for evaluating the use of aluminum that  combines likelihood of corrosion with consequence   of corrosion.  This scoring system provides a  de˜nitive measure for establishing acceptable  application of aluminum in the design with full  understanding of the maintenance implications. Corrosion and fatigue in a structure add  signi˜cantly to the nonroutine maintenance burden   on an operator.  Nonroutine maintenance frequently  doubles or even triples the total labor hours  expended during a maintenance check. With   the expanded use of composites and titanium  combined with greater discipline in usage   of aluminum,  Boeing expects the 787 to have  much lower nonroutine labor costs than a more  conventional metallic airframe. In addition to using a robust structural design  in damage -prone areas, such as passenger and  cargo doors, the 787 has been designed from the  start with the capability to be repaired in exactly  the same manner that airlines would repair an  airplane today Š with bolted repairs.  The ability to  perform bolted repairs in composite structure is  service -proven on the 777 and offers comparable  repair times and skills as employed on metallic   airplanes. ( By design, bolted repairs in composite  structure can be permanent and damage tolerant,  just as they can be on a metal structure.) In addition, airlines have the option to perform  bonded composite repairs, which offer improved   aerodynamic and aesthetic ˜nish.  These repairs  are permanent, damage tolerant, and do not  require an autoclave. While a typical bonded   repair may require 24 or more hours of airplane   downtime,  Boeing has taken advantage of the  properties of composites to develop a new line of  maintenance repair capability that requires less  The right material for the   right application.  Without  preconceived ideas, Boeing  engineers were able   to specify the optimum  material for speci˜c  applications throughout   the airframe. 20 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 than an hour to apply.  This rapid composite repair  technique offers temporary repair capability to get  an airplane ˚ying again quickly, despite minor  damage that might ground an aluminum airplane.  In total, the reduced risk of corrosion and fatigue  associated with composites combined with the com -posite repair techniques described will lower overall  maintenance costs and maximize airline revenue by  keeping airplanes ˚ying as much as possible.  The  Boeing 787 re˚ects a completely new  approach to onboard systems. Virtually everything  that has traditionally been powered by bleed -air  from the engines has been transitioned to an  electric architecture.  The affected systems include:  E ngine start  A uxiliary power unit ( APU ) start  Wing ice protection  C abin pressurization  Hydraulic pumps The only remaining bleed system on the 787   is the anti -ice system for the engine inlets.  While much can be said regarding the ef˜ciency  gains achieved by changing the means of extracting  power for airplane systems from the engines, the  787™s no -bleed architecture brings with it some sig -ni˜cant maintenance cost and reliability advantages   as well.  By eliminating the pneumatic systems from  the airplane, the 787 will realize a notable reduction  in the mechanical complexity of airplane systems.  The list below highlights just a few of the compo -nents eliminated as a result of this systems change:  P neumatic engine and  APU  start motors  APU  load compressor   P recoolers  Various ducts, valves, and air control systems  L eak and overheat detection systems Auxiliary power unit.  The  APU  provides an  excellent illustration of the be ne˜ts of the more -electric architecture.  One of the primary functions  of a conventional  APU  is driving a large pneumatic  load compressor.  Replacing the pneumatic load  compressor with starter generators results in  signi˜cantly improved start reliability and power  availability.  The use of starter generators reduces  maintenance requirements and increases reliability  due to the simpler design and lower parts count.   In terms of in˚ight start reliability, the 787  APU   is expected to be approximately four times more   reliable than conventional  APU s with a pneumatic  load compressor. Electrical power generation.  Another funda -me ntal architectural change on the 787 is the use  of variable frequency electrical power and the  integration of the engine generator and starter  functions into a single unit.  This change enables  elimination of the constant speed drive (also known  as the integrated drive generator,  IDG), greatly  reducing the complexity of the generator.  In addi -tion, by using the engine generator as the starter  motor (an approach used with great success on the   Next -G eneration 737  APU ), the 787 has been able  to eliminate the pneumatic starter from the engine.  ˆ˚-˜,  ˝˚  ˜ˇ˘ˇ   ˝ ˙ˇ˘ˇ˛ ˆ˚-˜,  ˝˚  ˜ˇ˘ˇ   ˝ ˙ˇ˘ˇ˛ NO BLEED / MORE ELECTRICARCHITECTUREBLEE D-AIR  POWERE DThe transition from  bleed -air power to an  electric architecture  reduces the mechanical  complexity of the 787.

Brakes.  One innovative application of the more -electric systems architecture on the 787 is the  move from hydraulically actuated brakes to  electric.  Electric brakes signi˜cantly reduce the  mechanical complexity of the braking system and  eliminate the potential for delays associated with  leaking brake hydraulic ˚uid, leaking valves, and  other hydraulic failures.  Because its electric brake  systems are modular (four independent brake  actuators per wheel), the 787 will be able to  dispatch with one electric brake actuator ( EBA ) inoperative per wheel and will have signi˜cantly  reduced performance penalties compared with  dispatch of a hydraulic brake system with a failure  present.  The  EBA  is line -replaceable enabling  in-situ maintenance of the brakes.  In general, electric systems are much easier   to monitor for health and system status than  hydraulic or pneumatic systems; the brakes take   full advantage of this.  Continuous onboard  monitoring of the brakes provides airlines with a  number of advantages, such as:  Fault detection and isolation  E lectrical monitoring of brake wear  A bility to eliminate scheduled visual brake   wear inspections  E xtended parking times Because the 787 brakes can monitor the  braking force applied even while parked, the  electric brakes enable extended parking brake  times by monitoring and automatically adjusting   its parking brakes as the brakes cool. At an airplane level, the reduction in   systems parts by moving to a primarily electric   architecture is signi˜cant.  Overall, the 787 will  reduce mechanical systems complexity by more   than 50  percent compared to a 767; elimination   of pneumatic systems is a major contributor.   As a consequence of this reduction in complexity,  airlines will experience reduced airplane -level  maintenance costs and improved airplane -level  dispatch reliability. In fact, the move to electric systems is expected  to cut about a third of the schedule interrupts com -pared to a 767 for the systems affected by the  no -bleed/more -electric architecture.  Other bene˜ts  include improved health monitoring, greater fault   tolerance, and better potential for future tech -nology improvements. In addition to major changes such as use of com -posites and the elimination of pneumatic systems,  the 787 takes advantage of new technologies to  increase reliability and improve maintainability.  Boeing has looked for opportunities large and  small to reduce maintenance costs while making  the 787 highly available for revenue service. Here are some wide -ranging examples that  illustrate the extent of these improvements. Advanced maintainability analysis.  A new  generation of digital analysis tools is enabling   Boeing to better understand future maintenance  issues during the design process.

Boeing has already identi˜ed about  4,000 areas of maintenance on the airplane   and will both digitally and physically validate   100  percent of 787 maintenance procedures   prior to entry into service ( EI S). Advanced maintenance computing  systems.  The 787 features greatly expanded and  improved systems monitoring capability coupled  with an advanced onboard maintenance computing  system.  This capability combined with e -enabling  technologies, which make real -time ground -based  monitoring possible, will signi˜cantly aid in rapid,   accurate troubleshooting of the 787.  Airplane  systems information used in conjunction with fully  integrated support products will help maintenance  and engineering organizations quickly isolate    failed components and reduce return -to -service  times.  Boeing expects the 787 to show a reduction  in no -fault -found ( NFF) removals of 58  percent  compared to the 767, reducing yet another major  cost driver for 787 operators. Selective paint stripping.  Boeing is pioneering a  new paint stripping technique that makes it possible  to chemically strip the paint on the airplane™s   composite airframe.  A three -hour chemical strip  removes decorative paint.  This eliminates the  hand -sanding requirement for paint removal on  composite structure and puts the 787 on par with  a metal airplane in terms of repaint times. Electro -chromatic dimmable windows.   The 787 replaces mechanical window shades   with highly reliable electro -chromatic dimmable  windows with a projected life of more than  20  years.  In addition to eliminating the  maintenance associated with light -leaking or  inoperable window shades, electro -chromatic  dimmable windows give cabin crews the ability to  dim or brighten an entire cabin at the press of a  single button.  Propulsion structure and airplane interface.   The 787 marks the ˜rst time  Boeing has made the  engine type interchangeable at the wings.  That  allows a 787 owner to quickly and easily convert  an airplane to a different engine brand in order to  place it into a ˚eet.  The 787 engine cowlings have  a quick composite repair capability, enabling small  damages to be repaired in one hour at the gate,  maximizing the airplane™s availability. High -intensity discharge (HID) and light  emitting diode (LED) lighting.  The 787  has replaced virtually all cabin, ˚ight deck and   exterior lighting with H ID and  LE D lighting technolo -gies.  Because these light types have no ˜lament,  the operational life of the lights is dramatically  longer than that of an incandescent bulb. For  example, H ID landing lights will last an order of  ELECTRO-CHRO MAT IC DIMM AB LE W IN DOW S:Eliminated mechanical window shades  High reliability Œ 70,000 cycles / 20 years  Operational temperature range  -40 C Œ +60 C Installed between the dust cover and outside window  Easily replaced by removing window reveal 23 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE CUMUL AT IV E MAIN TE NANCE -PLANNING   DATA  ( MPD)   DOC UM ENT LABO R HOU RS  OVE R 25  YEA RS767-300 ER 787-8 ACHECK44 %re ducti onCCHECK65%re du cti onDCHECK/HMV63%reducti onmagnitude longer than the lights in service today.  LE D cabin lights will last 50,000 operational hours  and  LE D aircraft position lights 20,000 operational  hours.  Overall, 787 lights will last ten to twenty  times longer than their in -service counterparts.  Improved dispatch reliability.  In the 787,  Boeing is demonstrating that generational  improvements in systems technology result in   airplane -wide reliability improvements.  At an  airplane level, component reliability is improved by   more than 15  percent when compared to the 767.  That translates into improved schedule reliability.  The 787 program is targeting a mature schedule  reliability of more than 99  percent. By working closely with airlines, major partners  and suppliers, and regulatory agencies,  Boeing  plans to deliver a scheduled maintenance program  approved by the  U.S. Federal  Aviation  Administra -tion and  European  Aviation Safety  Agency before  taking the 787 into ˚ight testing.  The 787 program  has set target intervals for  EI S that exceed those of  any other commercial airplane.  These target  intervals include a ˜rst external visual inspection of  the structure at 6 years and the ˜rst internal visual  inspection of the structure (heavy check) at 12   years.  The 787 maintenance program is on track  to deliver the target intervals at  EI S.  In addition to longer intervals between  scheduled maintenance checks, the 787 program  projects labor hours content will be reduced by   20  percent on a per -check basis and total scheduled  labor hours will be reduced by 60  percent over the  life of the airplane.  This reduction in required scheduled  maintenance is another signi˜cant contributor   to the overall 30  percent airframe and systems  maintenance cost reduction guaranteed by the 787. By designing the 787 with features and  performance that reduce cost and increase   airplane availability,  Boeing is developing an  airplane that promises to offer  Boeing customers  signi˜cant savings and greater revenue.

These improvements optimize the content and interval of maintenance   tasks to maintain safety and reliability and achieve cos Improvements are based on Boeing analysis of in -service data collected from  the wort. All improvements are reviewed and approved through   an industry process involving Boeing, operators, and regulatory agencies. Over the decades,  Boeing has worked closely with the aviation industry to  develop robust processes that ensure scheduled maintenance programs  adhere to the highest safety and operational reliability levels.  In creating   and updating its scheduled maintenance programs,  Boeing uses a process   as outlined in Federal  Aviation  Administration  Advisory  Circular 121 -22 A (Maintenance  Review  Board  Procedures) that involves the establishment of   an  Industry Steering  Committee ( ISC), in -service data collection and analysis,  and a recommendation from  Boeing for each individual task under review. An  ISC comprises operators, manufacturers, and regulators who follow the  guidance outlined in  Advisory  Circular  AC  121-22 A to develop the scheduled  maintenance program for an airplane model and the resulting  Maintenance  Review  Board  Report ( MRBR ).  It is the function of the  ISC, under the direction  of a chairperson (an operator selected by its peer operators), to develop and   establish policy for the development of the  MRBR  proposal and participate in  the review and approval process of the  ISC.  ISC meetings for all models, which are held on an as -needed basis, take  place in Seattle, Wash., or  Long  Beach,  Calif., and generally last one week.  Meetings are open to all operators and typically cover a speci˜c  Boeing  airplane model or de˜ned set of models.  The airframe manufacturer serves as an  ISC co -chairperson and has   the duties of receiving in -service data to be analyzed for proposed  MRBR  changes, providing the  ISC with suf˜cient technical data to base decisions   on proposed changes, providing relevant training to the  ISC as needed, and  coordinating and participating in  ISC and working group activities.  The Federal  Aviation  Agency (F AA ) and  European  Aviation Safety  Agency  (EA SA) have  Maintenance  Review  Board ( MRB ) chairperson duties, which  consist of inviting other regulatory authorities, in coordination with the  manufacturer, to participate in the  MRB  process; reviewing and accepting   or rejecting the policy and procedures used throughout the process; and  providing ˜nal acceptance of the  MRBR .  The  ISC makes ongoing improvements to the scheduled maintenance  program using the most current maintenance philosophy (see ﬁHistory of  Main -tenanceﬂ on p. 28).  These improvements not only maintain the inherent safety  and reliability of the airplane but can also produce substantial savings for the  operators.  Any operator may become a representative voting member of an  ISC.  Operators strongly in˚uence the success of a scheduled maintenance  program revision by providing in -service data.  Boeing analyzes the ˚eetwide  data provided by the operators to identify important trends for incorporation   into the scheduled maintenance programs through the  ISC process.  The operators and  Boeing work together to identify areas within the  scheduled maintenance program to review for optimization.  In-service data   is collected by the operators and sent to  Boeing for review and analysis. For  each identi˜ed maintenance task,  Boeing reviews the data and analyzes the  positive and negative in -service results.  Boeing also reviews service bulletins,  reliability data, service letters, airworthiness directives and any other pertinent   documents, and coordinates proposed changes with other  Boeing or supplier  engineering groups.  Once the analysis is complete,  Boeing makes a recommendation for each  individual task under review and presents it to the  ISC- participating operators  and the regulatory agencies.  Each operator is entitled to one vote on the  Boeing proposal.  The entire process is observed by the regulatory agencies,  which ultimately can approve or reject any proposed changes.  Accepted  changes are incorporated into the  MRBR , requiring acceptance from the  MRB  chairperson (the F AA  and  EA SA).  The changes are also incorporated into the  Boeing  Maintenance  Planning Data ( MP D) document and  Boeing -con˜gured  task cards, which are issued to the operators for inclusion in their own  scheduled maintenance programs. The  ISC process (see ˜g. 1) ensures that operators have ef˜cient scheduled  maintenance programs with the highest possible levels of safety and reliability.  The combination of operators™ experience and  Boeing™s design -based analysis  ensures that all safety items on the airplane are supported by scheduled   maintenance tasks with appropriate intervals.  The result is increased reliability  with decreased labor hours and maint enance costs (see ˜g. 2).  Boeing  engineering design groups can develop resolutions to technical issues arising   from the in -service data.  The new design or process changes can improve  reliability and result in maintenance cost avoidance for the entire ˚eet. ˘ˆ˛  ˘ˆ  ˇ˚˝˝ ˘ ˘ˆ˛  ˘ˆ  ˇ˚˝˝ ˘ ˘ˆ-˘ˇ ˙˙ ˇ˚ ˜˜ ˇ˘˚ˆ ˙ˆ ˙ˆ˙ ˜˘ ˘ˆ-˘ˇ ˙˙ ˇ˚ ˜˜ ˇ˘˚ˆ ˙ˆ ˙ˆ˙ ˜˘ 26 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 INDUS TR Y  STEER ING   CO MMI TTEE  PROCE SS Figure 1 INDUSTRY  S TEERIN G COMMITTEE Boeing /  Airlines / F AA  /  EA SA Review Data  for  Acceptance MRBR  Acceptance   by FAA  /  EA SABoeing  MP DIssuance   Generated Incorporation in  Operator  Maintenance Program Boeing  Recommendation to  ISCData  Analysis by  Boeing In-Service  Airline Maintenance  Data  Collection Engineering Enhancements In-Service Operators 27 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE 777  TECH NI CA L DIS PATCH  RE LI AB ILI TY AND S CHED UL ED  MAIN TE NANCE   LABOR  HO URS Figure 2 Reduction in scheduled  maintenance cost has had  no adverse effect on tech -nical dispatch reliability. 2,5500™96™01™06100%97.9%         =Scheduled Maintenance Labor Hours per 10,000  Flight Hours =777 TechnicalDispatch ReliabilityA recent evaluation of the scheduled maintenance program for the 777  illustrates the  ISC process.  This evaluation included a review of approximately  400 777 maintenance tasks.  The new program extends the maintenance inspection interval for zonal and  structural tasks, involving such areas as doors, fuselage compartments, struts,  and ˚ight controls, from 25 to 37 months.  Under the previous  MRBR , an airplane  was pulled out of service for approximately 5 days to perform required mainte -nance checks every 25 months.  The addition of 12 months to this maintenance  interval provides signi˜cant ˜nancial and scheduling opportunities to 777 opera -tors.  Other tasks that have been escalated in the new maintenance program  include many general inspections, which have increased from 100 to 125 days. The result saves more than 400 labor -hours per airplane per year and  increases airplane availability by providing airlines with one additional day of   revenue operation annually for each 777 in their ˚eet.  Using industry averages,  the reduced maintenance costs and increased revenue opportunities added   more than $100,000  USD in annual value to each 777 in operation.  In total, the evaluation resulted in an escalation (i.e., lengthening of   the interval between maintenance task accomplishment) of approximately   100 line maintenance phase check tasks (similar in content to the block  program  A- check) and approximately 250 hangar -level -check tasks (similar   in content to the block program  C- check).  The  ISC, however, did not escalate  approximately 12  percent of the tasks reviewed and de -escalated (i.e., short -ened the interval between maintenance task accomplishment) one task based  on the ˜ndings from the in -service data.  For example, one task that was escalated on the 777 was ﬁoperationally  check ˚ight deck indicator lights in dim and bright mode,ﬂ which is considered  an economic, not a safety, task.  Operators provided 1,500 test results for this  task with no adverse ˜ndings, and the  ISC determined that the interval for   this task could be extended from 1,200 to 1,500 ˚ight hours.  As with the  other tasks that were escalated, this change enables operators to arrange their  maintenance programs in a more ef˜cient manner without compromising safety. Boeing continues to seek optimization of its maintenance requirements using  improved data collection and the  ISC processes.  Boeing is currently developing  a program that collects and stores real -time in -service data from scheduled  maintenance visits in a line and hangar environment and ass ociates this   data with the scheduled maintenance task.  The program enables data to be  gathered and analyzed centrally for use by the industry in adjusting current  scheduled maintenance tasks or check intervals based on in -service ˜ndings. This will allow  ISCs to be more proactive in managing scheduled maintenance  programs.  It also will allow operators to benchmark against other participating  operators, expedite ground times for line and hangar maintenance visits, and plan  spares and consumables using worldwide averages for scheduled maintenance. The  ISC process maintains safety and reliability standards and reduces waste  by ensuring maintenance tasks are performed at the proper level of intensity  and interval, based on industry in -service ˚ight data and each airplane  model™s inherent design characteristics. Data collection and operator participation in the  ISC process remain key  factors in future scheduled maintenance program improvements.

The  programs were simple and without analytical  basis.  The formation of airlines created the need  for new regulations and broader regulatory  involvement in maintenance requirements. With the entry of large jet airplanes into the  commercial market in the 1950s, the airplane  manufacturer became the source of maintenance  program development.  The underlying concept was  to overhaul every component at a given time. In 1960, the industry formed a task force to  investigate the capabilities of preventive main -tenance.  The ˜ndings of the task force led to a  new type of maintenance called ﬁon -conditionﬂ  maintenance. The handbook ﬁ Maintenance  Evaluation   and  Program Development,ﬂ also referred to as  ﬁMSG- 1,ﬂ was developed in 1968 for the 747 by  the  Air  Transport  Association ( ATA )  Maintenance  Steering  Group ( MSG), a group of airframe  manufacturers, airlines,  U.S. Federal  Aviation  Administration (F AA ) repr esentatives, and  suppliers.  MSG- 1 used decision logic to develop  scheduled maintenance.  For aircraft in the 1970s, the document  ﬁAirline/ Manufacturer  Maintenance  Program  Planning,ﬂ or ﬁ MSG- 2,ﬂ was developed.  It was  process oriented and analyzed failure modes   from the part level up.  The  MSG- 2 philosophy   was based on the theory that all airplanes and  their components reach a period when they should  be ﬁzero timedﬂ or ﬁoverhauledﬂ and restored to  new condition.  In 1978,  United  Airlines, commissioned by the  Department of Defense, developed a methodology  for designing maintenance programs based on   tested and proven airline practices.  This new  methodology was the basis for  MSG- 3, the current  industry standard.  This methodology has a task -oriented  approach to maintenance that analyzes system  failure modes from a system level, or top down.  Maintenance tasks are performed for safety, oper -ational, or economic reasons.  They involve both  preventive maintenance and failure ˜nding tasks.  Revisions to the  MSG- 3 philosophy have  provided added methodology for improving  coverage of all modes of failure, such as inclusion  of the  Corrosion  Prevention and  Control  Program,  Enhanced  Zonal  Analysis, and  Lightning/High  Intensity  Radiated Fields.  Boeing continues to work with airplane  operators, regulators, and the  ATA  to update   MSG- 3 to enhance the methodology.  history of  maintenance11.25\" Bleed 8.75\" Bleed 11\" Trim 8.5\" Trim Scale: 1.0\" = 1\" 10.5\" Live 8\" Live Date:6/20/06le Name: BOEG_BCAG_787_4453M_MOutput printed at: 100%Fonts:Helvetica (Bold), Helvetica (Plain), Agenda Light Media:Aero Boeing Space/Color: Live:8 in. x 10.5 in.

Celestial navigation will now be a way of life for you.  The phe-  nomenal accuracy of GPS, along with the KLN 89(B)Õs user-friendly operation and graphics display will make flying a delight.  Not only will the KLN 89(B) help you to navigate more easily and more accurately, its trip planning features, air data calculations, and other useful fea- tures will make you feel like youÕre flying with a true flight management system.In addition, KLN 89B may be IFR approved for En route, Terminal,and Non-precision Approach operations.  We think youÕll find that  having an abundance of navigational data (not to mention a moving map!) available to you will make non-precision approaches more pre- cise and more enjoyable.This Pilot\\'s Guide will be of great help to you.  It is written in plain, simple English and it assumes you are not an experienced user of GPS or other type of long range navigation equipment.  If you are  experienced, so much the better.  This Pilot\\'s Guide also includes  hundreds of sample screen figures and other illustrations to make your learning easier.  It is designed so that you can start at the front  and progress in the order presented; however, you may want to skip around and learn things in your own order.  Also, on page iv, there is  an index of frequently used procedures which will help you find the page that describes how to do exactly what you want to do.  There  are also several appendices in the back of the manual that you may find useful from time to time.Be sure to keep this Pilot\\'s Guide handy with you in the airplane.  It is designed to fit easily in the glove box, or in the seat pocket.  The KLN  89(B) is very simple to operate, but the Pilot\\'s Guide can sure be of help to you.One last thing.  Don\\'t get so involved in learning to use the KLN 89(B)that you forget to fly the airplane. Be careful, and remember to keep a close eye out for other aircraft.KLN 89(B) SNEAK PREVIEWIf you absolutely canÕt wait to use your KLN 89(B) until youÕve readthis PilotÕs Guide, this section is for you.  This page will teach you just  enough to get going and then learn by doing.  This operational pre-  view assumes the KLN 89(B) has been properly installed, the unit  was previously operational in the same general geographical loca-  tion, and that no peripheral equipment interfaced with the KLN 89(B) (such as external HSIs, CDIs, autopilots, moving map display, etc.) is to be used at this time.  If you are using this operational preview in  flight, do so only in good VFR conditions and only with an alternate means of navigation (including pilotage) available to cross-check position.1.Turn the unit on with the On/Off knob (the small knob in lower left hand corner).2.For a few seconds, the Power On Page is displayed while the unit runs a self-test. Afterwards, the Self-test Page is displayed. If the KLN 89(B) is receiving an altitude from an encoding altime- ter, the present indicated altitude will be displayed on line 2. The bottom line should display Passand a flashing Ok?. Press thebutton to approve the Self-test Page.3.The Initialization Page will now be displayed.  If the date and time are incorrect by more than 10 minutes, refer to section 3.2 of this PilotÕs Guide. The right side of the screen should show the identi- fier of the nearest airport to the initial position, along with a radial and distance from that airport waypoint. Press  with the cur-sor flashing over Ok?to approve the Initialization Page.4.If you are using a KLN 89, or your KLN 89B has been configured for VFR use only, the VFR page will now be displayed to notify you of the VFR limitation. Press to approve this page.5.The Data Base Page is now displayed showing the date the data base expires or the date it expired.  Press  to acknowledgethe information displayed on this page.IntroductioniiKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideIntroduction iii6.The next page displayed will probably be a page showing the VHF communication frequencies for the airport you are at. For now, use the right outer knob to turn to the NAV page type (watch the lower left corner of the screen and the small bar at the bottom to know when you are there). Then use the right inner knob to select the NAV 2 page if not already there. The NAV 2 page shows your present position relative to a nearby VOR. Verify that this position is correct before proceeding.7.Press the  button.  A page with the words  DIRECT TOis nowdisplayed on the screen.In step 8 you will enter the ICAO identifier of the airport.  The identifi- er will have a ÒKÓ prefix for a Continental U.S. airport, a ÒCÓ prefix for  a Canadian airport, or a ÒPÓ prefix (in some cases) for an Alaskan air- port if the identifier is all letters.  For example, LAX becomes KLAX.  For these countries if the identifier contains any numbers, there is no prefix.  For example, TX04 is entered TX04.  For other areas of the  world the airport identifier should be entered identically to how it is charted.8.Rotate the right inner knob until the first character of the airport identifier is displayed. Turn the right outer knob one step clock- wise to move the flashing segment to the second character position. Rotate the right inner knob to select the second charac- ter of the identifier. Use this procedure to enter the complete airport identifier.9.Press  .  The display will change to a page showing the identi- fier, name, city, and state/country of the airport just entered. Confirm that the correct airport is displayed. Press  a secondtime to approve the airport data.10.A Navigation page (specifically the NAV 1 page) is now on the screen. It displays the desired ground track, actual ground track, bearing, and ETE to the destination airport. In addition, it displays a course deviation indicator (CDI).SeeÑwasnÕt that easy?IntroductionivHOW-TO INDEX This index will help you quickly find important procedures at a glance.The list is

KLN 89(B) SYSTEM COMPONENTSA basic KLN 89(B) system consists of a panel mounted KLN 89(B)GPS and a KA 92 GPS antenna.  An altitude input is required to  obtain full navigation and operational capabilities. Additional system components may be added or interfaced to the KLN 89(B) which increase its features and capabilities.  Some of these optional compo- nents include an external course deviation indicator (CDI) or horizontal situation indicator (HSI), autopilot, and external annuncia- tors. Typically, an altitude input, an external indicator, and external annunciators are required for IFR approach certification.The KLN 89(B) panel mounted unit contains the GPS sensor, thenavigation computer, a Gas Plasma Discharge Display, and all con- trols required to operate the unit.  It also includes the data base card  which slides into the left side of the front panel.The KA 92 GPS ÒpatchÓ antenna is available for use with the KLN89(B). It is designed to always be mounted on the top of the aircraft.The KLN 89(B) has analog outputs to drive the left-right deviation barof most mechanical CDIs and HSIs. In addition, the NAV mode of the Bendix/King KFC 150, KAP 150, KAP 150H, KAP 100, KFC 200, KAP 200, KFC 250, KFC 275, KFC 300, and KFC 325 flight control systems may be coupled to the KLN 89(B). Many other autopilots may also be coupled to the KLN 89(B). Actual autopilot performance and capability when coupled to the KLN 89(B) may vary significantly from one autopilot model to another.Altitude may be provided to the KLN 89(B) from an encoding altime- ter or blind encoder. Altitude is used as an aid in position  determination when not enough satellites are in view. All IFR installations require remote annunciators to be mounted in theaircraft panel in order to select and indicate the status of certain KLN 89(B) functions.  En route and terminal IFR certifications require  annunciators for message (MSG) and waypoint alert (WPT).  Non-  precision approach certifications also require a switch/annunciator to select and display when the approach mode is armed or active.Each KLN 89(B) system includes a configuration module which isattached to the KLN 89(B) mounting rack.  The module allows the  KLN 89(B) to be configured for the unique characteristics of your equipment installation.  Parameters that are set by the configuration  module include:¥àWhether the KLN 89B may be used for IFR operations or not,and if it may be used for non-precision approach IFR operations.  KLN 89 may only be used for VFR navigation.¥Whether or not the altitude alert function in enabled.  See section 4.3.¥Whether or not an external fuel management system is interfaced to the KLN 89(B).  See section 4.8.¥Whether or not an external air data computer is interfaced to the KLN 89(B).  See section 4.9.¥The conditions for the aircraft bus voltage alert to activate.  See section 3.16.The configuration information is stored both in the module and in theKLN 89(B) internal memory.  If the KLN 89(B) detects a difference  between the configuration stored in the module and the configuration stored in the internal memory (which should only occur following the exchange of KLN 89 or KLN 89B units), the configuration information will automatically be updated to the configuration specified in the configuration module.If an error is detected in the configuration data, a warning pagestating Configuration Mem Errorwill be displayed during theKLN 89(B) start-up sequence, and the configuration memory will be set to arbitrary default values.  See an authorized Honeywell Service  center to correct the configuration memory error.System Components1-2System ComponentsChapter 1KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideSystem Components 1-3System ComponentsChapter 1This page intentionally left blank Data BaseData BaseChapter 22-0CANADAUSALATIN AM PACIFIC SOUTH PAC SOUTH AMEUROPEEAST EURMID EASTAFRICASOUTH PAC PACIFIC 756045301501530456075604530150153045601651501351201059075604530150153045607590105120135150165180Pacific Data Basecoverage areaOverlap in Pacific & Atlantic  Data Base coverage areasAtlantic Data Base coverage areaAmericas North Data Base coverage areaAmericas South Data Base coverage areaOverlap in Americas North & Americas  South Data Base coverage areasFigure 2-1 KLN 89(B) Data Base Geographical RegionKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideData Base 2-1Data BaseChapter 22.  DATA BASE 2.1. DATA BASICS The data base provides two primary functions.  First, it makes pilot interface with the GPS sensor much easier.  Rather than having to  manually look up and then enter the latitude and longitude for a spe- cific waypoint, it allows you to merely enter a simple waypoint identifier.  The data base automatically looks up and displays the lati-  tude and longitude associated with the identifier.  It should be obvious that the data base saves a lot of tedious latitude/longitude entry and also greatly reduces the potential for data input mistakes.The second function of the data base is that it serves as a very con-venient means to store and easily access aeronautical information. Want to know the name of the airport, the nearest city, or the airport  elevation?  Just unleash the power of the KLN 89(B) and display the  information right on the screen.àThirdly, the KLN 89B data base stores non-precision approaches intheir proper sequence.  This allows you to select an approach as a  whole, rather than entering the approach waypoint by waypoint.2.2. DATA BASE CONTENTS AND COVERAGE AREAS There are four data base coverage areas available for the KLN 89(B). They are referred to as the ÒAmericas NorthÓ data base, the  ÒAmericas SouthÓ data base, the ÒAtlanticÓ data base, and the ÒPacificÓ data base.The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and AeronauticalRadio, Inc. (ARINC) break the world into the ten geographic regions shown in figure 2-1.  The KLN 89(B) Americas North data base con-  tains aeronautical information for the group of ICAO regions consisting of Canada, USA and Latin America. The KLN 89(B) Americas South data base contains aeronautical information for the group of ICAO regions consisting of USA, Latin America and South America. The KLN 89(B) Atlantic data base provides information for the ICAO regions Europe, Africa, East Europe, and Mid East. Likewise, the Pacific data base contains information for East Europe, Mid East, Pacific, and South Pacific.Data Base2-2Data BaseChapter 2The following is a listing of the KLN 89(B) data base contents:AIRPORTS Identifier Name City, State or Country Use type (if heliports, military, or private) Latitude and Longitude Elevation Runway numbers, lengths, surfaces, and lighting Fuel availability Approach types available (precision, non-precision, or none) Radar approach/departure environment Time difference relative to UTC.

ICAO IDENTIFIERS Waypoints are stored in the KLN 89(B) database almost exclusivelyby their ICAO identifiers. ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) is an internationally accepted reference for the data.  In  almost all cases the proper ICAO identifiers may be taken directly from Jeppesen-Sanderson or NOS aeronautical charts.Airport identifiers in the contiguous United States, Alaska, andCanada are special cases in the ICAO system.  Many airport identi-  fiers for these areas have four letters beginning with a prefix letter that corresponds to the geographic area in which it is located.  The  prefix letter for the contiguous U.S. is ÒKÓ.  Thus, the identifier for  Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is KDFW, not DFW (which would be identical to the VOR identifier).  Likewise, the identifier for  Orlando Executive Airport is KORL while the VOR identifier is ORL. The prefix letter for Canada is ÒCÓ and for Alaska is ÒPÓ.NOTE: There are several exceptions in Alaska.  In many cases, air- ports with three letter identifiers receive the prefix ÒPÓ, but there are many that donÕt.  The most reliable method of determining an Alaska  airport identifier is to look it up from the airport name or city.  See sec- tion 3.7.4, ÒSelecting Waypoints by Name or CityÓ.Incidentally, you can program the KLN 89(B) to default to a certain letter (such as ÒKÓ) when you are entering a waypoint identifier. See section 3.4.2, ÒData EntryÓ to learn about this handy feature.Not all airport identifiers receive the prefix letter.  Airport identifiers which are combinations of letters and numbers do not apply to the prefix rule.  Examples of airport identifiers not using the prefix are  3C2, 7TX6, and M33.So remember, if you are entering or looking for an airport identi- fier that is all letters (no numbers) then it will begin with a ÒKÓ prefix in the contiguous U.S., a ÒPÓ in Alaska (in some cases), or  a ÒCÓ in Canada.  If there are numbers in the identifier then a  prefix is not used.  For other areas of the world the airport iden-  tifier stored in the KLN 89(B) data base is identical to how it is charted.2.4. UPDATING THE DATA BASE The information stored in the data base would eventually become obsolete if there wasnÕt some means to update it.  For example, new  airports open, navaids can move or change frequency, communica- tion frequencies can change, and on and on.Data Base2-4Data BaseChapter 2àAdditionally, by FAA regulation, you are required to have a currentdata base in order to use the KLN 89B for a non-precision approach.The data base is contained in a small card which plugs into the leftside of the KLN 89(B) front panel.  It is designed so that there are two  ways for the user to easily keep the data base current.  The first is to  electronically update the data base by means of a 3.5-inch diskette supplied by Honeywell and an IBM-compatible personal computer. This method does not have to involve removing the KLN 89(B) from the aircraftÕs instrument panel.  A jack, usually mounted in the air-  craftÕs instrument panel, provides a means of interfacing the KLN 89(B) with the computer via an interface cable. The diskettes are not returned to Honeywell.The second method of data base update is to remove the old cardand insert a current card.  This method involves returning the old card to Honeywell.Every 28 days, Honeywell receives new NavDataªinformation from Jeppesen Sanderson.  This information is processed and down-  loaded onto both diskettes and data base cards.  Honeywell makes  these two types of update services available to you in a choice of several subscription or random update programs.  See section 2.6 for  details on these programs.NOTE:Honeywell sends the update so that it arrives prior to the nexteffective date.  The new update may be installed any time prior to the  effective date and the KLN 89(B) will use the previous data up to the effective date and automatically begin using the new data on the effective date.  WARNING: The accuracy of the data base information is onlyassured if it is used before the end of the effectivity period. Use  of out of date data base information is done entirely at the userÕs own risk.2.4.1.  COMPUTER UPDATING OF THE DATA BASE Update information is sent to you on 3.5Ó disks. In order to use theupdate program you must have access to a computer having a disk drive capable utilizing 3.5-inch 1.44 megabyte high density diskettes. This computer also needs to have an available COM 1 or COM 2 ser- ial port. If you wish to perform updates in the cockpit, an optional PC  Interface kit must be used.  Included in the kit is an interface cable  that plugs into both the computer and into the data loader jack. The data loader jack is included with the KLN 89(B) installation kit and is typically installed in the aircraftÕs instrument panel.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideData Base 2-5Data BaseChapter 2Data Base2-6Data BaseChapter 2CAUTION:  The data base must be updated only while the air- craft is on the ground.  The KLN 89(B) does not perform any  navigation function while the data base is being updated.  Since  a data base update takes approximately 5 minutes it is a good  idea to turn off all electrical equipment on the aircraft except for the KLN 89(B) to avoid running down the aircraft battery.NOTE:The diskettes sent to you can only be used to update oneKLN 89(B), although they can update that specific unit numerous times.  The first time the diskettes are used in an update operation, a  unique identification code from the KLN 89(B) being used is uploaded to the diskettes. These diskettes may be used in this specific KLN 89(B) an unlimited number of times which could be required if you switch back and forth between the Americas North, Americas South, Atlantic, and Pacific data bases during one update cycle. These diskettes may not, however, be used to update other KLN 89(B)s. This update protection ensures that Jeppesen Sanderson is properly compensated for the use of their NavDataª.To update the KLN 89(B) data base by computer:1.Plug the 9 pin female connector end of the interface cable into a COM serial port of the computer. If the computer has COM 1 and COM 2 serial ports, either may be used. Some computers use a 9 pin COM serial port connector while other computers use a 25  pin connector.  If the computer being used has a 9 pin connector,  the interface cable connector will plug directly into the computerÕs 9 pin connector. If the computerÕs COM serial port uses a 25 pin connector, use the 25 pin to 9 pin adapter included in the PC  interface kit to adapt the interface cableÕs connector to the  computerÕs connector.2.If you are using the PC interface kit in the cockpit, plug the other end of the interface cable (4 conductor male connector) into the data loader jack that is mounted in the aircraft panel.3.Insert the diskette into the computerÕs disk drive. Turn on the computer being used for the data base update. The program on  the disk will automatically ÒbootÓ (load) and the computer screen will display ÒReadyÓ when the computer is ready to continue withthe data base update operation.4.Turn on the KLN 89(B).  Press  as required to approve theSelf Test, Initialization, and Data Base pages.  Use the right outer knob to select the Setup (SET) type pages and the right innerKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideData Base 2-7Data BaseChapter 2knob to select the SET 3 page (figure 2-2).NOTE: The database key is shownon the SET 3 page for ORS 02 soft- ware only.5.Press  .

The unit will now display Erasing data base.  After the data base has been erased, the loading of the new data automati- cally begins. As the new data is being loaded, the percentage of transfer is displayed (figure 2-5).8.The KLN 89(B) will indicate when the data base update is complete as shown in figure 2-6. You may either turn the KLN 89(B) off at  this point or press to restartthe KLN 89(B).9.Remove the interface cable. Remove the disk from the computer. Turn off the computer.The chances are small of having difficulty updating the data basebutÑIf you have a problem: ¥First check that the interface cable is properly connected and that the computer is turned on.

If you have a problem that you canÕt resolve, write down any error messages to aid your Honeywell Service Center in identifying the problem.2.4.2 CARD EXCHANGE UPDATING OF THE DATA BASE Having the front-loading data card makes KLN 89(B) very easy to update the data base by exchanging cards.Enclose the expired data base card in the mailer that the new cardwas sent to you in.  A return shipping label is included in the mailer.  Please affix this label to the outside of the mailer. Also, peel off the protective backing from the adhesive on the end flap of the mailer.  Press the flap against the adhesive to seal the container.Please return the expired card promptly by mailing immediately atany mailbox.  No postage is required if mailed from within the U.S.  Users will be billed for cards not returned and no additional cards will be sent until either the expired card or payment for the expired card is received.2.5. USER DEFINED DATA BASE In addition to the published data base of airports, VORs, NDBs, and Intersections stored in the Jeppesen data base, you may create up to 500 other user-defined waypoints.  Section 4.6, ÒCreating User-  defined waypointsÓ describes this further.The KLN 89(B) contains an internal lithium battery that is used toÒkeep-aliveÓ the user-defined data base as well as flight plans.  This  battery has a typical life of three to five years.  It is highly recom-  mended that the battery be replaced every three years at an authorized Honeywell Service Center.2-8Data BaseChapter 2Data Base2.6.

COVERAGE AREA The KLN 89(B) was designed to provide worldwide navigation cover-age from North 74¡latitude to South 60¡Latitude (figure 3-2).  Outside this area, magnetic variation must be manually entered as discussed in section 4.10, ÒOperation Outside the Primary Coverage AreaÓ.   See section 2.2 for the data base geographical regions.3.2. TURN-ON AND SELF TESTWell, itÕs time to get down to business and actually use the KLN 89(B)!  Figure 3-1 can be folded out and used as a reference  during the following procedures.  This is especially handy if youÕre  learning while away from your GPS.  The steps below take a lot of  words to explain, but before you know it, you will be ÒflyingÓ through them.NOTE:When power is applied to the KLN 89(B) it always ÒwakesupÓ in the Leg mode. Only the Leg mode is described in this chapter. In this mode the KLN 89(B) performs great circle navigation (the  shortest distance between two points located on the earthÕs surface). The course deviation output displayed on the unitÕs internal course deviation indicator (CDI) and provided to an external horizontal situa- tion indicator (HSI) or CDI is five nautical miles (full scale sensitivity) left and right in Leg mode. The other modes are described in section 4.7 and chapter 5.Figure 3-2 KLN 89 Navigation Coverage Area74¡60¡45¡30¡15¡0¡15¡30¡45¡60¡74¡60¡45¡30¡15¡0¡15¡30¡45¡60¡Basic GPS Operation3-2Basic GPS OperationChapter 3To turn on and initialize the KLN 89(B):1.Turn on the KLN 89(B) by turning the small power knob clockwise.The Power-On page (figure 3-3)will be displayed for a few seconds.  During this time, the  KLN 89(B) performs an extensive internal test.  The operational  revision status (ORS) level num- ber in the upper right corner ofthe display should match the ORS level indicated on the cover of this PilotÕs Guide .When the internal test is complete, the Power-On page will automatically be replaced by the Self Test page (figure 3-4).NOTE:If the KLN 89(B) is operatingin the Take-Home Mode, the Take- Home Warning Page (figure 3-5) is displayed first and must be acknowledged by pressing . Seesection 4.11 for more information on the Take-Home mode.NOTE:If the data base card is notinstalled in the KLN89(B), a page will be displayed as in figure 3-6. Turn the KLN 89(B) unit power back off, and replace the data base card in the left side of the front panel. Once the card is in place, you may apply power once again and the unit will operate properly.2.Verify that the data displayed on the Self Test page is the same as is being displayed on the appropriate equipment in the aircraft which is interfaced to the KLN 89(B).  If the KLN 89(B) is not  connected to any other equipment in the aircraft, you may skip to step 3.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    MFigure 3-4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-6KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-3Basic GPS OperationChapter 3The distance field in the upper left corner always displays 34.5 nm(or 63.9 km). If the KLN 89(B) is interfaced to a compatible indicator that displays DME distance, the indicator should be displaying 34.5 nautical miles.If the KLN 89(B) is interfaced with a NAV indicator such as anHSI or a course deviation indicator (CDI), the deviation bar (D- bar) should be indicating a half scale deviation to the right.  The  TO/FROM indicator should be showing FROM.If the KLN 89(B) is interfaced with a NAV indicator such that theKLN 89(B) can ÒreadÓ the selected course from the NAV  indicator, then the OBSfield should display the same selectedcourse as on the NAV indicator.The RMIfield always displays 130 degrees. If the KLN89(B) is connected to a compatible RMI in the aircraft, the RMI should indicate a bearing to the station of 130 degrees.If any of the above checks fail, do not use the associated indicator with the KLN 89(B).3.If the KLN 89(B) has passed the internal self test, the bottom of the Self Test page will display Passand all external annunciatorsshould be illuminated.  If instead,  Failis displayed, recycle powerto the KLN 89(B).  If the Self Test page still displays  Fail, theKLN 89(B) requires repair and should not be used for navigation.4.When you are ready to approve the Self-test page, press the  button while the Ok?is flashing.  If it happens not to be flashing, press the button and use the right outer knob to move thecursor there.5.The next page displayed will be the Initialization page (figure 3-8). Verify that the date displayed in  the top left corner of the Initialization page is correct.  The  KLN 89(B) has an internal battery powered calendar/clock, so the date and time normally donÕt require setting.  The battery has a life of approximately 3 years.  In addition, the KLN 89(B)Õs system date and time are automati- APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-8cally updated very precisely when at least one satellite is beingreceived.  However, if for some reason the date or time are incor-  rect, it is necessary to enter the correct date or time so that the KLN 89(B) can reach the navigation mode quickly. The date should be correct and the time should be correct within ten minutes so that the KLN 89(B) will start looking for the correct satellites.If the date is incorrect, rotate theright outer knob counterclockwise until the cursor is over the entire date field (figure 3-9).  Rotate the  right inner knob until the correct day of the month is displayed (figure 3-10).  Then, move the  cursor to the month field by rotat- ing the outer knob one click clockwise and change the month as necessary.  Use the same  methods to select the correct year (figure 3-11).  When the date is  correct, press .6.Verify that the time displayed in the upper right corner of the Initialization page is correct to within ten minutes of the actual time.  Remember, once the  KLN 89(B) receives the first satellite, it will automatically be  very accurately updated by the satellite to the correct time.  However, you are responsible for assuring the desired time zone is selected on the KLN 89(B).  If it is  necessary to reset the time,  position the cursor over the time zone field  (figure 3-12) and  select the desired time zone (figure 3-13).Basic GPS OperationBasic GPS OperationChapter 33-4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-12APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˆ˙˘  Figure 3-13APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-10APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-11APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-9KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs Guide 3-5Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Basic GPS OperationThe KLN 89(B) is capable of displaying the following time zones:UTCCoordinated Universal Time (Zulu)GSTGreenland Standard Time (UTC - 3)GDTGreenland Daylight Time (UTC - 2)ATSAtlantic Standard Time (UTC - 4)ATDAtlantic Daylight Time (UTC - 3)ESTEastern Standard Time (UTC - 5)EDTEastern Daylight Time (UTC - 4)CSTCentral Standard Time (UTC - 6)CDTCentral Daylight Time (UTC - 5)MSTMountain Standard Time (UTC - 7)MDTMountain Daylight Time (UTC - 6)PSTPacific Standard Time (UTC - 8)PDTPacific Daylight Time (UTC - 7)AKSAlaska Standard Time (UTC - 9)AKDAlaska Daylight Time (UTC - 8)HASHawaii Standard Time (UTC - 10)HADHawaii Daylight Time (UTC - 9)SSTSamoa Standard Time (UTC - 11)SDTSamoa Daylight Time (UTC - 10)LCLLocal Time Zone (user-defined)You will be able to change the time zone any time you desire onseveral other pages, so donÕt worry if youÕre not sure which time zone to choose.

If this is the case, line 3 will read GPS ApproachesDisabledand you will not have access to approaches in the database.WARNING:  The accuracy of the data base information is assured only if the data base is current.  Operators using an out- of-date data base do so entirely at their own risk.NOTE:If your KLN 89(B) is interfaced with a remote Shadin fuel/air data computer but no fuel flow indicator, the Fuel on Board page will be displayed following the Data Base page (figure 3-21). This page allows you to set the amount of fuel on board (FOB) and initializes the Other (OTH) 7 and 8 fuel planning pages. Possible units are gallons (GAL),pounds (LB), imperial gallons (IMP),liters (L), or kilograms ( KG). If you wish to manually set the FOB, usethe right outer knob to move the cursor to line 2 and use the right inner knob to select the desired value. Another option is to move the cursor to Full?and press , which will update the FOB to thetanks-full value set at the time of installation. To go on, move the cursor to Ok?and press .A waypoint page for the waypoint which was active when the KLN89(B) was last turned off will be displayed on the screen.  If the last  active waypoint was an airport, the APT 5 page showing the airportÕscommunications frequencies will be displayed (figure 3-22).  We thought  youÕd like that!  Almost always, the  waypoint which was active when you last turned the KLN 89(B) off is the airport where you landed.  Therefore,  when you get ready to depart, the airport communication frequencies for that airport will automatically  be displayed for you!APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-22APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-21Basic GPS Operation3-8Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Next, youÕll probably want to check the NAV 2 page to see your presentposition.  Use the right outer knob to select the NAV page type and  then the right inner knob, if necessary,  to select the NAV 2 page.  It is quite  likely that the present position will be dashed at first (figure 3-23).  It takes  the KLN 89(B) a couple of minutes to  acquire the GPS satellites and to make its initial calculation of your position. When the KLN 89(B) reaches a NAV ready status and is able to navigate,  the NAV 2 page will display your pre- sent position relative to the nearest VOR (figure 3-24).  Verify that the pre-  sent position shown on the NAV 2 page is correct.NOTE:In order to reach a Nav ready status, the aircraft must be away from obstructions blocking the  GPS antennaÕs view of required satel-  lites.  If the KLN 89(B) fails to reach a Nav ready status within five  minutes refer to section 3.6, ÒInitialization And Time To First FixÓ.3.3. DISPLAY FORMAT The KLN 89(B) uses a Dot Matrix Gas Plasma Display.  In normal  operation, the display screen is divided into two segments by a vertical line, called the page divider.  In some cases, such as the display of  system messages or the turn-on and self test sequence, the page divider disappears and you have a Òfull-screenÓ page.Aeronautical information is presented on the screen in the form ofÒpagesÓ.  A page is a presentation of specific data in an organized for-  mat.  Various page ÒtypesÓ are used to display related kinds of data.  For example, one page type is NAV (navigation).  NAV pages show  information such as distance, groundspeed, bearing, course, and other  data relating to navigation.  Another page type is APT (airport).  APT  pages contain information pertinent to a specific airport such as name,  city, state, elevation, and direction and distance relative to the aircraftÕs  present position.The units of measure for displayed information can be changed using the SET 8 page. (Refer to section 2-12 for details on this page.) The  altimeter barometric setting can be set to inches of Mercury (Ò), mil- libars (mB), or hectopascals (hP). Altitude, airport elevation, and runway lengths can be set to feet (ft) or meters (m). Finally, distances  and velocities can be set to nautical miles (nm) and knots (kt) or kilo- APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-23APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-24KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-9Basic GPS OperationChapter 3meters (km) and kilometers/hour (k/h). Changing any of the units of measure only affects the information displayed on the unit. It does not affect any of the data output by the unit.The brightness of the display is controlled by a photocell on the    KLN 89(B) front panel.  The brighter the light level, the brighter the display  will be.  The minimum (nighttime) brightness is set at the factory to a  level that is appropriate for most installation.  In some cases, however,  it may be desired to change the minimum brightness level (e.g. an  unusually dark cockpit environment). The SET 11 page controls the  minimum brightness.To adjust the minimum display brightness: 1.Select the SET 11 page (figure 3-25) and turn on the cur-  sor (). The display brightnesshas a range of zero (0) to 9 with zero being the dimmest, 9 being the brightest, and 4 being the normal default level.2.Turn the right inner knob to select the desired brightness (figure 3-26).  To test the bright-  ness level, you will probably want to be in a dark-cockpit condition.If desired, you can also test it out by placing your finger over the photocell in the upper left corner of the KLN 89(B)3.Turn off the cursor ( ).The top left corner of the screen always displays distance to the active waypoint, in nice large numbers (figure 3-27). The identifier of the active waypoint is usually displayedon the second line. This area of the display will be particularly useful to you if you are shooting non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B, since it lets you know where youÕre going and how far until youget there.NOTE:In cases when the activewaypoint identifier is displayed on the right side of the page divider, line 2  will display the current groundspeed (figure 3-28).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-28APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-27APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-25APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    &Figure 3-26Basic GPS Operation3-10Basic GPS OperationChapter 3NOTE:For purposes of this PilotÕsGuide, many of the screen  illustrations do not show actual  navigation data in this area as in figure 3-29. In these cases, the  displayed data is not relevant to the discussion of the KLN 89(B)Õs operation.The third line of the left side has threepurposes: (1) If the KLN 89(B) is  ready for you to approve something,  such as a selected waypoint, the ÒEntÓ prompt will flash (figure 3-30),indicating you should press the button to continue. (2) If the KLN  89(B) has a new message for you which must be viewed on a message page, a large ÒMÓ will flash in thesame area (figure 3-31) telling you to press the button and view thenew message. (3) Immediately to the right of the Òmessage/enterÓ  display area, the navigation mode (see section 4.7 for details) is dis- played. If the KLN 89(B) is in the Leg mode (the normal mode of operation), ÒLegÓ will be displayed here.The bottom line on the left side of the page divider indicates the pagetype that is being displayed on the right side of the screen. In figure 3-31, the NAV 1 (Navigation 1) page is being displayed.You might think of the page types as the chapters in a book and thepage numbers as the pages within a chapter. Just as a chapter in a book may have from one to many pages, a KLN 89(B) page type may have from three to 25 pages associated with it. There are, for  example, 25 flight plan pages (FPL 0, FPL 1, FPL 2, É FPL 25) in the flight plan page type and up to eight airport pages (APT 1, APT 2, É APT 8) in the airport page type.Figure 3-32 shows an example of an APT 5 page. Notice the Ò+Ó signin the page identification. Whenever a Ò+Ó sign is part of a page identifier there will be two or more pages, all having the same page number, used to present all of the required  information.

In this case the Ò+Ó sign indicates that there are two or more APT 5 pages. Figure 3-33 shows the second APT 5 page for KICT (Wichita Mid-Continent Airport).The lower left corner of the display,where the page type and number are usually displayed, can also display short operational messages to the user called Òscratchpad messagesÓ. These messages are displayed forapproximately five seconds, then this area returns to a display of the page type and number.  Figure 3-34 shows an example of a scratch-  pad message indicating a duplicate identifier. A complete listing of scratchpad messages is available in Appendix C of this PilotÕs Guide.3.4. BASIC OPERATION OF PANEL CONTROLS The KLN 89(B) controls are very easy to use.  Most of the page  selection and data entry is done with the knobs on the right side of the front panel and the cursor () button immediately above them.There are seven buttons across the bottom: (Message), ,(Altitude), (Nearest), (Direct To), (Clear), and  (Enter).The cursor position is indicated by flashing, underlined text on thescreen.  Many pages allow you to add, delete, or change data on the  screen by first pressing the button to turn the cursor function onand bring the cursor on the screen. The right knobs are then used to enter or change data.  When the cur-  sor is on the screen, the lower left corner of the screen will show  *CRSR*rather than the page namefor that particular page (figure 3-35). The cursor is over PRESENT POSN.In addition, this PilotÕs Guide uses white ÒwhiskersÓ to depict flashingcharacters on the screen.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ( Figure 3-34APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-35APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-333.4.1. PAGE SELECTIONIt is now time to learn to select a desired page.NOTE:The cursor function is not used in selecting pages and thebutton should not be pressed at this time.  If  CRSRis annunciat-ed in the lower left corner of the display, press the button to turn the cursor function off.The right outer knob is rotated to select one of eleven page types forthe display.  These eleven page types are the following:Remember that the page type is displayed at the lower left corner ofthe screen.  The first three letters of the page type are often used for  annunciation on the screen, for example, CALrepresents Calculatorpage.  The page type is also annunciated by means of a bar at the  bottom of the display, which moves as you turn the right outer knob.  All the page types are listed across the front panel directly under thedisplay, and the bar will always be over one of them.  For example, letÕs  say you were on a NAV page    (figure 3-36) and you wanted to turn to a SET page.  You would look at the list  and see that the SET pages are three places to the right of the NAV pages.Basic GPS Operation3-12Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-36Chapter Name/ Page # RangePage TypePage Functions APT 1-6*AirportDirectory of published airports  VOR 1-2VORDirectory of published VOR stations  NDB 1-2NDBDirectory of published non-directional beacons (NDB)  INT 1-2IntersectionsDirectory of published named intersections  USR 0-3User WaypointDirectory of user-defined waypoints  ACT **Active WaypointInformation about the active waypoint  NAV 1-4NavigationNavigation data  FPL 0-25Flight PlanActive and stored flight plans  CAL 1-8CalculatorDistance, bearing, time and fuel calculator; air data calculations based on pilot-entered inputsSET 1-11SetupSetting initial position and date/time, updating the data base, and selecting certain featuresOTH 1-6***OtherStatus reports, and deleting user wpts and remarks  *KLN 89B\\'s which are approved for non-precision approaches have 8 airport pages. **Varies with the type of waypoints in the active flight plan.  ***Up to 12 with fuel management system and air data interfaces. KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-13Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Therefore, turning the right outerknob three clicks clockwise will get you to the SET pages (figure 3-37). The annunciator bar and the page labels work kind of like a map to get you from one page type to another.  The page type selection wrapsaround from Other (OTH) to Airport (APT); that is, the knob has no  mechanical stops.Once you have selected the desired page type using the right outerknob, you may select the page number by rotating the right inner knob.  LetÕs use an example to make sure you understand.  You are  presently viewing the APT 2 page and you wish to view the NAV 3 page.  Rotating the right outer knob 6 (six) clicks clockwise will  display the NAV page that you last viewedÑweÕll say the NAV 2 page.  Turning the right inner knob one click clockwise or three clicks  counterclockwise will bring you to the NAV 3 page.  Got it?NOTE:In this PilotÕs Guide the right smaller knob is assumed to bein the ÒinÓ position unless it specifically states that the knob should be in the ÒoutÓ position.  Therefore, the words Òrotate the right inner  knobÓ mean to turn the right inner knob while the knob is in the ÒinÓ position.3.4.2. DATA ENTRY Now that youÕve learned how to select the desired page, youÕre readyto learn the means of entering data.  It is necessary to enter data, for  example, in order to specify a waypoint of your choice to go Direct To.  The general procedure for entering a waypoint identifier is described below and is shown in fig- ures 3-38 through 3-46 for entering a  waypoint (in this case, First Flight air- port in North Carolina, identifier KFFA) on the Calculator (CAL) 1 page.To enter a waypoint identifier: 1.If the cursor is not on the screen (figure 3-38), press to turn onthe cursor function (figure 3-39).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-39APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-38APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-37Basic GPS Operation3-14Basic GPS OperationChapter 32.If required, rotate the right outer knob to position the cursor (figure 3-40).3.Rotate the right inner knob to select the first character of the waypoint identifier (figure 3-41).4.Turn the right outer knob one click clockwise to move the cursor to the second character position (figure 3-42).5.Rotate the right inner knob to select the second character (figure 3-43).6.Use the right outer and inner knobs in this manner until the complete waypoint identifier is  displayed (figure 3-44).  Note that  you may not have to enter the last characters of the identifier because each time you enter a character, the KLN 89(B) offers you the first identifier in the data base beginning with the charac- ters you have entered.7.If  Entis flashing on the left side of the screen, then press  .This will prompt the KLN 89(B) to  display a waypoint page for the waypoint identifier you just entered (figure 3-45).8.Verify the waypoint information displayed, and then press again to approve the waypoint  page.  The display will return to  the page previously displayed (figure 3-46).Often, you will find yourself enteringairports that begin with the same  character over and over again.

Also, many airport identifiers in  Europe begin with the letter E or the letter L. Especially when flying VFR, you will mostly want to enter Direct To or Flight Plan waypoints which are airports. The KLN 89(B) has a great feature that will save you turns of the knob when you know that the first character will probably be a K, E, L, or other letter that is commonly used in your part of the world.  You can set the default first waypoint identifier  character on the SET 5 page.To change the default first way-point identifier character:1.Select the SET 5 page (figure 3- 47) and turn on the cursor ( )(figure 3-48).2.Use the right inner knob to select the desired character (figure 3-49), such as a K in the U.S., a C in Canada, a P in  Alaska, an E or an L in Europe,  etc.3.Turn off the cursor.  To try it out, proceed to the SET 1 page (initial position).  Turn the cursor ( )on (it will come on over the way- point field).  Try turning the right  inner knob one click clockwise (figure 3-50). ThereÕs the character you just selected on the SET 5 page!3.4.3. THE DUPLICATEWAYPOINT PAGEThere are some waypoints in the data base whose identifiers are notunique.  That is, more than one waypoint has the same identifier.  When a waypoint identifier has been entered which is not unique to a single waypoint, a Duplicate Waypoint page appears on the screen. The Duplicate Waypoint page is used to select which of the waypoints having the same identifier is actually desired.  The  waypoint identifier is displayed on the top left of the page.  To the  right of the identifier is the number of waypoints in the data base  having the identifier.  Below the identifier is a list of the waypoint APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH a  Figure 3-50APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-47APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-48APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   \\'Figure 3-49Basic GPS Operation3-16Basic GPS OperationChapter 3types (APT, VOR, NDB, INT, USR) and the associated countrieswhich use the identifier.To see an example of a Duplicate Waypoint page, try entering the identifier ÒDÓ as a Direct To waypoint or a Flight Plan Waypoint:1.Press  .2.Select the letter Ò DÓ as thewaypoint identifier (figure 3-51).

The list includes an NDB in Canada, an NDB in Cuba, and an NDB in the U.S.  The cursor  will be over the first waypoint listed.  They are listed with the way-  point closest to the aircraftÕs present position displayed first and the waypoint farthest from the aircraft displayed last.  To view the  rest of the choices, rotate the right outer knob clockwise.  Doing  so will move the flashing cursor over waypoints two, three and then will cause the waypoint list to ÒscrollÓ so that the other way- points in the list may be seen.4.To select the desired waypoint, move the cursor over the  appropriate choice (figure 3-53).5.Press  and the display willchange to the waypoint page for the selected waypoint (figure 3- 54).6.Press  again to approve thewaypoint page.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-53APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-54APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-52APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-513.4.4. CYCLIC FIELDSOn many of the KLN 89(B) pages,there are cyclic fields, which are pre-ceded by a carat (>).  A cyclic field is one that you as the pilot can select from two or more options.  For exam-  ple, in figure 3-55, the field  >135¡To(magnetic bearing to Austin VOR) is a cyclic field.  In this case, the  second option is the magnetic radial from Austin VOR to presentposition.To change a cyclic field: 1.Turn on the cursor by pressing the button (figure 3-56).2.Using the right outer knob, move the cursor over the cyclic field you wish to change (figure 3-57).3.Press the  button to changethe cyclic field (figure 3-58).  Notice that repeated pressesÒcycleÓ you through the choices. In this case there are only two, so works like a toggle switch.3.5. MESSAGE PAGE Whenever the KLN 89(B) wants to get your attention, the message  prompt (a large ÒMÓ on the left side of  the screen) begins flashing (figure 3- 60).  If you have a remote message  annunciator in your aircraft, it will also begin flashing at that time.  You should view the message at your  earliest opportunity because the unit may be alerting you to some sit- uation of immediate concern to its condition or to your flight. A description of each possible message is included in Appendix B of  this PilotÕs Guide.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-17Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-60APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-55APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH =:  Figure 3-56APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-57APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-58To view a message:1.Press the  button.

If a message con-  dition exists which requires a specific action by you, the message prompt will remain on but will not flash.3.6. INITIALIZATION AND TIME TO FIRST FIX Since the KLN 89(B) stores its position and other required parameters  in memory when power to the unit is removed, it is seldom necessary  to aid the unit in reaching a NAV ready condition.  The time required  from power on until the KLN 89(B) determines its present position and  is therefore ready to navigate is called Òtime to first fix.Ó  The time to first  fix is normally a few minutes or less. In order for the KLN 89(B) to reach a NAV ready condition, it is necessary to meet the following con- ditions:1.The KLN 89(B)Õs ÒalmanacÓ data should be current.  Almanac data is orbital information for all the satellites and is used for initial acquisition when the KLN 89(B) is first turned on.  This data is  stored in the KLN 89(B)Õs non-volatile memory and is considered  current for up to six months.  Each satellite sends almanac data for  all satellites.  Since the KLN 89(B) routinely updates the almanac  data during normal operation, the almanac data will become out of  date only if the KLN 89(B) hasnÕt been used for the previous six  months or longer.  Collecting new almanac data takes place auto-  matically if the data is more than six months old. If the almanac data is out of date and needs to be collected, the KLN 89(B) will  take a few minutes to acquire your present position (usually about  six (6) minutes, but not more than 12 minutes). The Self Test, Initialization, and Data Base pages should be approved.  2.The aircraft must be located such that the GPS antenna has an unobstructed view of the sky so that required satellite signals are Basic GPS Operation3-18Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-61KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-19Basic GPS OperationChapter 3not being blocked.  If possible, position the aircraft away from hangars or other obstructions. 3.It is very helpful for the KLN 89(B) to have the correct time, date and position to be able to determine which satellites should be in view. This information is stored in the battery backed memory of  the KLN 89(B) so it is not normally required to update it. If the KLN  89(B) has the correct time, date and position, then the time to first  fix will usually be less than two (2) minutes. If this information is not  correct, then the KLN 89(B) will start to look for any satellites. Eventually, the KLN 89(B) will find enough satellites to determine the position of the aircraft. This process can take as long as 12 minutes. It is possible for you to update this information manually,  which will allow the KLN 89(B) to reach a NAV ready status much  faster. To set the time and date follow steps 5 and 6 in section 3.2,  ÒTurn-On and Self-Test.Ó The initial position is usually set during turn-on and self-test, but if for some reason it is necessary to update the position after the power-on sequence, then use the fol-  lowing steps. Remember, if acquisition time is not important then it  is not necessary to update the time, date or position.To initialize the position from the SET 1 page: 1.If the cursor is not on the screen (figure 3-62), press the buttonto bring it on the page over the INIT POSfield (figure 3-63).2.Using the right inner and outer knobs, enter the identifier for the airport where you are presently located or the identifier of a navaid  or other airport which is close to your present position (figure 3-64).  Any waypoint in the data base which is within 60 miles is accept- able, but the closer the better. Remember, if you are entering an  airport identifier that is all letters (no numbers), then it will begin with a ÒKÓ prefix in the contiguous  U.S., a ÒPÓ in Alaska (in some cases; in others, the prefix is not added), or a ÒCÓ in Canada.  If there are numbers in the identifier  then a prefix is not used.  Outside the contiguous U.S., Alaska, and Canada, use the airport identifiers as they are charted.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-62APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-63APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˇ//  Figure 3-64Basic GPS Operation3-20Basic GPS OperationChapter 33.Once you have entered the complete identifier, press .The display will change to the waypoint page for the waypoint  you entered (figure 3-65).4.If this is the waypoint you intended to enter, press  again.  The display will change back to the SET 1 page.NOTE:As an alternative, you can also enter the approximate latitude and longitude of your present position directly on the SET 1 page instead of entering a waypoint.5.With the right inner knob, position the cursor over Ok?, if it is notalready there (figure 3-66).6.Press  to approve the initialposition. The cursor will  automatically be removed from the screen.NOTE:If the KLN 89(B) is in the Take-Home mode, you are allowed to  enter the groundspeed ( kt) and head-ing (¡) fields in order to simulate flight (figure 3-67).  They are not used for  actual initialization in an aircraft. However, entering a ground speed will  allow the KLN 89(B) to ÒflyÓ along the active flight plan (or to a direct to  waypoint) starting from the initialization waypoint.  A heading may be  entered in the initial heading field while in the Take-Home mode if the  one offered is not desired.  See section 4.11 for more details on the  Take-Home mode.7.Select the NAV 2 page. When the KLN 89(B) reaches the NAV ready status and is therefore able to navigate, the NAV 2 page will display the present position. Verify that the latitude and longitude or the waypoint, radial, and distance display of present position are  correct.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-67APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-66APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-653.7. SELECTING AND SCANNING WAYPOINTS There are five types of waypoints: airports, VORs, NDBs, intersections,and user waypoints.  Waypoints in the published data base fall into one  of the first four types.  You can create up to 500 user waypoints to  supplement the waypoints in the data base (see section 4.2.1 to create  a user waypoint).There are three methods you may use to select a specific waypoint for viewing.  You may enter the waypointÕs identifier directly, you may scan  through the waypoint identifiers in alphabetical order, or you may enter  the waypointÕs name.  If the waypoint is an airport, you may also select  it by entering the city where the airport is located.3.7.1. SELECTING WAYPOINTS BY IDENTIFIER The most direct way of selecting a specific waypoint is to simply enterthe waypointÕs identifier directly on the appropriate waypoint page type (APT, for example).  LetÕs use Chicago OÕHare International  Airport whose identifier is KORD as an example.To select a waypoint by identifier from a waypoint page: 1.Use the right outer and inner knobs to select the Airport 1 (APT 1) page (figure 3-68).  (Actually,  the airport identifier can be  entered on any of the Airport pages but weÕll use the APT 1 since it displays the airport name and city).2.Turn on the cursor ( ) andmake sure the right inner knob is pushed in.  The cursor will  appear over the first character of the airport identifier (figure 3-69).3.Turn the right inner knob to select a ÒKÓ as the first character (figure  3-70).  You may turn the knob  either clockwise or counterclock- wise, and the letters and  numbers wrap around with a blank character separating the Ò9Ó and the ÒAÓ.  Notice that as  you turn through letters, the KLN 89(B) automatically fills in the identifier of the first waypoint in alphanumeric order in the data-KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-21Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-68APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH /  Figure 3-69APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH \\'  Figure 3-70Basic GPS Operation3-22Basic GPS OperationChapter 3base which matches what youÕveentered so far (in this case, Hall Airport in Kaufman, Texas).  Go  ahead and experiment a little bit.4.Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the second  character and select an ÒOÓ  (figure 3-71).5.Use the same process to select an ÒRÓ and then a ÒDÓ          (figure 3-72).  You are now viewing the  APT 1 page for KORD.The KLN 89(B) feature of filling in characters of the identifier can be atime saver!  For a second example, letÕs select Bloomington VOR  whose identifier is BMI.More selecting a waypoint by identifier:1.Make sure you have turned the cursor off from the previous example.  With the right knobs,  select the VOR 1 page (figure 3-73).2.Turn the cursor ( ) on.3.Change the first character to a ÒBÓ (figure 3-74).4.Move the cursor to the second character and select Ò MÓ(figure 3-75).  Eureka!  When you  entered the ÒMÓ, the KLN 89(B)searched its data base for the first VOR identifier beginning with the letters ÒBMÓ and found BMI.Many times you will only have to enter two or three characters of the waypoint identifier and the KLN 89(B) will furnish the rest.5.Turn off the cursor ( ).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-73APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-74APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH 0  Figure 3-75APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-71APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-723.7.3. SELECTING WAYPOINTS BY SCANNINGYou may also select waypoints by scanning through them.  This may be done with the cursor either on or off.To select a waypoint by scanning with the cursor off: 1.Select the page type for the waypoint you are looking for (APT, VOR, NDB, INT or USR).2.Pull the right inner knob to the ÒoutÓ position.  3.Turn the right inner knob clockwise to scan through the waypoints in alphabetical order, or counterclockwise to scan in reverse alphabetical order.  Remember that numbers are  considered lower in order than letters.  Thus, the airport identifier  KA2comes before KAAF.NOTE:The faster you turn the knob while scanning, the larger thestep through the waypoints.  This variable rate scanning allows you to get from one end of the list to the other very quickly.  When the knob  is turned slowly, you will go through the waypoints one at a time.You may also want to scan waypoints with the cursor on.  This is especially useful if you remember the first part of the identifier, or if you wanted to scan all airports that start with a KL, for example.LetÕs give it a try.To select a waypoint by scanning with the cursor on: 1.Select the page type for the waypoint you are looking for (APT, VOR, NDB, INT or USR).  In this case, we want the APT 1 page.2.Turn on the cursor ( ).  It will appear over the first character of the waypoint identifier.  Select a  Kwith the right inner knob.3.Move the cursor one place to the right and select an L(figure 3-76).4.Move the cursor one place to the right and pull the right inner knob out.  The last two characters of  the waypoint identifier will be flashing (figure 3-77).KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-23Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH 1  Figure 3-76APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-77Basic GPS Operation3-24Basic GPS OperationChapter 35.Use the right inner knob to leaf through all the data base airports whose identifiers begin with KL.You will see KL6, Little Bear LakeAirport in Saskatchewan (figure 3- 78), and KLAS, McCarranInternational in Las Vegas,Nevada among others.3.7.4. SELECTING WAYPOINTS BY NAME OR CITY When you know the identifier of the desired waypoint you will useone of the two methods just described to select it.  However, what if  you know the name but you donÕt know the identifier of your desired waypoint?  YouÕre in luck because the KLN 89(B) will allow you to  enter the first few characters of the name to help you find it in the data base.  We will use a couple of examples to illustrate how this is  done.  For VORs and NDBs, you may use the navaid name.  For air-  ports, you may use the airport name or the city name (where the  airport is located).In this first example we want to view the information in the KLN 89(B)data base for Napoleon VOR (located just east of Kansas City) but we donÕt remember the identifier for it.To select a VOR or NDB by navaid name:1.With the cursor off, use the right knobs to select the VOR 1 page  (figure 3-79).  The VOR waypoint  in view is not important.2.Press  and then make surethe right inner knob is pushed to the ÒinÓ position.3.With the right outer knob, move the cursor over the first character in the VOR name which is being displayed (figure 3-80).4.Change this first character to an ÒNÓ in this case (figure 3-81).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˜ Figure 3-80APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-81APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-79APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-78KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-25Basic GPS OperationChapter 35.Move the cursor one space to the right and select the second char- acter, ÒAÓ (figure 3-82).6.Select the third character, Ò PÓ(figure 3-83).  Up pops Napoleon  and its identifier, ANX!7.Turn off the cursor ( ) so youcan view other pages.We will now use another example to show how we may enter a few char- acters and then scan through all thewaypoints in the data base beginning with those characters. LetÕs use this method to find La Guardia Airport in New York City.To select an airport by scanning the airport name: 1.With the cursor off and the right inner knob in the ÒinÓ position, select the APT (Airport) 1 page.  The airport displayed at this time is not important.2.Turn on the cursor ( ).3.Move the cursor over the first character in the airport name (figure 3-84).4.Change the first character to an ÒLÓ.5.Move the cursor one place to the right, and select an Ò AÓ(figure 3-85).6.Now, move the cursor one place to the right and pull the right inner knob out.  The rest of the airport  name field will flash (figure 3-86).7.Turn the right inner knob clock- wise, scanning through La Crosse Municipal, La Grande/Union airport, and several others.  Eventually, you  will arrive at ÒLA GUARDIA Ó(figure 3-87).

ÒNEARESTÓ FUNCTIONSAt any time, you can have access to the nearest airports, waypoints,Special Use Airspace (SUA), Flight Service Station (FSS) frequen- cies, and Center frequencies to your position.  Your ticket to do this is  the handy button.When you first press the button,a page is displayed asking which nearest function you would like to  select (figure 3-88).  The choices are:APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-88APTAirportsVORVORsNDBNDBsINTIntersectionsUSRUser-defined waypointsSUASpecial Use AirspacesFSSFlight Service Station FrequenciesCTRCenter FrequenciesTo select the desired nearest function, use the right inner knob tomove the cursor to the desired selection and press .  Notice that the cursor is initially over the APTfield, so you may press thenpress immediately to access the nearest airports.Selecting any of the waypoint types(APT, VOR, NDB, INT, or USR)takes you immediately to the way-  point page for the first nearest  waypoint of that type, for example, the nearest airport (figure 3-89).3.8.1. VIEWING THE NEAREST WAYPOINTS There are actually two waypoint scan lists for airports, VORs, NDBs,intersections and user-defined waypoints.  These two lists are the  ÒcompleteÓ list and the ÒnearestÓ list.  The complete list contains all of  the waypoints in the data base for a waypoint type (all the airports, for example).  The nearest list consists of the nine nearest waypoints (of  that type) to your present position.  Therefore, if you are in the near-  est airport list, it will contain the nine nearest airports relative to your location.The nearest list is positioned in front of the complete list.  That is, instead of using the button, you may scan backwards (turn theright inner knob counterclockwise while in the Òpulled outÓ position) through the complete list to reach the nearest list.  You will know  when you have reached the nearest list because the top middle por- tion of the waypoint page will flash the relative position of the waypoint to your position.  Ò 1Ó indicates nearest (figure 3-89) while Ò9Óindicates the ninth nearest (figure 3-  90).  As you scan clockwise with the  right inner knob Ò1, 2, 3, ..., 9Ó, thenext scan position is the beginning of the complete list.  The nearest list can KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-27Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-89APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-90only be reached by scanning backwards. It does not wrap aroundafter the last waypoint in the complete list.Waypoint pages displayed in the nearest list do not contain a latitudeand longitude position as they do in the complete list.  Instead, the  bearing and distance to the waypoint (or the radial and distance from the waypoint) are displayed.  In addition, nearest airport pages dis-  play the length, surface, and lighting of the longest runway.  Once the  nearest waypoint is being displayed, the other waypoint pages (for example, APT 2 and APT 3) for that airport are available for display by making sure the right inner knob is pushed in and then turning it to select the desired airport page.3.8.1.1  Nearest Airport CriteriaThe nine airports in the nearest list are the nine airports which meetthe criteria selected on the Setup 6 (SET 6) page. For example, youprobably wouldnÕt want to take a turboprop into a 1500 foot grass strip! The SET 6 page allows you to specify what criteria you want an airport to meet before it is considered for the nearest airport list.To specify the nearest airport criteria: 1.Select the SET 6 page and turn on the cursor ( ).2.Use the right inner knob to select the minimum length runway desired for the airport to qualify for the nearest airport list (figure 3-91).  Values between 1000 feet  and 5000 feet or between 300m and 1500m in 100 foot or meter increments may be selected.3.Rotate the right outer knob clockwise to move the cursor over the runway surface criteria.4.Turn the right inner knob to select either  HRDor ANY.  If  ANYischosen, then both hard and soft surface runways meeting the required runway length will be included in the nearest airport list. If HRDis chosen, then only hard surface runways will be includ-ed.  Hard surface runways include concrete, asphalt, pavement,  tarmac, brick, bitumen, and sealed.  Soft surface runways include  turf, gravel, clay, sand, dirt, ice, steel matting, shale, and snow.For example, if the minimum runway criteria selected is 2200feet inlength and HRDsurface, then only airport having a hard surface runwayat least 2200 feet in length will be displayed in the nearest airport list.Basic GPS Operation3-28Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-91KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-29Basic GPS OperationChapter 33.8.1.2  Continuous Display of Nearest AirportWhen the nearest airport page is initially displayed, Ò1Ó is displayed inthe upper right hand corner of the page to designate this airport as the nearest airport.  However, if you continue to fly along your flight  plan with this page selected, the same airport will be displayed and its position in the nearest airport list will change from 1to 2, 3, 4... 9until finally it wonÕt be in the nearest airport list at all.  The reason for  this is that in the event of an actual emergency once you have determined which airport you are heading for, you donÕt want the nearest airport list to update while you are maneuvering or looking up data on the other airport pages for that airport.There may be times, however, when youÕre flying over ÒunfriendlyÓterrain when you wish to always have the nearest airport displayed on the screen.To display the nearest airport continuously: 1.Display the nearest airport page by pressing  followed bypressing .2.Turn on the cursor ( ).3.Rotate the right outer knob clockwise to position the cursor over Ò1Ó (figure 3-92).  As long as the cursor is left in this position, this page will update so that the nearest airport is always shown as the flight progresses.3.8.2. VIEWING THE NEAREST SPECIAL USE AIRSPACES The KLN 89(B) data base stores the locations of areas of special useairspace (SUA).  The types of SUA areas stored in the data base and the abbreviations used to denote these areas are the following:Class BCL BClass CCL CControl Area (used outside USA)CTATerminal Area (used outside USA)TMAAlert AreaALRTCaution AreaCAUTDanger AreaDNGRMilitary Operations AreaMOAProhibited AreaPROHRestricted AreaRESTAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH $  Figure 3-92Basic GPS Operation3-30Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Training AreaTRNGWarning AreaWARNTerminal Radar Service AreaTRSAThe nearest special use airspace fea-ture is constantly keeping track of the five nearest areas of SUA.  Pressing  the button and selecting the SUAoption will display the SUA 1 page for the nearest SUA to your location, including those which you are inside(figure 3-93).  Turn to section 3.17 to learn more about how an alti-  tude input affects special use airspace sensing and how the KLN  89(B) determines if you are inside special use airspace or not.The SUA 1 page displays the following information: Line 1:The name of the special use airspace area.Line 2:The SUA type (see the list of abbreviations above, thisparticular SUA is Class B airspace), and the sequence number (1st nearest, 2nd nearest, etc.).Line 3:The altitude limits of the SUA.Line 4:The proximity of the nearest point on the border of the SUA,in the form of the absolute bearing, relative bearing, and distance to the SUA border.  The absolute bearing is the approximate heading  you would fly to most quickly get into the SUA.  The relative bearing  arrow in the middle of this line points to the SUA border, telling you if it is directly ahead of you (cc), straight off your left wing (dd), etc.  Finally, the distance to the SUA is displayed on the right side of line 4.If the aircraft is inside the SUA, line 4 will read *A/C INSIDE SUA*, ifyou are above or below the SUA, as indicated by the encoding altimeter, line 4 will indicate this (*A/C ABOVESUA* or *A/C BELOW SUA*).A single clockwise turn of the rightinner knob selects the SUA 2 page, which displays either the controlling ATC facility (figure 3-94), or if the spe- cial use airspace is a Class B, Class C, CTA, or TMA, the page will be dis- played as in figure 3-95, instructing you to press to see the APT 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-94APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-95APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-93KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-31Basic GPS OperationChapter 3page (airport communications) for the primary airport so that the cor-rect communications frequency may be determined.To scan through the remainder of the nearest SUA areas, pull theright inner knob to the ÒoutÓ position and turn it clockwise to view the SUA pages for the  second nearest through fifth nearest SUAs.NOTE:The KLN 89(B) displays the five nearest SUAs regardless ofyour present altitude and the altitude limits of the SUA.  For instance, it will include SUAs specified as ÒBelow 6000ftÓ even if you are cruis- ing at 10,000 feet.3.8.3. Viewing the Nearest Flight Service Station FrequenciesThe KLN 89(B) stores in its data base the locations of Flight ServiceStations (FSS) and their remote communications sites.  In addition,  the KLN 89(B) determines which two of these FSS points of commu- nication are closest to your present location.  What a convenience for  you!  Next time you want to file a flight plan from the air or contact an  FSS for some other reason, you can easily use the KLN 89(B) to determine a suitable FSS and the appropriate frequency. NOTE:In some areas of the world the KLN 89(B) provides the loca-tion of the nearest point of communication with a facility providing information (INF) or radio (RDO) services.Pressing the button and selecting the FSSoption will display twoof the nearest points of communication with Flight Service Stations. There will normally be two FSS 1 pages, one for each of the two points of contact.  The name of the FSS is at the top of the page.  There can be from one to three frequencies included for a point of contact (figure 3-96).  Remember that  in the U.S. the frequency 122.00 MHz is used for ÒFlight WatchÓ and the fre- quency 123.60 MHz is used for  Aeronautical Advisory Service.  As  you know, it is often possible to com- municate with an FSS by transmitting on 122.10 MHz and listening on the VOR frequency.  In cases like this,  the FSS 1 page displays the frequen- cies to use for transmit and receive and also the name of the VOR  through which you are communicat- ing (figure 3-97).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-96APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-973.8.4. Viewing the Nearest Center FrequenciesThe KLN 89(B) also stores in its database the low altitude boundaries of each of the ARTCC ÒCentersÓ.  The  KLN 89(B) determines the proper Center to contact and the appropriate frequencies to use for the aircraftÕs present position.  Pressing the  button and selecting the CTRoption will display this information toyou (figure 3-98).  Next time you wish to obtain VFR flight following or  communicate with Center for any reason, you have a quick way to get a frequency for establishing contact!  Appendix D contains a list-  ing of Center abbreviations used on the CTR page.NOTE:Frequencies for Area Control Centers are displayed on theCTR page for some areas of the world.3.9. DIRECT TO OPERATION The button is used to initiate DirectTo operation (navigation from your pre- sent position direct to your destination). When is pressed, the Direct Topage will be displayed with a flashing  cursor over a waypoint identifier (figure 3-99).  The waypoint identifier which appears on the Direct To page is  chosen by the KLN 89(B) according to the following rules:1.If the Flight Plan 0 (FPL 0) page is displayed on the screen and the cursor is over one of the waypoint identifiers in FPL 0 when  ispressed, then that waypoint identifier will appear on the DIR page. You will appreciate this feature when you learn to use flight plans in section 4.2.2.If the KLN 89(B) is displaying the NAV 4 page and the right inner knob is in the ÒoutÓ position, then the waypoint highlighted in the lower right hand corner of the NAV 4 map display will be the default waypoint. You will also find this feature useful when operating from the active flight plan especially during approaches with the KLN 89B.OR . . . 3.If there is any waypoint page (APT, VOR, NDB, INT, USR, or ACT page) in view when  is pressed, then the DIR page will contain the identifier for the waypoint just viewed.Basic GPS Operation3-32Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ,aFigure 3-99APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-98KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-33Basic GPS OperationChapter 3If none of the conditions above are occurring, then:4.When  is pressed, the waypoint identifier for the current active waypoint will be displayed. àHowever, if the KLN 89BÕsactive waypoint is the Missed Approach Point and the aircraft has flown past the MAP, then the KLN 89B will display the first way- point of the missed approach procedure on the Direct To page.If there is no active waypoint when is pressed, then:5.The Direct To page displays blanks in the waypoint identifier field.  In order for there not to be an active waypoint, there is no  Direct To waypoint and there are no waypoints in Flight Plan 0.3.9.1. INITIATING A DIRECT TO Now that you know the ground rules, letÕs go ahead and try somepractical examples.  First, letÕs say we wanted to fly directly to  Wexford County Airport in Cadillac, Michigan.  Its ICAO identifier is  KCAD.To fly Direct To a waypoint (procedure 1): 1.Press  . The Direct To page isdisplayed (figure 3-100). The cursor will already be on. A waypoint identifier may or may not be displayed, it doesnÕt matter at this point.2.Rotate the right inner knob to select the first character of the desired waypointÕs identifier, in this case, a Ò KÓ (figure 3-101).Remember to enter the ÒKÓ, ÒCÓ, or ÒPÓ prefix for certain airports in  North America, if required (see  section 2.3, ÒICAO IdentifiersÓ).3.Turn the right outer knob one click clockwise to move the flash- ing portion of the cursor over the second character position (figure 3-102).4.Rotate the right inner knob to select the second character of the identifier (figure 3-103).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ,aFigure 3-101APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,\\'aFigure 3-102APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,aFigure 3-100APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,\\'aFigure 3-103Basic GPS Operation3-34Basic GPS OperationChapter 35.Use right outer and inner knobs as in the previous steps until the desired identifier is completely displayed (figure 3-104).6.Press  to display the waypointpage for the selected waypoint (figure 3-105).7.Press  again to approve thedisplayed waypoint page.  The  screen will change to the NAV 1  page, and the selected waypoint will now be the active Direct To waypoint (figure 3-106).àNOTE:In some cases duringapproach operations, the KLN 89B presents a page asking how a way- point is used when the waypoint identifier is entered character by char-acter. When this page is presented, simply choose the desired use of the waypoint (e.g. FAF or MAHP) by moving the cursor with the right outer knob and pressing . Choosing the correct use of the way-point is required to ensure proper waypoint sequencing once the aircraft reaches the waypoint.To fly Direct To a waypoint (procedure 2):1.Select the desired waypoint page (APT, VOR, NDB, INT, or SUP) on the screen (figure 3-107) using one of the three procedures  explained in section 3.7.2.Press  . The Direct To page isdisplayed and it contains the desired waypoint identifier (figure 3-108).3.Press  .

CANCELLING A DIRECT TOThe primary reason for wanting to cancel Direct To operation is to return to flight plan operation which is described later in section 4.2.4 ÒCombining Direct To and Flight Plan OperationÓ.To cancel Direct To operation: 1.Press  .  2.Press  to blank out the way-point identifier field (figure 3-109).3.Press  .3.9.3. WAYPOINT ALERTING FOR DIRECT TO OPERATION Approximately 36 seconds prior to reaching a Direct To waypoint, thearrow preceding the waypoint identifier on the waypoint page for the active waypoint will begin flashing.  This arrow will also be flashing on  any NAV or FPL page displaying the active waypoint identifier.  This  is called Òwaypoint alertingÓ.  If an external waypoint alert (WPT)  annunciator is mounted in the aircraft, this annunciator will begin flashing at the same time.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ,55555aaFigure 3-1093.10. NAVIGATION PAGES As you would expect, the NAV (navigation) pages contain informationrelating specifically to the KLN 89(B)Õs navigation capabilities.  The  KLN 89(B) has four NAV pages.  The procedure for selecting specific  pages, including the NAV pages, was described in section 3.4.1,  ÒPage SelectionÓ.3.10.1.THE NAVIGATION 1 (NAV 1) PAGE  The NAV 1 page is the primarynavigation display, and is shown in  figure 3-110.  In normal flight, you will  probably rely on this page quite a lot. A NAV 1 page displays the following information:Line 1:The active navigation leg.  For Direct To operation this con- sists of the Direct To symbol, XXY Y, followed by the active Direct Towaypoint identifier (figure 3-110).  For  the leg of a flight plan this consists of the ÒfromÓ waypoint identifier and the active ÒtoÓ waypoint identifier     (figure  3-111).  An arrow  YYprecedes theactive waypoint identifier.Line 2:A cyclic field which can either be (1) a course deviation indicator (CDI) that graphically displays left and right deviation from desired course (figure 3-111), (2) The direction to fly to intercept thedesired track and the crosstrack distance (figure 3-112), or (3) the current CDI scale in use. This is a  cyclic field, so you can change back and forth between the three options by turning on the cursor () overthe second line and pressing the button.The CDIÕs vertical bar operates like a navigation deviation needle ona conventional CDI or HSI using VOR/Localizer navigation.  An on-  course indication is displayed when the vertical deviation bar is centered on the triangle in the middle of the CDI.  In en route use,  each dot represents one nautical mile deviation from the desired  track. Different CDI scales are used during terminal and non-preci- sion approach flight with KLN 89B. For now, letÕs talk only about en route operations.  A vertical deviation bar positioned two dots to the Basic GPS Operation3-36Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-112APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-110APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-111KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-37Basic GPS OperationChapter 3right of the center triangle indicates the aircraft is two nautical miles tothe left of course (figure 3-113). The center triangle also serves asthe CDIÕs TO/FROM indicator andoperates in the same manner as a conventional CDI TO/FROM indica- tor; a triangle pointing up indicates  ÒtoÓ the active waypoint while a  ÒdownÓ triangle (figure 3-114) indicates ÒfromÓ the active waypoint. The word FLAGis displayed over theCDI when the KLN 89(B) is not  usable for navigation (figure 3-115).The numerical crosstrack distancedisplay is especially handy when more than five nautical miles off of course (naturally, you yourself would never deviate more than five nm off  course, but not everyone is as good a pilot as you are!)  If your crosstrack  distance was 13.1 nautical miles left of course, the graphic CDI needle will be pegged on the right side (which doesnÕt tell you much).  But this  presentation will show you exactly how far off course you are (figure 3-116).  When the KLN 89(B)  is not usable for navigation, the crosstrack distance will be dashed out (figure 3-117).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-114APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-115KBGR KAUG2 NMAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH `\\\\MHHH Figure 3-113APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-117APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-116Basic GPS Operation3-38Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Line 3:Magnetic desired track, and magnetic actual track (seeAppendix A for navigation terms). In normal on-course flight, it is desirable to steer the aircraft to keep these two numbers equal.Line 4:A cyclic field which can display either bearing to the activewaypoint (To), radial from the active waypoint ( Fr), or the VNAV sta-tus, which will either by Off, Armed, time until VNAV begins, or thesuggested VNAV altitude (see section 4.4).  By placing the cursor  over this field and pressing the button, you may toggle betweenthe three options.NOTE:Due to Ògreat circleÓ courses and magnetic variation differ-ences between present position and the active waypoint, the To bearing and From radial may not be exactly 180¡different from each  other when the system is in the Leg mode.  This condition is most  likely to occur when long distances are involved, and/or you are operating in very northerly or southerly latitudes.  See figure 3-118 for  an example depicting a case like this. The aircraft is somewhere over Georgia, and the active waypoint is KPHX. The bearing to steer is 269¡, and radial is 72¡. Generally, you will want to use bearing (not radial) when long distances are involved.Line 4 also displays the estimated time en route (ETE) from present position to active waypoint.NNKPHX72269Figure 3-118KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-39Basic GPS OperationChapter 33.10.2.THE NAVIGATION 2 (NAV 2) PAGE The NAV 2 pages in figures 3-119 and 3-120 display the aircraftÕs  present position in one of two  formats.  The first line is a cyclic field  which allows you to toggle between formats.  When the NAV 2 page is  first displayed, it defaults to present  position in terms of the radial and distance from a nearby VOR.  You  can change the reference waypoint from the nearby VOR to any  waypoint.To change the NAV 2 page present position reference waypoint:1.With the NAV 2 page on the radial and distance from a  reference waypoint format, turn on the cursor () and move itto the Ref:field (figure 3-121).2.Use the right inner and outer knobs to enter the waypoint you wish to use as a reference.3.Press  .  The waypoint page for the identifier just entered will be displayed.4.If this is the waypoint you intend- ed, press again.  The display will return to the NAV 2 page (figure 3-122).NOTE:If you change the reference waypoint, change to a page other than the NAV 2 page, then turn back to the NAV 2 page, the reference waypoint will revert back to a nearby VOR.By turning on the cursor () over the first line and pressing ,you can change to the latitude and longitude format.NOTE:Your present position may be stored as a user-defined way-point by pressing  while viewing the NAV 2 page.

The time zone may be  changed by turning the cursor ()on over it and turning the right inner knob.  All times shown on the  NAV 3 page are in terms of the system time zone (except for the flight time, which is an elapsed time).Line 2:The time of departure.  This is the time when a valid ground- speed was first greater than 30 knots (typically during takeoff).Line 3:Estimated time of arrival at your destination.  If the active waypoint is not part of the active flight plan, the active waypoint will be the destination.  Otherwise, the last waypoint in your active flight  plan will be the destination.Line 4:The elapsed flight time, which will be the hours and minutessince the departure time.3.10.4.THE NAVIGATION 4 (NAV 4) PAGE  The NAV 4 page is a graphical moving map which offers excellent ÒbirdÕs-eye-viewÓ situational awareness to you as the pilot in com- mand.  This page can show you where you are and where youÕre  headed relative to your active flight plan or leg, your destination way- point(s), the nearby airports and VORs, and even the boundaries of nearby special use airspace!The NAV 4 page (figure 3-124) is alittle bit different than some of the other KLN 89(B) pages.  Instead of  displaying the page type and number (i.e. NAV 4) in the lower left corner of the screen, an additional piece of nav- igation data is displayed here.  WeÕre  willing to bet youÕll know this is the  NAV 4 page anyway, because of its unique graphics.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-123APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-124KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-41Basic GPS OperationChapter 3The left side of the screen displays the distance to go, active way-point identifier, and mode annunciation (either Leg, or the OBSselected course), just like it usually would, but the fourth line is a cyclic field for which you may select:Magnetic Desired Track (degrees)DTK123Groundspeed (knots or kilometers/hour)123ktEstimated Time Enroute (hours:minutes)1:23Crosstrack Correction1.21YYNOTE:Magnetic desired track may only be selected whenKLN 89(B) is in the Leg navigation mode.  When the KLN 89(B) is in  the OBS mode, the Òdesired trackÓ is the same as the OBS selected course displayed on line 3.To change the data displayed in thiscyclic field, simply turn on the cursor (), rotate the right inner knob counterclockwise to position the cur- sor over this field (figure 4-125), and press the button to choose thedesired information.Now we move on to the map display area on the right side of the screen.  In all KLN 89(B) installations there are three common map  orientation formats that may be selected on the NAV 4 page: a True North up display, a desired track up display, or an actual track up dis- play.  In addition, if the KLN 89(B) is interfaced with a source of  heading in a compatible format then a heading up presentation may also be selected.  When the North up display is selected, viewing the  NAV 4 page is like looking at a navigation chart with North at the top. When the desired track up display is selected the NAV 4 page is like looking at a chart that is turned so that your course line is always pointing up.  When the actual track up display is selected, viewing the  NAV 4 page is like looking at a chart that is turned so that the direction the aircraft is tracking over the ground is pointing up.  In a  no-wind condition, actual track is identical to the aircraftÕs heading.CAUTION:  When using the actual track up format it is typical for there to be a slight delay from the time a heading change is made until the correct map orientation is displayed.  Be careful  when using either the desired track up display or the actual track up display to not think that a heading up display is being used.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  (Figure 3-125Basic GPS Operation3-42Basic GPS OperationChapter 3When you are navigating with a flight plan (see section 4.2), the NAV4 page displays the waypoints of the active flight plan (FPL 0) with their waypoint identifiers (figure 3-125). Course lines connect the flight plan waypoints.When operating Direct To a waypointwhich is not in the active flight plan, the direct to waypoint is shown on the map, and although the waypoints of  the active flight plan are still shown onthe screen, they are not connected by course lines (figure 3-126).In the lower left corner of the map dis-play area is the map range scale in nautical miles.  The range scale indi-  cates the distance from the aircraftÕs position to the top of the screen.  You  may select a range scale of 1 NM to  500 NM (2 km to 925 km) with several choices in between by turning on the cursor (), and using the rightinner knob to select the desired range scale.  For example, figure 3-  127 illustrates the results of changing the range scale of the map in figure 3-126 from 60 nautical miles to 30 nautical miles.Additionally, there is a choice called AUTO, for automatic range scal-ing.  This choice is sandwiched between the 1 NM (2 km) scale and  the 500 NM (925 km) scale, such that it is ÒbelowÓ 1 NM (2 km) and ÒaboveÓ 500 NM (925 km).  The AUTO scale factor feature ÒzoomsÓ  the map in and out in a useful way so that you donÕt have to.  Specifically, AUTO chooses the smallest map scale that will display the active waypoint and, if there is one, the waypoint after the activewaypoint.  Choosing the AUTO scale  factor means there is one less item for you to worry about.  This is espe-  cially helpful when conducting non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B.Aside from changing the map range scale, all other customization ofthe map display is done from the menu.  Notice that when you turn on the cursor (), the Menu?fieldappears above the range scale.  Turn  the right outer knob one step counter- clockwise to move the cursor over the Menu?field (figure 3-128) and press.  The menu now Òpops-upÓ on the screen (figure 3-129).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-126APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-127APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-128APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  :=\",˘ˇˆ,.CC \"+@,.CC Figure 3-129KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-43Basic GPS OperationChapter 3To select the desired NAV 4 orienta-tion, you must first select the menu,  then use the right outer knob to posi- tion the cursor over the map  orientation field (figure 3-130).  Rotate the right inner knob to display NforNorth up, DTKfor desired track up(figure 3-131), TKfor actual track up, or HDGfor heading up.  The heading up selection is not presented as a choice if heading is not provided to the KLN 89(B).  If the cursor is  located on a field other than the map orientation field, then the DTK, TK,or HDGannunciation is replacedwith the actual value. The  123¡dis-played in figure 3-132 shows how the actual track is displayed when the  cursor is not over the map orientation field.If a heading input is available to the KLN 89(B) then heading up isusually the best map orientation to select.  Otherwise, actual track up  display is usually preferred for use in flight.  However, the track up  display is only usable when the aircraft is moving 2 knots or more so the North up display may be a good choice if you are stationary.Notice that in both the North up format and the desired track up for-mat, the aircraftÕs position is depicted by a diamond.  In the actual  track up format and the heading up format, the aircraftÕs position is depicted by an aircraft symbol.You may choose to have nearby airports, VORs, and special use air-space (SUA) displayed on the moving map!  To do so, use the  pop-up menu by turning on the cursor and selecting Menu?.When the menu is first displayed the cursor will be on the SUA selec-tion field.  Rotate the right inner knob to select  onor off. When SUAsare selected, the five nearest SUAs are displayed.  However, they will not be displayed on map range scales larger than 160 NM (300 km). Special use airspace areas are displayed regardless of your altitude relative to the airspace.  The nearest SUA feature (section 3.8.2) and  the SUA alerting feature (section 3.17) will indicate the altitude limits of the airspace to you. Section 3.17 will also help you understand more about the KLN 89(B) special use airspace features as well as the types of SUA that are included in the KLN 89(B) data base.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  :=\",˘ˇˆ,.CC \"+@,.CC aYFigure 3-130APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  :=\",˘ˇˆ,.CC \"+@,.CC aYFigure 3-131APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  :=\",˘ˇˆ,.CC \"+@,.CC Figure 3-132Basic GPS Operation3-44Basic GPS OperationChapter 3NOTE:Only the outer lateral boundaries are displayed for Class B,Class C, CTA, and TMA airspace.

The example in figure 3-133 shows SUAs and airports having been selected.When the desired selections havebeen made, press the button toremove the menu from the screen (figure 3-134).  Notice that the nearest  airports are depicted with a small +symbol, while the VORs are shown as a small box ().One last item of interest on this page: you may change the activewaypoint to any of the flight plan waypoints without having to leave the map display.  This is done by pulling the right inner knob to the  ÒoutÓ or ÒscanÓ position.  This will cause the identifier for the active  waypoint to be displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen(figure 3-135).  The waypoint  displayed in this area will be the default waypoint when ispressed.  By turning the right inner  knob it is possible to scan through the waypoints of the active flight plan  (FPL 0).  Turning the knob clockwise  will scan through the waypoints in sequence until the end of the flight plan is reached.  Turning the knob counter-clockwise will scan  through the active flight plan in reverse order until the beginning of the flight plan is reached.  Pushing the right inner knob back to the  ÒinÓ position will remove this text from the map display area.The following hints will make using the NAV 4 page more enjoyable.¥It is easy to clutter the display with so much data that it is unus- able.

Airports which have one of these categories of  frequencies also have APR and DEP which are IFR frequencies.Where required, APR, DEP, CL B, CL C, CTA, and TMA frequenciesare sectorized.  That is, a frequency may be used only within a cer-  tain range of radials from a designated reference location.  The  format for displaying the sectorization is to show the frequency first, followed by the identifier of the associated reference point, followed next by the associated altitude restrictions.  For example, figure 3-  144 shows that the Orlando approach control frequency 121.10 MHz is used between the 311¡radial and the 60¡  radial from KMCO (Orlando International Airport) for altitudes at and below 5500 feet.In a few cases, APR, DEP, CL B, CL C, CTA, and TMA frequenciesare sectorized such that the restrictions cannot be displayed on a sin- gle page.

ALTITUDE PAGES The ALT (altitude) pages are used to control and display most of the altitude-related functions of the KLN 89(B), including minimum safe alti-  tudes and vertical navigation (VNAV).  The ALT pages are accessed  by pressing the button.  The first time the  button is pressed,the ALT 1 page is displayed (figure 3-169).  If the  button is pressedagain while the ALT 1 page is dis-  played, the display changes to the ALT 2 page.  Pressing  a third time goes back to the page which you were on before you changed to the ALT pages.NOTE:For a detailed discussion of the ALT 2 page, see section 4.4,ÒAdvisory VNAV OperationÓ.The ALT 1 page is used to set the current barometric pressure or Òbaro settingÓ.  Since all encoding altimeters and some air data computers  output pressure altitude, it is often required that you manually input the  proper baro setting in order to get accurate altitude functions.  The KLN  89(B) functions which use the altitude input are special use airspace  (SUA) alerting, altitude alerting, and vertical navigation (VNAV).  It is a  good idea to update the altimeter baro setting on the ALT 1 page each  time you make a change to the aircraftÕs altimeter setting.To Change the Baro Setting: 1.Press  .  The ALT 1 page will be displayed with the cursor over the altimeter baro setting field (figure 3-169).NOTE: The SET 8 page (figure 3-170)is used to set the unit of measure for  various parameters. The altimeter barometric setting can be set to inches of Mercury (Ò), millibars (mB), or hec-  topascals (hP). Altitude, airport elevation, and runway lengths can be set to feet (ft) or meters (m). Finally, distances and velocities can be set to nautical miles (nm) and knots (kt) or kilometers (km) and kilometers/hour (k/h). To change a unit of mea- sure: select the SET 8 page; turn on the cursor (CRSR) and move it  over the desired unit of measure using the right outer knob; turn the right inner knob to select the desired unit of measure;  and turn the cur-  sor off again. This format for the SET 8 page applies to ORS 02 software. ORS 01 software only allows the selection of barometric set-  ting units.

This altitude is derived by Jeppesen for sectors which are  one degree of latitude by one degree of longitude in size.  One degree  of latitude is 60 nautical miles.  One degree of longitude is 60 nautical  miles at the equator and progressively less than 60 nautical miles as one travels away from the equator.  One degree of longitude is approx-  imately 50 nautical miles at the southern most parts of the U.S. and is  approximately 40 nautical miles at the northern most parts of the U.S.  The MSA altitude information is contained in the data base and is  updateed when the data base cartridge is updated.The minimum safe altitude (MSA) provides Òreference pointÓ clearance within these one degree latitude by one degree longitude sectors. Jeppesen defines a reference point as Òa natural (Peak, Knoll, Hill, etc.)  or man-made (Tower, Stack, Tank, Building, etc.) objectÓ. Jeppesen states the following about the Grid Minimum Off-Route altitude:  ÒGrid  MORA values clear all reference points by 1000 feet in areas where  the highest reference points are 5000 feet MSL or lower. MORA values  clear all reference points by 2000 feet in areas where the highest refer-  ence points are 5001 feet MSL or higherÓ.  The KLN 89(B) displays  dashes for areas outside the data base coverage area or for areas where the Grid MORA is not defined.Line 4 displays the Minimum Enroute Safe Altitude (ESA).IMPORTANT:When the KLN 89(B) is in the Leg mode, the minimum enroute safe altitude is the highest MSA sector altitude from the pre-  sent position to the active waypoint, then to the destination waypoint along the active flight plan.

VIEWING AND SETTING THE DATE AND TIME The KLN 89(B) system time and date should seldom, if ever, require updating because they are automatically updated when at least one satellite is received.  In addition, the KLN 89(B) contains an internal  battery powered calendar/clock to keep system time and date when the unit is not being used.  You will normally check to make sure the KLN  89(B) is set to the correct  time and date shortly after you turn the unit  on while you verify the Self Test Page.  You can, however, also check  the time and date on the Setup (SET) 2 page anytime you desire. There are several pages as well as some internal functions of the KLN 89(B), such as magnetic variation and proper use of data base informa- tion, that depend on having the proper time and date.NOTE:You will not be able to update the time or date if the KLN 89(B) is receiving a time and date from a satellite.To set the date on the SET 2 page: 1.Select the SET 2 page (figure 3- 173).2.Turn on the cursor.  The cursor will be over the entire date field (figure 3-174).3.Select the correct day of the month with the right inner knob.4.Move the flashing part of the cursor to the month field (middle three dashes) with the right outer knob, and select the proper month  (figure 3-175).5.Move the flashing part of the cursor to the tens digit of the year  field, and select the proper number (figure 3-176).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-175APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-173APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-174KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-61Basic GPS OperationChapter 36.Repeat step 5 for the ones digit of the year field.7.Press  to start the KLN 89(B)using the newly entered date (figure 3-177).To set the time on the SET 2 page: 1.Select the SET 2 page if it is not already selected.2.Turn on the cursor and move it to the time zone field (figure 3-178).3.Change the time zone with the right inner knob, if desired   (figure  3-179).  A listing of the time zones  and their abbreviations is con- tained in section 3.2,  ÒTurn-on andSelf TestÓ.4.Move the cursor to the time field. The hours and minutes will appear  in inverse video.5.Select the correct hour        (figure 3-180).  Remember, the KLN  89(B) uses 24 hour time.  If it is  1:00 P.M. or later, add 12 hours (for example, 2:30 P.M. becomes  14:30).6.Move the flashing part of the cursor to the tens of minutes,  select the proper number    (figure  3-181), then move on to the last digit and set it.7.Press  to start the clockrunning (figure 3-182).

This includes which satellites are being tracked, the  satellitesÕ health, the signal strength for each of these satellites, the elevation of each satellite above the horizon, the azimuth of each  satellite referenced to your present position, the estimated position error, and the present GPS-derived altitude.The GPS receiver in the KLN 89(B) is capable of using signals fromup to eight satellites to determine its position.  A valid position may be  determined using as few as four satellites alone or three satellites with a valid electronic altitude input.  However, four satellites alone or  three satellites with an altitude input do not necessarily ensure that navigation can take place.  The satellites must be positioned relative  to your location such that sufficient ÒgeometryÓ exists to determine an accurate position. The satellite constellation geometry is continually changing as each satellite, ÒrisesÓ, travels across the sky, andeventually ÒsetsÓ relative to your position.  The GPS satellites are not in geosynchronous orbits positioned over the same spot on earth at all times like some television communication satellites with which you may be familiar.  Rather, the GPS satellites are in orbits that allow  them to circle the earth about two times each day.A representative OTH 1 page is shown in figure 3-183.  The OTH 1  page displays the GPS receiver state and the systemÕs estimate of the posi-tion error expressed in nautical miles or kilometers.The GPS state is indicated on line 1.  The possibilities are:INITinitializationACQacquisitionTRANtransitionNAVnavigationNAV Anavigation with altitude aidingNAV Dnavigation with data collectionDEGRDnavigation with position degradationFAILRreceiver failureAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-183KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-63Basic GPS OperationChapter 3In the initialization state the GPS receiver is in the process ofinitializing itself, collecting information such as the date, time, and last present position.  Next, the receiver collects data from its own  memory to determine which satellites should be visible.  After  completing the initialization process the receiver begins the  acquisition process.  During this time, the visible satellites are being  acquired and data is obtained from them.The transition state indicates an adequate number of satellites fornavigation has been acquired and is being tracked but no position data can yet be produced.Normal navigation is indicated by a NAV, NAV A, or NAV DGPSstate.  NAV Aindicates that the altitude input is being used in the position solution.  NAV Dindicates that besides calculation position,the receiver is collecting and storing in its memory additional data from the satellites (called ephemeris and almanac data).Line 2 of the OTH 1 page displays the present GPS-derived altitude,that is, the altitude that is being indicated by the GPS position solution.WARNING: Do not use the GPS-derived altitude for navigation. Due to Selective Availability position degradation and other fac-  tors, the GPS altitude is normally 300 feet or more in error, which is unacceptable for vertical navigation.Lines 3 and 4 of the OTH 1 page dis-play the KLN 89(B)Õs estimatedposition error.  The KLN 89(B) Õs posi-tion error depends upon such factors as the number of satellites being received, the strength of the GPS sig- nals, and the geometry of the  satellites presently being used for navigation.Figures 3-184, 3-185 and 3-186 showa representative example of a set of OTH 2 pages.  There will be three  OTH 2 pages if more than six satellites are being received as in this example. The following information is displayed for each satellite on the OTH 2 pages:APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-184APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-185APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-186Basic GPS Operation3-64Basic GPS OperationChapter 3¥The specific GPS satellites or Òspace vehiclesÓ (SV) beingreceived are displayed in the left column.  Each satellite has its  own identification number.  A * symbol to the right of the satellite  number indicates this particular satellite is not presently being  tracked by the receiver.NOTE:At some times, you may desire to deselect certain satellites ifyou know them to be inaccurate, so that they are not used to deter- mine the GPS position. Should a satellite be inaccurate, it could cause a RAIM failure, rendering the system unusable for primary IFR  navigation. To deselect a specific satellite, turn on the cursor ()and move it over the desired SV number (figure 3-187). Turn the right inner knob to deselect (or reselect) the desired satellite.¥The satelliteÕs ÒhealthÓ (Hlt) is indicated to the right of the satellitenumber.  The health of the satellite can be described as  GdforGood, Wkfor Weak, and Bdfor Bad.   Dsindicates the satellitewas deselected by the pilot.  Fdindicates the receiver detected afault and excluded that satellite.¥The signal strength (Sg) for each satellite is displayed next andindicates the signal strength for each satellite in the range of 0 (zero) to 9 (nine).

REMOTE MOUNTED ANNUNCIATORS The KLN 89(B) has outputs capable of driving two remote annunciator lights: waypoint alert and message.  Although these annunciators are  optional, it is desirable to have them mounted in the  pilotÕs normal scan area so that these annunciatorsare easily seen.  A typical annunciator is shown in  figure 3-197; however, actual annunciation abbrevi- ations and configurations may be different.The remote waypoint alert annunciator is on whenever waypointalerting is occurring.  See sections 3.9.3,  ÒWaypoint Alerting for DirectTo OperationÓ and 4.2.2, ÒTurn Anticipation and Waypoint AlertingÓ.The remote message annunciator is on whenever the messageprompt  is on.

It  gives you a digital readout of the voltage supplied to your avionics, down to tenths of volts.  You will find this feature valuable as an extra  layer of security in cases of electrical or charging system problems.A voltage alert feature is also available on this page, to warn you ofan electrical system problem, regardless of whether you are viewing the SET 10 page or not.  It is set up so that the avionics bus voltage  must drop below the alert limit for a certain length of time.  This time  delay is so that brief power interruptions don\\'t trigger the voltage alert.The alert voltage and the alert delay are set at the time of installationand stored in the KLN 89(B) configuration module.  As the pilot, your  two options are to have the voltage alert disabled, or to have it enabled with the predefined voltage and time delay values.To enable the voltage alert feature: 1.Select the SET 10 page (figure 3-198) and turn on the cursor ().2.Turn the right inner knob to enable the alert feature.  The  alert voltage and alert delay will be displayed on lines 2 and 3 (figure 3-199).3.Turn off the cursor ( ).If the avionics bus voltage dropsbelow the alert voltage for the speci- fied delay time, the message*Low Bus VoltageCheck Charging Systemwill be displayed.  This message may be indicative of a problem with the aircraft\\'s charging system.

You may desire to turn off some of the aircraft\\'s electrical devices which are non-essential for your particular phase(s) of flight, so that the battery will not discharge as quickly.Appropriate alert voltage and alert delays will vary from aircraft to air- craft.  If your KLN 89(B) is frequently giving you this alert message, it  may become a nuisance, and you may desire to have your  Honeywell Service Center adjust the voltage alert parameters.3.17.SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE ALERTING The KLN 89(B) data base contains the location of areas of special  use airspace (SUA).  The types of SUA areas stored in the data base  and the abbreviations used to denote these areas are the following:Class BCL BClass CCL CControl Area (used outside USA)CTATerminal Area (used outside USA)TMAAlert AreaALRTCaution AreaCAUTDanger AreaDNGRMilitary Operations AreaMOAProhibited AreaPROHRestricted AreaRESTTraining AreaTRNGWarning AreaWARNTerminal Radar Service AreaTRSAThe KLN 89(B) will normally alert youprior to entering one of these areas with a message prompt.  When the  Message page is viewed it will display Airspace Alert and will also display the name and type of the special use airspace (figure 3-200).  If the special  use airspace is a Class B, Class C, CTA, or TMA, the message page will also instruct you to press the but-ton if you wish to see the Airport 5 page (airport communications) for the primary airport so that the correct communications frequency may be determined (figure 3-201).Basic GPS Operation3-68Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-200APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-201NOTE:In addition to the message page messages that alert you tospecial use airspace, the KLN 89(B) can also display the five nearest areas of SUA.  It will even give you the direction and distance to the  nearest edge of the SUA.  See section 3.8.2 for more details.The SUA alert feature is three dimensional.  The SUA areas are stored in the KLN 89(B) data base with regard to altitude when the actual SUA altitude limitations are charted in terms of mean sea level (MSL).  Therefore, if you are flying either above or below an SUA  area you wonÕt be inconvenienced with nuisance alert messages.However, if the actual lower limit of an SUA is charted in terms of an altitude above ground level (AGL), then it is stored in the KLN 89(B) as all altitude below the upper limit of the SUA.  If the actual upper  limit of an SUA is charted in terms of AGL, it is stored in the KLN 89(B) as ÒunlimitedÓ.If the altitude input to the KLN 89(B) is pressure altitude from an alti- tude encoder or air data computer, then you must manually update the KLN 89(B) with an altimeter setting (baro correction in order to receive accurate SUA alerting. You may easily update the altimeter setting by pressing the button todisplay the Altitude 1 (ALT 1) page  (figure 3-202) The right inner knob is used to change the altimeter setting. When the setting is complete, press twice to return to the page previ-ously in view.CAUTION:  Failure to keep the altimeter baro setting updated will result in inaccurate special use airspace alerting. If this fea-  ture is used, it is a good idea to update the altimeter baro setting on the ALT 1 page each time you make a change to an aircraftÕs  altimeter setting.NOTE:If there is no altitude input to the KLN 89(B), all altitudes willbe regarded as being within the boundary of the SUA area.Only the outer lateral boundaries are stored for Class B, Class C, CTA, and TMA airspace.  These SUA areas are stored as  ÒcylindersÓof airspace so all altitudes below the upper limit of these areas are considered to be in the SUA.The message prompt for a special use airspace alert will occur whenthe aircraftÕs position is at a point such that a projection of the air- craftÕs existing track over the ground is approximately 10 minutesfrom penetrating the outer boundary of one of these areas.  It will alsoKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-69Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH \"!;!#L  Figure 3-202occur if the aircraft iswithin approximately two nautical miles of one of these areas even if the aircraftÕs projected trackover the ground wonÕtactually penetrate the SUA area (figure 3-203). If one of the SUA areas is penetrated, another message will state: Inside SUA.The SUA alert feature may be disabled (or enabled) on the Setup 7(SET 7) page, shown in figure 3-204. Select the SET 7 page, turn on the cursor ().  The right inner knob is used to choose between SUA ALERTENABLEDand SUA ALERT DIS-ABLED.If the SUA alert feature has beenenabled, the KLN 89(B) allows you to select a vertical buffer on the SET 7 page in order to provide an additional layer of protection from inadvertently entering an SUA.  To select a vertical  buffer, make sure the SUA alert fea- ture has been enabled.  Turn on the  cursor () (figure 3-205) and thenuse the right inner knob to select the buffer (figure 3-206).  The buffer may  be selected in one hundred foot or ten meter increments.  After the desired  selection has been made, turn the off.The vertical buffer serves to ÒstretchÓ the SUA area in both directions (up and down) by the selected buffer altitude.  For example, let Õs sayyou have selected a buffer of 1,000 feet and the actual SUA area  exists from 5,000 feet MSL to 12,000 feet MSL.  In this case you will  receive SUA alert messages if you fly at any altitude between 4,000 and 13,000 feet MSL.Basic GPS Operation3-70Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-204APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   ˛˛#Figure 3-205APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   ˛$˛Figure 3-20610 MIN2 MILESFigure 3-203CAUTION:  It is the pilotÕs responsibility to avoid those areas of special use airspace where ATC clearance to penetrate is required but has not been obtained.

Our  trip will be from Adams field (KLIT) in Little Rock, Arkansas to Mueller  Municipal airport (KAUS) in Austin, Texas.  The weather is perfect  and we decide to make trip VFR and fly direct to Austin.3.18.1  PRE-DEPARTURE  1. Apply power to the KLN 89(B) by turning the power knob to the ON position.2.Verify that the information on the Self Test and Initialization pages is correct, including the time and date.  Enter the altimeter  baro setting.  Position the cursor over  Ok?and press toapprove the Initialization page.3. Read the Data Base page and acknowledge it by pressing  .4. The APT 5 page for Adams field ( KLIT), which shows the com-munications frequencies, is now displayed on the screen since KLITwas the active waypoint when you last removed power fromthe  KLN 89(B).  The first APT 5 page indicates that the ATIS fre-  quency is 125.65 MHz, the pre-taxi clearance delivery frequency is 118.95 MHz, and the ground control frequency is 121.90 MHz. After listening to ATIS, we contact clearance delivery for our  clearance out of the Little Rock Class C airspace.  Next, we give  ground control a call and receive our taxi clearance.5. By this time the KLN 89(B) has reached a NAV ready status.  We can verify this by turning to the NAV 2 page.  It shows a valid  present position, in this case 3.8 nautical miles on the 320 degree radial from Little Rock (LIT) VOR.6. Press to bring up the Direct To page.

Press  . The APT 1 page for Mueller Municipal is now dis- played on the screen.8.Press  again to approve the waypoint page.  The NAV 1 page is now displayed.  The NAV 1 page indicates it is 384  nautical miles to Austin and that the bearing is 225 degrees. After take-off, the NAV 1 page will also display groundspeed and estimated time en route.3.18.2 EN ROUTE  1. We depart from runway 36 at Little Rock and are told to  Òmaintainrunway heading.Ó  After several radar vectors for traffic avoidancewe are finally cleared on course. The D-Bar indicates that the  radar vectors have taken us north of the original course and we decide to proceed Direct To Austin from our present position. To recenter the D-Bar, press , and then press .2. In order to determine the minimum enroute safe altitude (ESA) for our flight, you view the ALT 1 page by pressing the button. It indicates an ESA of 4300 feet for the trip and a minimum safe altitude for our present position of 3400 feet.3. After departure control has directed  Òsquawk 1200, frequencychange approved,Ó you decide it would be a good idea to obtain VFR flight following. To obtain the frequency for Center, press the button, move the cursor to the CTR?selection, andpress .  The KLN 89(B) indicates that for our position, we should be able to contact Memphis Center on 118.85 MHz.4. WeÕve only flown about 100 nautical miles, but we begin wonder-ing where we would go if an engine suddenly started running rough.  We decide to use the KLN 89(B) to determine where the  nearest airports are from our present location. To view the near-  est airports press , and then press . The nearest airport isHope Municipal (M18) which is eight nautical miles from our posi-tion on a bearing to the airport of 11 degrees.  You now rotate the right inner knob to view the other APT pages for Hope Municipal. We learn, for example, that it is located in Hope, Arkansas, and  has two hard surface runways that are each 5500 feet in length. By pulling the right inner knob to the ÒoutÓ position, you may now scan clockwise through the remaining eight airports in the nearest airport list.Basic GPS Operation3-72Basic GPS OperationChapter 35. For the majority of the en route portion of the flight, you select the NAV 4 pageÕs moving map display.  Pressing the right  button, you select the 30 nautical mile range scale using the right inner knob.  Moving the cursor to  Menu?And pressing brings up the display menu on the screen.  You then use the right knobs to select APT:onand SUA:onso that nearby airports andspecial use airspace (SUA) are shown on the moving map display.  While the menu is displayed, select the track up map  orientation (TKcc) as well,  Pressing the  button againremoves the menu from the screen.6. Since it is a good idea to not rely on just one navigation source, you suggest we cross check the KLN 89(B) position against other equipment in the aircraft.  The NAV 2 page indicates we are  presently located on the Texarkana (TXK) VOR 68 degree radialat a distance of 19 nautical miles.  By tuning our NAV receiver  and DME to TXK, we are able to confirm that this is the correct position.3.18.3  TERMINAL AREA  1. About 50 nautical miles from Austin Õs Mueller airport we startpreparing four our arrival.  Viewing the APT 5 page for  KAUSyou determine that the ATIS frequency is 119.20 MHz and tower is 121.00 MHz.2. A few minutes later, the message prompt begins flashing.  When you press , the message page advises Airspace Alert -Austin CL C - Below 4600 ft - See KAUS freq-Press CLR.The Special Use Airspace Alert feature has determined that you are within 10 minutes of penetrating the Austin Class C airspace. When you press and view the APT 5 page for KAUS, yousee that the Class C airspace frequencies are sectorized.  You  determine from the APT 5 page that the proper frequency to use  is 124.90 MHz since we are Northeast of Austin and 124.90 MHz is the appropriate frequency to use from 3 degrees to 170 degrees.  You turn to the NAV 4 page so that we can see the  outer boundary of the Austin Class C airspace relative to our location and route.3. After you call Austin approach control for clearance into the Class C airspace, you view the rest of the APT pages for KAUS to determine the field elevation and available runways.4. After landing, the KLN 89(B) is turned off either by rotating the KLN 89(B) power knob to OFF, or with the avionics master switch if one is installed.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-73Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Basic GPS Operation3-74Basic GPS OperationChapter 3This page intentionally left blank 4.ADVANCED GPS OPERATION 4.1. CREATING AND MODIFYING FLIGHT PLANS The following rules and considerations apply to KLN 89(B) flightplans:¥The KLN 89(B) is capable of storing in its memory 25 flight plansplus an active flight plan.¥Each of the flight plans may contain up to 20 waypoints.  The waypoints may consist of any combination of published waypoints from the data base or user created waypoints. The  active flight plan may contain up to 35 waypoints if it includes  approach and SID/STAR waypoints.¥The flight plans are numbered 0 through 25 (FPL 0, FPL 1, FPL2, . . . , FPL 25).¥The active flight plan is alwaysFPL 0.  The standard procedure is to create a flight plan using one of the flight plans numbered as FPL 1, FPL 2, etc. When one of these numbered flight plans is activated, it becomes FPL 0, the active flight plan. This PilotÕsGuide will refer to FPL 0 as the  Òactive flight plan Ó and FPL 1 through FPL 25 as the Ònumbered flight plans.Ó  If desired, a flight plan can be created directly in the active flight plan. This avoids creating the flight plan in a numbered flight plan and then having to activate it. The disadvantage is that if a numbered flight plan is subsequently made active, the one programmed directly into FPL 0 will be lost.¥Modifications may be made to FPL 0 without affecting the way itis stored as a numbered flight plan.¥Unless Direct To operation is being used, the active flight plan(FPL 0) must contain at least two waypoints.  Otherwise, the  KLN 89(B) navigation system will be flagged.4.1.1. CREATING A FLIGHT PLAN  A flight plan for a flight from Lakefront airport in New Orleans, LA to St. Petersburg/Clearwater, FL  International airport will be used as an  example of how to create a flight plan.  The waypoints making up the  flight plan are:  KNEW(Lakefront airport), GPT(Gulfport VOR), SJI(Semmes VOR),  CEW(Crestview VOR), MAI(Marianna VOR), TLH(Tallahassee VOR), CTY(Cross City VOR), and  KPIE(St. Petersburg/Clearwater International airport).KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-1Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4To create a flight plan:1.Select the flight plan (FPL) pages with the right outer knob.  2.Select a flight plan page (preferably other than FPL 0) which does not contain a flight plan (figure 4-1).  If all of the flight  plan pages contain flight plans, refer to section 4.1.6,  ÒDeletingFlight PlansÓ.3.Turn on the cursor ( ).NOTE:The KLN 89(B) flight plan operation is designed so that thefirst waypoint in the flight plan should always be the departure point. Remember to enter the K, P, or Cprefix for certain airports in theUnited States, Alaska (some, but not all cases), or Canada, respec- tively.  See section 2.3, ÒICAO IdentifiersÓ.4.Use the right inner knob to select the first character of the depar- ture waypoint identifier (figure 4-2).  If you have set the default  first waypoint character to Konthe SET 5 page, you will just  need one turn clockwise (see section 3.4.2, ÒData EntryÓ)5.Turn the right outer knob to move the flashing part of the cursor over the second character, then select the desired character.6.Use the above procedure to select the entire identifier for the first waypoint (figure 4-3).7.Press  .  A waypoint page for the identifier just entered will be displayed on the screen      (figure 4-4).  If a mistake was made and  the wrong waypoint identifier was entered, press and beginagain.  If no mistake was made  but the waypoint identifier just  entered isnÕt in the data base, apage allowing creation of a user defined waypoint will appear on the screen.  Refer to section 4.6 for instructions on how to create  a user-defined waypoint.Advanced GPS Operation4-2Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-1APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-2APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  \\' ˆˆ Figure 4-3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-48.Press  again to approve thewaypoint page being displayed.

These waypoints are associated with SID/STAR procedures. ÒFly-overÓ means that, for some reason, the governing agencies have decided that it is important to fly directly over the way- point instead of being able to Òcut the cornerÓ by using turn anticipation (see section 4.2.2). In these cases the KLN 89(B) willpresent a waypoint type identification page (figure 4-6). Simply select the way in which the waypoint is intended to be used with the right outer knob and press . If the SID/STARchoice is selected, the KLN 89(B) will disable turn anticipation for that way-point (if previously enabled). The KLN 89(B) will enable turn anticipation after the waypoint has been passed (if turn anticipation was previously enabled). If En Routeis selected, then normal turnanticipation occurs.9.Use the same procedure to enter the rest of the waypoints in the flight plan (figure 4-7).  If the flight  plan consists of three or more waypoints, the waypoints will automatically scroll as necessary to allow entry of the next waypoint.10.When all of the waypoints have been entered in the flight plan, the right outer knob may be rotated to move the cursor up and down and manually ÒscrollÓ through the waypoints making up this flight plan.  This is useful if the flight plan contains four or more  waypoints since not all of the waypoints can be displayed at one time.  When the right outer knob is rotated counterclockwise, the  cursor may be positioned over Use?.  If there are more than three waypoints in the flight plan, the first two waypoints will then be displayed followed by the last waypoint in the flight plan.  Rotate the right outer knob to move the cursor and manually  scroll to see the missing intermediate waypoints.11.Turn off the cursor ( ).  Additional flight plans may now be created in the same manner.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-3Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  aFigure 4-5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-6APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    \\')3˛Figure 4-74.1.2. VIEWING DISTANCE AND DESIRED TRACK BETWEEN  STORED FLIGHT PLAN WAYPOINTSThe stored flight plan (FPL 1-25) pages have a field to the right ofeach waypoint in the flight plan.  This field may be used to display the  cumulative distance (Dis) to each waypoint or the magnetic desiredtrack (Dtk) from the previous waypoint.If you have more than three waypoints in the stored flight plan, youmay wish to view flight data for waypoints which are not displayed on the screen.  If this is the case, turn on the cursor ( ) and use theright outer knob to scroll down the flight plan until the waypoint of interest is on the screen.This display will default to the distance presentation at power-on.The area in the upper right hand area of the screen is a cyclic field.To cycle between distance and desired track display on a num- bered flight plan page:1.Turn on the cursor ( ); it will come up over the cyclic field, which in this case is displaying distance (Dis) in nautical miles orkilometers (figure 4-8).2.Press  .

OPERATING FROM THE ACTIVE FLIGHT PLAN 4.2.1.GENERAL PROCEDURES Everything you have learned in this PilotÕs Guide thus far isapplicable to using the KLN 89(B) for flight plan operation.  The  following rules and considerations apply for flight plan operation while the KLN 89(B) is in the Leg mode:¥Always verify that you are viewing the active flight plan page(FPL 0) and not one of the other numbered flight plan pages.¥The active leg of the flight plan is designated with a symbol. A leg is defined as the course line between a pair of waypoint (a ÒfromÓ waypoint and a  ÒtoÓ waypoint).  The head of the arrow is positioned to the left of and points to the active ÒtoÓ waypoint.  In figure 4-28, SLC (Salt Lake City VOR) is the ÒtoÓ waypoint.  The tail of the symbol is positioned to the left of the  ÒfromÓ way- point.  KPVU (Provo Municipal) is the  ÒfromÓ waypoint in figure 4-28.  The symbol is not dis-  played unless the KLN 89(B) is actually receiving GPS signals suitable for navigation.(Note:Ifthe unit is in the take-home mode, it has been ÒtrickedÓ into thinking it is receiving signals and there- fore the symbol can be displayed).Also, the symbol will not be displayed if Direct To navigation is occurring and the Direct To waypoint is not in FPL 0.  If in doubt as to whether or not  Direct To operation is occurring,  view the NAV 1 page.  If the top  line shows the symbol (figure  4-29) instead of a  ÒfromÓ waypoint (figure 4-30), then Direct To navi-  gation is occurring.

To view inter- mediate waypoints, turn the cursor on and use the right outer knob to manually scroll through all of the waypoints, as desired.If scrolling is performed all the way to the end of the flight plan, a blank waypoint position will exist so that a waypoint may be added to the end of the flight plan  (figure 4-32).4.2.2.TURN ANTICIPATION AND WAYPOINT ALERTING Prior to reaching a waypoint in the active flightplan, the KLN 89(B) will provide navigation along a curved path segment to ensure a smooth transi- tion between two adjacent legs in the flight plan. That is, the CDI or HSI left/right deviation will be referenced to the dashed line in figure 4-33.  This  feature is called turn anticipation.  The transition  course is based upon the aircraftÕs actual ground-speed and the amount of course angle change between the two legs.  The KLN 89(B) automati-  cally sequences to the next leg after passing the midpoint  in the transition segment.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-9Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-31APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-32WPT 1WPT 2WPT 3Figure 4-33Approximately 20 seconds prior to thebeginning of turn anticipation, the  arrow preceding the active waypoint identifier will begin flashing on the FPL 0 page and on any Navigation page or waypoint page displaying the active waypoint identifier (figures 4-34 and 4-35). This is called ÒwaypointalertingÓ.  If an external waypoint alert annunciator is mounted in the aircraft, this annunciator will begin flashing at the same time.To utilize the turn anticipation feature, start the turn transition to thenext leg in the flight plan at the very beginning of turn anticipation. This occurs when the external waypoint alert annunciator stops flashing and goes on steady.  At this time, the KLN 89(B) will notify  you with a message on the Message page of the new desired track to select on your HSI or CDI.*Adj Nav Crs to 123¡A message will not be given if the change in desired track (coursechange) is less than 5¡.The desired track (DTK) displayed on the NAV 1 page and optionallyon the NAV 4 page also changes to the value for the next leg at the begin- ning of turn anticipation. Turn  anticipation becomes inactive when transition to the next leg has been made.If desired, turn anticipation may bedisabled (or enabled) on the Setup  (SET) 4 page by pressing the button and then rotating the right inner knob to change back and forth between ENABLED(figure 4-36) and DISABLED(figure 4-37).  If turn anticipation is disabled, navigation is provided all the way to the way- point, and waypoint alerting occurs approximately 36 seconds prior to actually reaching the waypoint.Advanced GPS Operation4-10Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-34APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-35APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-36APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-374.2.3.VIEWING THE WAYPOINT PAGES FOR THE ACTIVE  FLIGHT PLAN WAYPOINTSThe waypoint pages for each of thewaypoints in the active flight plan may be easily displayed by selecting the Active (ACT) Waypoint page type. When the ACT page type is first selected, the waypoint page for the active waypoint will be displayed (fig- ure 4-38).  The location of the  waypoint in the flight plan (waypoint  1, waypoint 2, etc.) is annunciated with a number to the left of the identifier.  In addition, an arrow to the left of the waypoint number designates the active waypoint.  If there  is a letter to the far right of the identifier, it designates the type of way-point: I= intersection, U=user-defined waypoint. If the waypoint is an airport, the airport elevation is  displayed here. If the waypoint is a VOR or an NDB, the navaid  frequency is displayed in this area (figure 4-39).To view the waypoints in the flightplan that are not the active way- point:1.Pull the right inner knob to the ÒoutÓ position and turn it to view each of the rest of the waypoints in the order they are contained in the flight plan (figure 4-40).2.Once the desired waypoint is found, the right inner knob may be pushed back to the ÒinÓ position and rotated to display any of the other waypoint pages for that waypoint (figure 4-41).3.Pulling the knob back out will allow further scanning of the waypoints in the active flight plan.4.2.4.COMBINING DIRECT TO AND FLIGHT PLAN  OPERATIONIt is very common when using flight plan operation to use the DirectTo function to proceed directly to a waypoint which exists in the active flight plan.  For example, after takeoff on an IFR flight plan, it is KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-11Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-38APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-39APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-40APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-41common to receive vectors in the terminal area and then be given aclearance direct to the first point in the flight plan that was filed.  The  KLN 89(B), as an advisory navigation source,  makes this kind of  operation very easy to accomplish.  Whenever you do a Direct To  operation to a waypoint which is in the active flight plan (FPL 0), the system will provide navigation to the waypoint and then automatically resume navigation along the flight plan when the Direct To waypoint is reached.  Waypoints which exist prior to the Direct To waypoint in  the active flight plan are bypassed.  Of course, the active flight plan  will never be resumed if the Direct To operation is to a waypoint which is not in the active flight plan.Any of the several methods previouslydescribed for initiating Direct To oper- ation may be used, although the one below is the easiest for this applica- tion.To fly direct to a waypoint in theactive flight plan (FPL 0):1.Select the FPL 0 page.  2.Turn on the cursor ( ) and usethe left outer knob to position the cursor over the desired waypoint  (figure 4-42).3.Press  .  The display will change to the Direct To Page (figure 4-43), with the identifier of  the selected waypoint.4.Press  to approve the DirectTo.  The NAV 1 page will be  displayed (figure 4-44) reflecting the new active waypoint.5.If you now turn back to the FPL 0 page, you will see that the active waypoint is now preceded by an arrow only, instead of the symbol (figure 4-45).  This is  because there is no ÒfromÓ waypoint in the flight plan.If it is desired to cancel the Direct To operation prior to reaching theDirect To waypoint in order to proceed along the flight plan leg, press , then press , then .q q&&Advanced GPS Operation4-12Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 4-42APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-43APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-44APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-454.2.5.VIEWING DISTANCE, ETE, ETA, OR DESIRED TRACK  TO FLIGHT PLAN WAYPOINTSThe active flight plan (FPL 0) page has a data field to the right ofeach waypoint in the flight plan.  This field may be used to display the  cumulative distance (Dis) from the present position to each waypoint, the estimated time en route (ETE), the estimated time of arrival(ETA), for which the time zone abbreviation is displayed, or the mag- netic desired track (Dtk) between each waypoint.If you have more than four waypoints in FPL 0, you may wish to viewflight data for waypoints which are not displayed on the screen.  If this is the case, turn on the cursor () and use the right outer knob toscroll down the flight plan until the waypoint of interest is on the screen.This display will default to the dis-tance (Dis) presentation at power-on(figure 4-45).  The area in the upper  right hand corner of the screen is a cyclic field, which means that . . .To cycle between distance, ETE,ETA, and desired track on the FPL  0 page:1.Turn on the cursor ( ); it willcome up over the cyclic field, which in this case is displaying distance (Dis) in nautical miles orkilometers (figure 4-46).2.Press  .

Altitude alerting allows you to  select a target altitude and it then provides you with an aural alarm 1000 feet prior to reaching the selected altitude, another aural alarm  upon reaching the selected altitude, and another aural alarm if you deviate from the selected altitude.NOTE:The altitude alerting function of the KLN 89(B) does not meet FAR Part 91 for turbojet-powered civil airplanes.NOTE:Before you use the altitude alerting function, it is a good idea tomake sure that the KLN 89(B) baro setting is current. To do this, press  the button and use the right inner knob to modify the baro setting.To Use Altitude Alerting:1. Select the Setup (SET) 9 page and turn on the cursor (). It willcome on over the  Alert:field.  If OFFis displayed, turn the rightinner knob to select ON(figure4-52).2. Select a warn altitude deviation by positioning the cursor over the Warn: field.  Use the right inner knob to select the desired value (figure 4-53).  It is selectable in one hundred foot increments from  200 feet up to 900 feet or in ten m increments from 60 meters to270 meters.  Normally, you will  use the same value all the time so you only have to enter this the first  time you use altitude alerting.  The  recommended warn altitude devia- tion is 300 feet or 100 meters.Advanced GPS Operation4-14Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-51APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  a Figure 4-52APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   &Figure 4-53KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-15Advanced GPS OperationChapter 43. If necessary, adjust the altitude alert audio volume by moving the cursor to the  Volume:field.  Use the left inner knob to select a desired volume between 00 and 99.  The larger the number, the  louder the volume (figure 4-54).4. Press . The Altitude 1 (ALT 1) page will be displayed with thecursor over the altimeter baro set field.NOTE: The altimeter baro set units may be changed between inch-es, millibars and hectopascals on the SET 8 page (see section 3.3).5. Use the right inner knob to update the altimeter baro setting if required (figure 4-55).6. Press the  button again tomove on to the ALT 2 page (fig- ure 4-56).  Only line 2 of the ALT  2 page is used for altitude alert- ing.  The remainder of the ALT 2  page is used only for vertical nav- igation, or VNAV (see section  4.4).  The first altitude displayed on line 2 is the current indicated altitude (9000 feet in figure 4- 56).  With the proper altimeter baro setting, the indicated altitude  should be the same as the aircraftÕs actual altimeter.NOTE: There may be some difference (less than 100 feet) betweenthe indicated altitude and the aircraftÕs actual altitude if the altitude input to the KLN 89(B) is from an altitude encoder because these encoders only provide altitude in 100 foot increments.7. The cursor should be positioned on the selected (or to) altitude field (figure 4-56).  Enter the  selected altitude using the right inner knob (figure 4-57).8. Press to return to the page which was previously displayed.Notice that when you are on an ordinary (non-altitude) page, the first press of the button brings up the ALT 1 page, the sec-ond press of brings up the ALT 2 page, and the third presstakes you back to the original page.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH \"!;!%L  Figure 4-55APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    ˛&Figure 4-54APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˛## Figure 4-56APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ˛%˛ Figure 4-579. The aural alarm activates as follows: ¥1000 feet prior to reaching the selected altitude--three shorttones¥Upon reaching the selected altitude--two short tones¥Deviating above or below the selected altitude by more thanthe warn altitude--four short tonesNOTE:Due to the resolution of the altitude input, it may be neces-sary to descend slightly below or climb slightly above the selected altitude before the two tones are activated indicating that the selected altitude has been reached.  This selected altitude alert must be  activated to arm the system for providing the altitude deviation alert.The KLN 89(B) can provide the aural alarm tones in either of twoways: it may be connected to an audio input of an audio amplifier contained in an audio panel so that the aural alarm is heard through  the aircraftÕs speaker and headphones. Or the KLN 89(B) may be interfaced with an external tone generator installed in the aircraft.In order to use altitude alerting, the KLN 89(B) must have an altitudeinput. If the altitude input is from an altitude encoder or from an air  data computer not having a baro altitude output, then it will be neces- sary for you to manually input the proper altimeter setting in order to get accurate alerting. Remember, the altitude coming from an encoder is pressure altitude and must be corrected with the proper altimeter setting to convert to actual altitude. This altimeter setting is easily accomplished by entering the altimeter baro setting on the Altitude (ALT) 1 page.  Press  twice more to return to the page previously displayed. ItÕs so easy you have no excuses for not keep-ing the baro setting updated!CAUTION:  The altitude alerting feature will only be accurate if the altimeter baro correction is kept updated.  If altitude alerting  is used, it is a good idea to update the altimeter baro set on the ALT 1 page each time you make a change to the aircraftÕs  altimeter setting.NOTE:The altitude alerting feature can be disabled in the KLN 89(B)at the time of installation so that these features are not selectable by the pilot.  When this has been done, the SET 9 page displays  Feature Disabled.Advanced GPS Operation4-16Advanced GPS OperationChapter 44.4.ADVISORY VNAV OPERATION The KLN 89(B)Õs advisory vertical navigation (VNAV) feature allowsyou to program a descent or ascent path, and then provides you with an advisory altitude to fly that will provide guidance along the vertical path.  For example, you can program the VNAV to provide descent  guidance so that you arrive at your active waypoint or a waypoint in the active flight plan at an altitude that you specify.  The KLN 89(B)  will alert you of when to start the descent, and display the advisory altitudes to fly throughout the descent.4.4.1.VNAV FOR DIRECT TO OPERATION  The Altitude 2 (ALT 2) page is used to program the KLN 89(B) for vertical navigation.  To get to the ALT 2 page from any non-altitude  page, press the button twice.  The following example will be usedto illustrate how to use the VNAV feature.  You are using the KLN  89(B) to fly direct to your destination airport, Dubuque Municipal air- port (KDBQ) located in Dubuque, Iowa.  You are presently about 65  nautical miles west of Dubuque, flying at 7500 feet MSL (figure 4-58).  You  desire to use the VNAV to provide  vertical guidance to DubuqueÕs trafficpattern altitude of 1900 feet MSLTo use VNAV on a Direct To: 1. Select the ALT 2 page by pressing the button twice(figure 4-59).  The aircraft Õs actu-al altitude (7500 feet) is displayed on the left side of line 2.  If the  displayed altitude is incorrect it is probably because you have not recently updated the KLN 89(B)Õs altimeter baro setting on theALT 1 page (see section 3.3).NOTE:There may be some difference (less than 100 feet) betweenthe indicated altitude and the aircraftÕs actual altitude if the altitude input to the KLN 89(B) is from an altitude encoder because these  encoders only provide altitude in 100 foot increments.The identifier for the active waypoint (KDBQ) is automatically dis-played on the ALT 2 page.  Prior to programming a VNAV operation,  the top of the page displays that the VNAV is inactive (Vnv Inactive).KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-17Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-58APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ˛˛˛ Figure 4-59Advanced GPS Operation4-18Advanced GPS OperationChapter 42. The cursor should be on and over the selected altitude field on the right side of line 2.  If the cursor is not on, press .3. Enter the desired altitude of 1900 feet in the selected altitude field, using the right inner knob. The altitude may be entered in 100 foot or 10 meter increments (fig- ure 4-60).NOTE:If the KLN 89(B) does not have an altitude input, the indicat-ed altitude field on the left side of line 2 will be preceded by a colon (:), indicating that you should manually enter the aircraftÕs pre- sent altitude, as well as the desired altitude.4. Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the offset field adja- cent to the active waypoint identifier. Entering an offset allows you to reach the desired altitude a specified distance before or after reaching the way-point. If you wished to reach a certain altitude 5 miles after passing a waypoint, you would enter +05. In this example youdesire to reach traffic pattern altitude two nautical miles prior to the airport, which allows sufficient time to slow down and prepare for the landing. Enter an offset of-02nm (figure 4-61).5. Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the groundspeed  (GS:) field.  Use the right inner knob to select your anticipated groundspeed for the descent (figure 4-62), remembering that it may increase from your current groundspeed when you start descending.Notice that the bottom right corner of the ALT 2 page now displays a verti- cal speed.  If you wish to start your  descent now using the displayed ver- tical speed, use the outer knob to  position the cursor over the vertical speed field (figure 4-63).  VNAV oper-  ation is initiated by bringing the cursor over the vertical speed field. Or, by leaving the cursor off of this field, you may watch the required vertical speed increase as you fly toward your waypoint.

Figure 4-60desired vertical speed is reached, position the cursor over the verticalspeed field and VNAV will commence.  When VNAV begins, the top  of the page displays an advisory altitude.  Descending at the vertical  speed displayed on line 4 should keep you very close to the VNAV advisory altitude, but you may need to make slight adjustments to stay right on pace.A better way yet to initiate VNAV is to program a desired vertical speed to use for the descent, after you have entered the desired alti- tude, waypoint, offset, and groundspeed. To program a vertical  speed, do the following step:6. Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the vertical speed field, and then enter the desired value (figure 4-64). Vertical speed may be selected in incre- ments of 100 feet per minute or10 meters per minute. If the time to begin your descent is greater than one hour, Vnv Armedwill now be displayed on the top lineof the page. If the time is less than one hour, the top line displays a countdown to the time to begin the descent.7. Return to any desired page for now by pressing the  buttononce. Alternatively, you may turn off the and use the outerknob to change pages. Approximately 90 seconds before the time to begin descent, the message prompt will flash.  When you  view the Message page, it will display  Vnv Alert.  This is notification for you to view the ALT 2 or NAV 1 page (see section 4.4.3) because it is getting close to the time to begin yourdescent.8. When the countdown timer reaches 0:00, the time will be  replaced with an advisory altitude (figure 4-65).  Begin your descent  at a rate such that the altitude  displayed on your altimeter matches the advisory altitude.NOTE:During your descent, check your actual groundspeed to veri-fy that it is similar to the one you entered on the ALT 2 page.  If it is  different, you should enter your actual groundspeed so that the VNAV function will work properly.If you make any changes to the ÒfromÓ or  ÒtoÓ altitudes, the VNAV waypoint, or the waypoint offset once VNAV has been armed, or is actually in progress, the VNAV status will change to  ÒInactiveÓ.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-19Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   ˝˛<Figure 4-64APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˛$! Figure 4-65Additionally, you may force the VNAV into ÒInactiveÓ status by chang- ing the vertical speed to +0000fpm. To reactivate VNAV afterchanging a parameter, simply move the cursor to the vertical speed field, or select the new desired vertical speed.If you make a change to the groundspeed during the time VNAV isactive, VNAV will remain active, and a new vertical speed will be cal- culated and displayed. If you wish to change this vertical speed, go ahead and do so and the VNAV descent or ascent will be modified for the new parameters.CAUTION:  Advisory VNAV operation will only be accurate if the altimeter baro correction is kept updated.  If advisory VNAV is  used, it is a good idea to update the altimeter baro set on the ALT page each time you make a change to the aircraftÕs altime-  ter setting.4.4.2.VNAV FOR FLIGHT PLAN OPERATION  Using the vertical navigation function when flying via a flight plan isvirtually the same as for the previous Direct To example.  The ALT 2  page will initially contain the identifier for the active ÒtoÓ waypoint in the flight plan.  You may program the vertical ascent or descent refer-  encing this waypoint or you may use the right inner knob to cycle through the waypoints in the active flight plan (FPL 0) which are still in front of the aircraftÕs position.  When another valid waypoint in the flight plan is entered on the ALT 2 page, the aircraft Õs lateral flight path is not altered.  This means that you may program a vertical flight  path having an ascent or descent point that begins prior to the flight plan leg containing the selected VNAV waypoint.4.4.3.VNAV FROM THE NAV 1 PAGE  The NAV 1 page can be configured to display the VNAV status.  This means that you will not have to change pages as much to see what altitude you should be at. You will still need to set up the VNAV problem by using the ALT 2 page as described in section 4.4.1.To use the NAV 1 page to view the VNAV status: 1. Set up the VNAV situation on the ALT 2 page.  2. Select the NAV 1 page.  3. Turn on the cursor and use the right outer knob to move the cur- sor to the cyclic field on the bottom line (figure 4-66).Advanced GPS Operation4-20Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-66KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-21Advanced GPS OperationChapter 44. This field displays bearing to active waypoint, radial from  active waypoint, or VNAV status. Press the button until theVNAV status is displayed (figure 4-67).  Turn off the cursor.The NAV 1 page will now display VNAV status until you change thepage configuration to display something else.  If the VNAV problem  has not been defined yet, then Vnv Offwill be displayed.  If the time to start VNAV operation is greater than one hour then Vnv Armedisdisplayed.  When the time to VNAV operation is less than one hour  then the NAV 1 page will display the time until VNAV operation will start.  For example,  Vnv  4:53 would be displayed if the time untilVNAV operation is 4 minutes and 53 seconds.  If the VNAV function  has started and is suggesting an altitude then the NAV 1 page will display this altitude.  For example  Vnv  4300 would be displayed ifthe suggested altitude was 4300 feet.4.5.CALCULATOR PAGES The Calculator (CAL) pages are used for trip planning and calculation of a variety of flight-related information. They are convenient both on the ground before you begin your flight, and in the air.Data entered on any of the Calculator pages has no effect on naviga-tion data provided on any Navigation (NAV) or Flight Plan (FPL)  pages.  You may perform trip calculations without disturbing ongoing  navigation.NOTE:The Calculator pages rely on pilot enterable inputs forgroundspeed, fuel flow, fuel reserve requirements, altitudes,  temperature, airspeed, etc.  These pages do not utilize inputs from  fuel flow or air data sensors.4.5.1.THE CALCULATOR 1 (CAL 1) PAGE The CAL 1 page allows you to do distance, bearing, time, and mini-mum enroute safe altitude (ESA) calculations that you might otherwise need a chart, ruler, and pocket calculator for.  The KLN  89(B) will perform these calculations either from waypoint to waypoint  (for in-flight calculations, your present position can be one of the way- points), or for one of your flight plans (active or stored).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-67Advanced GPS Operation4-22Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4To calculate distance, bearing, time , and ESA from waypoint to waypoint:1.From the CAL 1 page (figure      4- 68), turn on the cursor ().

To use these pages, you need to have a good idea what the typical fuel flow rate for your aircraft is. This information can often be found for given cruise power settings in a \"performance\" section of the PilotÕs OperatingHandbook for the aircraft. The units for fuel are not specified on this  page, but the units of time are always hours.  This means that you can  use gallons per hour, pounds per hour, kilograms per hour, etc. Like with the CAL 1 page, the fuel calculations can be done from waypoint to waypoint (including present position), or for one of your flight plans.To calculate fuel requirements from waypoint to waypoint:1.From the CAL 2 page, turn on the cursor ( ).

If you desire to change it,  enter the current pressure alti-  tude to the nearest hundred feet or ten meters by using the right inner knob (figure 4-87).3.Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the first  Temp:field, and then use the right inner and outer knobs to enter theoutside air temperature (degrees Celsius) (figure 4-88). The first digit of the temperature is either Ò0Ó if the temperature is above zero or Ò-Ó if the temperature is below zero. For maximum accuracy, the static air tempera- ture should be entered. This is the temperature of air without the effect of heating due to the aircraftÕs movement through the air.For the airspeeds of most piston aircraft, the difference between static air temperature and the observed air temperature (or  Òtotalair temperatureÓ) is negligible.

If the pressure altitude was previously calculated on the  CAL 4 page, or entered on the CAL 5 page, it will already be  displayed.4.Move the cursor to the first  Tempposition, and then enter theoutside air temperature (degrees C) by using the right inner and outer knobs (figure 4-90).  The  first digit of the temperature is  either Ò0Ó if the temperature is above zero or Ò-Ó if the tempera- ture is below zero.  For maximum  accuracy, the total air tempera-  ture should be entered.  This is  the temperature of air including the effect of heating due to the aircraftÕs movement through the air.  The temperature read on a standard outside air temperature gauge found on most piston air- craft is Òtotal air temperatureÓ.  Since the difference between static air temperature and the observed air temperature (or Òtotalair temperatureÓ) is usually negligible, any temperature enteredon the CAL 5 page is transferred to this page.  The true airspeed  (TAS) is now displayed.NOTE: If a compatible air data system is interfaced to the KLN89(B), true airspeed (TAS) is displayed directly on the Other 11 (OTH 11)page for the present conditions.4.5.7.THE CALCULATOR 7 (CAL 7) PAGE The CAL 7 page is used to determine the present wind direction andspeed.

The sunrise and sunset  times for the selected waypoint, date, and time zone are now dis- played (figure 4-96).4.6.CREATING USER-DEFINED WAYPOINTS You may create and store up to 500 user-defined waypoints.  These waypoints will be very helpful to you.  One major application is private  use airstrips, which are not included in the Jeppesen data base. They are also handy for points which you fly over frequently, and  wish to navigate to.  For example, a crop sprayer would want to store  the locations of the fields he or she dusts often.There are three ways to create a user-defined waypoint.  If you happen to know the latitude and longitude of the point, that is one option.  The waypoint can also be defined as a radial and distance  from another waypoint.  A third choice is just to store your present  position under the identifier you have chosen.NOTE:Whenever you are in a waypoint entry situation, such as aDirect To waypoint or flight plan, and you enter an identifier which is not in the data base, the KLN 89(B) will automatically start the user- defined waypoint creation process.Advanced GPS Operation4-30Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 4-96APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-94APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-95To delete a user-defined waypoint that is no longer needed, seesection 3.14.2, \"Viewing and Deleting User Waypoints and Waypoint Remarks\".4.6.1.

This is nice for  \"remembering\" a spot you are at.  Let\\'s suppose you\\'re at a private  strip that you want to name \"VALLY\"To create a user-defined waypoint at your present position: 1.Select the NAV 2 page (present position) and press the  button. A page like the one in figure 4-97 will be displayed with your latitude and longitude at the time you pressed the button. The user-defined waypoint is initially given the name USR##, where ## is the first available number between 01 and 99.2.If you wish to use this waypoint name, press  and thewaypoint creation is complete  (figure 4-98).  If you want to  choose your own name for it, turn the right inner knob to select the first character of the identifier (figure 4-99). Remember that when the cursor is on, the right inner knob changes the character and the right outer knob moves the cursor around.3.Spell out the rest of the identifier using the right inner and outer knobs (figure 4-100).4.Press  .

This is done by selecting between the two course modes, LEG and OBS. The LEG mode means that the course to the active waypoint is selected by the KLN 89(B), and is the default mode when the KLN 89(B) starts up. The other course mode, OBS, is the mode that allows you to select the course to or from the active  waypoint. In this mode, the KLN 89(B) operates very much like a VOR receiver. This is the mode that you will use quite often if you conduct any non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B.àThe KLN 89B also has three modesthat are associated with approach operations. These are Enroute,  Approach Arm and Approach Active. These modes will be explained in Chapter 5.The course mode is annunciated onthe left side of the screen, line 3. When in the Leg mode, it displays Leg(figure 4-119), and when in theOBS mode, it displays the selected magnetic course (figure 4-120).4.7.1.SELECTING THE LEG MODE OR THE OBS MODE  To change course modes:1.Press the  button.2.If the KLN 89(B) was previously in the Leg mode, it will now be in the OBS mode, and vice versa.4.7.2.THE LEG MODE  The following are the characteristics of the Leg Mode:1.The default course deviation indicator (CDI) sensitivity is plus and minus five nautical miles, full scale.  This applies to the CDI on  the NAV1 page as well as any external CDIs or HSIs interfaced  to the KLN 89(B).  If the CDI or HSI has five dots left and right of  the center position, then each dot represents one nautical mile of deviation.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-35Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-120APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-1192.Navigation is provided along the great circle path between two waypoints.  As you probably know, great circle navigation is the  shortest distance between two points located on the earth\\'s surface.  In the case of Direct To operation, the \"from\" waypoint  is not displayed but it is the point where Direct To operation was initiated.  The course to fly while in this mode is referred to as the  desired track (Dtk).  The desired track is displayed on the NAV 1 and may be selected for display on the NAV 4 page. To fly a great circle course between two points, the desired track may be constantly changing. A good way to illustrate this concept is with a world globe and a piece of string. You can determine the great circle path between Denver, Colorado and Manila, Philippines by stretching the string over the globe between these two points. Notice that you would start the flight with a northwesterly desired track, which gradually becomes due westerly, and finally south- westerly by the time you reach Manila. Of course, your trips with the KLN 89(B) will be substantially shorter and the desired track will probably change only a few degrees.3.Automatic waypoint sequencing is provided during flight plan operation.  As you reach a waypoint in your flight plan, the next  leg of the flight plan automatically becomes active. àThere aresome situations during approach operations in which automatic leg sequencing is automatically disabled. See Chapter 5.4.Turn anticipation may be utilized in flight plan operation as described in section 4.2.2.5.The Minimum Enroute Safe Altitude (ESA) displayed on the ALT 1 page is the highest MSA sector altitude from the present position to the destination waypoint along the active flight plan or Direct To route (whichever is in use). See section 3.12.4.7.3.THE OBS MODE  The following are characteristics of the OBS mode.1.The course deviation indicator (CDI) sensitivity is plus and minus five nautical miles, full scale.  This applies to the CDI on the NAV  1 page as well as any external CDIs or HSIs interfaced to the KLN 89(B). If the CDI or HSI has five dots left and right of the  center position, then each dot represents one nautical mile of deviation.2.The course is defined by the active waypoint and the selected magnetic course. A course \"to\" or \"from\" the active waypoint may be selected.Advanced GPS Operation4-36Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-37Advanced GPS OperationChapter 43.The course selection is normally made by changing the selected course displayed on an external indicator such as an HSI or CDI. When this is done, the pilot must verify that the proper course has been selected by confirming the digital selected course readout displayed on the KLN 89(B).  In the OBS mode the selected  course is always displayed as part of the mode annunciation on line 3 of the left side of the KLN 89(B) screen. In many installa- tions, two or more navigation sources can be displayed on one indicator. In these situations there is a switch in the aircraft panel which will determine what navigation source is displayed. For the KLN 89(B) to properly read the external indicator the KLN 89(B) must be the displayed navigation source on the external indicator.When the KLN 89(B) is not the displayed navigation source onthe external indicator, it is possible to change the selected course from the KLN 89(B) screen using the procedure below.To change the selected course in OBS mode:1.If the KLN 89(B) is not in OBS mode, select OBS mode by  pressing the button. Ifalready in OBS mode, turn on the cursor( ). The cursorwill automatically be turned on over the OBS selected course field (figure 4-121).2.Turn the right inner knob until the correct selected course isdisplayed (figure 4-122).3.Turn off the cursor ( ).NOTE: The above procedures apply to ORS 02 software. For ORS01 software, the cursor does not automatically come on when the OBSmode is selected and must be activated by using the  but-ton. In addition, the OBSselected course field is not the default  cursor location. The right outer knob must be used to position the cur- sor over this field after it has been turned on.4.There is no automatic leg sequencing or turn anticipation. 5.The Minimum Enroute Safe Altitude ( ESA) displayed on the ALT1 page is the highest MSA sector altitude between the present position and the active waypoint. See section 3.12. Other way- points in the active flight plan do not affect the ESA.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  &˛!Figure 4-122APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   &%#Figure 4-121Advanced GPS Operation4-38Advanced GPS OperationChapter 46.When the active waypoint is a VOR, and the AUTO magnetic variation mode is active (see section 4.10), the published mag- netic variation for the VOR is utilized rather than the calculated magnetic variation, so that the KLN 89(B) indication will be identi- cal to a NAV receiver indication.4.7.4. SWITCHING FROM THE LEG MODE TO THE OBS MODE The following mode transition occurs if the KLN 89(B) is in the Legmode and the mode is changed to the OBS mode.:1.The waypoint that was active in Leg mode prior to the mode change remains the active waypoint in OBS mode.2.The selected course is defined by two different methods depend- ing on the installation and the status of the unit.i.If the KLN 89(B) is the displayed navigation source when the change is made to OBS mode, then the selected course  becomes whatever was set on the external indicator prior to changing to the OBS mode.  This value should normally be the  desired track to the active waypoint if you had the external indica- tor set to the correct value prior to switching to the OBS mode.ii.If the KLN 89(B) is not displayed on the external indicator, then the selected course is chosen such that the deviation from the selected course remains the same.3.If the OBS value chosen by default from rule 2 above is unac- ceptable, you can always define the desired course by the methods described in section 4.7.3.4.7.5.EFFECTS OF SWITCHING FROM OBS MODE TO LEG  MODEThe following mode transition occurs if the KLN 89(B) is in the OBSmode with a TO indication and the mode is switched to the Leg  mode:1.The waypoint that was active while in the OBS mode remains the active waypoint when the Leg mode is activated.  The system  does not attempt to orient itself on a leg of the active flight plan unless the TO/FROM indicator is indicating FROM. In the FROM case, the KLN 89(B) will reorient on the active flight plan.2.The selected course ( Obs) that was active in the OBS modeprior to switching to Leg mode becomes the desired track (Dtk) inKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-39Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4the Leg mode, unless the mode change was made on the ÒfromÓside in which case the KLN 89(B) will calculate the correct desired track for the new leg.3.With the exception of #2 above, the characteristics of normal Direct To operation apply.4.If the active waypoint was part of the active flight plan (FPL 0), the system will revert to normal flight plan operation once the active waypoint is reached.4.7.6.GOING DIRECT TO A WAYPOINT WHILE IN THE OBS  MODEThe direct-to function will select the OBS value that will take the air-craft from the present position direct to the active waypoint when the  KLN 89(B) is not the displayed navigation source on the external indi- cator.If the KLN 89(B) is the displayed navigation source on an HSI or CDIit is not possible for the KLN 89(B) to change the OBS value.  In these situ-  ations the KLN 89(B) will provide a scratchpad message that will tell you what OBS value should be selected to go direct to the active waypoint (figure 4-123).4.7.7.ACTIVATING A WAYPOINT WHILE IN THE OBS MODE  While in the OBS mode, you may activate another waypoint by usingthe normal Direct To method or by using a second method.  This sec- ond method activates another waypoint without changing the selected course (OBS).  In other words, when the new waypoint is activated, the D-Bar is not necessarily recentered.  In figure 4-124 the KLN  89(B) is in the OBS mode and the selected course is 149¡.  You have just crossed ARG and desire to  activate the next waypoint in the flight plan, GQE, without recentering the D- Bar.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ,$%!Figure 4-124APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-123Advanced GPS Operation4-40Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4To activate a waypoint in OBS mode without changing the selected course:1.Press  (figure 4-125).

The selected course does not change, therefore this  method does not center the D-Bar like a Direct To operation does.4.7.8.CHANGING THE CDI SCALE FACTOR  The CDI scale factor can be changed by using the NAV 1 page.  In nor- mal operations it is possible to select a CDI scale factor which is plus or minus 5 NM, 1 NM or 0.3 NM full scale deflection.  This means that if  the scale factor was ±1 NM and the needle was deflected full scale to  the right, the aircraft would be 1 NM left of course.  The default CDI  scale factor is ±5 NM. To change the CDI scale factor: 1.Select the NAV 1 page. 2.Turn on the cursor ( ).  It will appear over the second line of the NAV 1 page, which usually dis- plays the course deviation indicator (figure 4-128).  This is a cyclic field,  as indicated by the carat (>) pre-ceding it.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH , Figure 4-127APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,aFigure 4-126APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  a Figure 4-128APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,aFigure 4-125KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-41Advanced GPS OperationChapter 43.Press the  button until thisline changes to the CDI scale field (figure 4-129).4.Rotate the right inner knob to select the desired CDI scale factor  (figure 4-130).

When the KLN 89B selects a CDI scale  factor it is not possible to select a scale factor that is less sensitive than what the KLN 89B has automatically chosen.  For example, as  you will see in the next chapter, the approach-arm mode usually has a scale factor of ±1 NM.  While in the approach-arm mode it is not  possible for you to select the ±5 NM scale factor.  This is to ensure  proper operation of the approach modes.4.8.THE FUEL MANAGEMENT PAGES Certain models of fuel management computers manufactured by Shadin Company, ARNAV Systems, Inc., and Sheltech Ltd. May be interfaced with the KLN 89(B).  The primary benefit of having the KLN  89(B) interfaced with a Òreal timeÓ fuel management computer is that the system can continuously compute the amount of fuel required to reach the destination and the amount of fuel that will be on board  upon reaching the destination.  The concept is the following.  The fuel  management computer continuously sends the rate of fuel flow and the amount of fuel remaining to the KLN 89(B).  The KLN 89(B) con-  tinuously calculates the aircraftÕs distance, groundspeed, andestimated time enroute (ETE) to the destination waypoint.  The fuel  required to reach the destination waypoint is the ETE multiplied by the current rate of fuel flow.  The amount of fuel that will be remaining  at the destination is the amount of fuel presently remaining minus the fuel required to reach the destination.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 4-129APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-130Advanced GPS Operation4-42Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4CAUTION:  The KLN 89(B) fuel calculations are based on the pre- sent rate of fuel flow, the present groundspeed, the present distance to destination along the programmed route, and the  amount of fuel presently remaining.  Before take-off, the fuel flow  computer must be properly initialized with the amount of fuel on  board (FOB) the aircraft.  For some Shadin fuel computers without  display units, you may enter the initial FOB during the KLN 89(B) Turn-on and Self Test (see section 3.2).  Since many factors influ-  ence the required amount of fuel to reach the destination, it is the pilotÕs responsibility to view the fuel management pages often to check for any significant changes.  Some factors affecting the  amount of fuel required are power changes, altitude changes, head- wind/tailwind component changes, fuel/air mixture adjustments, and routing changes.The OTH 7, OTH 8, OTH 9, and OTH 10 pages are used to display fuelmanagement information for KLN 89(B)s interfaced with compatible fuel management computers. If there is no fuel management computer inter- face, these fuel management pages are not displayed.4.8.1.THE OTHER 7 (OTH 7) PAGE  The OTH 7 pages display the followinginformation (figures 4-131 and 4-132):¥The destination waypoint (thefinal waypoint in FPL 0 or a direct to waypoint if the waypoint is not  included in FPL 0).

When interfaced with one  of these systems, the KLN 89(B) will display real time air data parame- ters such as true airspeed (TAS), static air temperature (SAT), total air temperature (TAT), Mach number, density altitude, and pressure altitude. With a TAS input from an air data computer and a compatible heading input, the KLN 89(B) will calculate and display real time wind data (mag- nitude and direction).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-135APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-136APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-137APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-138Advanced GPS Operation4-45Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4NOTE:Heading information inputs to the KLN 89(B) must be in a formatwhich is different than available from most mechanical compass sys-  tems, including the Bendix/King KCS 55A (KI 525A HSI with bootstrap  heading synchro) and KCS 305 compass systems.

MAGNETIC VARIATIONThe KLN 89(B)\\'s primary coverage area is from N 74¡to S 60¡as wasshown in figure 3-1. Magnetic variation is automatically computed within  this coverage area when Mag Var is in the default AUTO mode on the SET 2 page.  Navigation outside this area is automatically referenced to  true North unless a manual input of magnetic variation is made on the SET 2 page. The following message will be displayed on the Message  page:*Magnetic Var InvalidNav Data Referenced To True NorthA user-defined magnetic variation may be entered on line 4 of the SET 2page.

As with any good friend, you may need some time to get well- acquainted. This will allow you to utilize it to the maximum extent. A great  way to get to know the KLN 89(B) is to use it outside the airplane, using  what we call the \"take-home mode\".There are products available which allow you to use the KLN 89(B) at your home, office, or hotel to have get-acquainted time in the take-home mode, for instance the Commander 2000 from Lone Star Aviation.  It is  also helpful to do flight planning and perform data base updates outside the airplane, perhaps with a home personal computer.For more information on the Commander 2000, or to place an order, con-tact:Lone Star Aviation Corp. 1306 Tatum Drive Arlington, TX 76012 Phone: (817) 548-7768 FAX: (817) 261-8692When the KLN 89(B) is in the take-home mode, it performs as if it isreceiving adequate satellite signals to determine its position.  It displays  the latitude and longitude of its last known position or of whatever posi- tion it is initialized to on the Setup 1 (SET 1) page (see section 3.6, \"Initialization and Time to First Fix\").  In addition, a ground speed and  heading may be entered on the SET 1 page and the KLN 89(B) will track  a flight plan or a direct to waypoint just as if it was actually functioning in  an aircraft.  Distances count down, waypoints sequence, and the devia-  tion bar follows the progress of the simulated flight.  Using the take-home  mode is an excellent way to learn the operation of the KLN 89(B) without worrying about the engine running, other traffic, or even terrain. Fortunately, these phenomena are not simulated in the take-home mode!KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-1Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 55.  APPROACHES AND SID/STARS (KLN 89B  ONLY) This is the last chapter on the operation of the KLN 89(B).  In this chapter you will learn how to use the KLN 89B for non-precision  approach and SID/STAR procedures.  Note that only KLN 89Bs  which are configured for IFR approaches are capable of performing the procedures discussed in this chapter.  KLN 89Bs which are con-  figured for en route and terminal operations only will give you access to SID/STAR procedures but not non-precision procedures. All of these procedures require that you are comfortable with the operation of the unit as presented up to this point.  In particular, you need to be  comfortable with flight plan operation (sections 4.1 and 4.2) and the OBS mode (section 4.7).5.1.  NON-PRECISION APPROACH OPERATIONS Flying non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B are not in them- selves very difficult.  However, it is different than using traditional  equipment such as VORs and NDBs.  With this in mind, make sure  that you practice with the KLN 89B in VFR weather with a check pilot before attempting to use the KLN 89B in actual IFR conditions.CAUTION:  The KLN 89B obtains approach information from the data base. Therefore, it is extremely important that the data base  is current. The KLN 89B is approved for IFR non-precision approaches only when the data base is current.  If you attempt  to select an approach when the data base is out of date, you will  be given the status-line message: ÒD Base ExpireÓ in the bottom  left portion of the screen as a reminder.The following sections assume that your KLN 89B is properlyinstalled in the aircraft with all of the necessary accessories to fly non-precision approaches.  In most cases this will mean that the air-  craft has external switch/annunciators to arm the approach mode.  An external annunciator to indicate when a message is active and when waypoint sequencing is about to occur will also be installed.  In some  installations the aircraft will have a NAV/GPS switch to select which navigation source is displayed on the primary HSI or CDI.The NAV 4 page has been specifically designed to provide most ofthe functions needed for non-precision approaches.  This page pro-  vides an interface that presents pertinent navigation information, a way to access the flight plan, and a graphic presentation of the pre- sent position relative to the flight plan waypoints.  You will find this  page to be a good friend while performing GPS based non-precision approaches.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-2Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5NOTE: There are some approach procedures in the world that arenot suited for the operational characteristics of the KLN 89B.  These  procedures are not included in the data base.  Therefore it is not  possible to use the KLN 89B for these approaches.  It is good pre-  flight practice ensure that the KLN 89B contains anticipated  procedures for the flight.In addition to the two course modes (Leg and OBS) described in sec-tion 4.7, there are also two approach modes.  These are approach  arm and approach active.  The status of the approach mode is indi-  cated on an external switch/annunciator. In most installations the external annunciator will indicate ARMfor the approach arm modeand approach active will be annunciated by ACTV.  The main differ- ence of these modes from the normal en route mode is that the integrity monitoring is set to a tighter level. Another difference between these modes and the en route mode is that the CDI scale factor will usually change to ±1.0 NM for ARM and will always change  to ±0.3 NM when in the APR ACTV mode. The ARM mode can be selected in two ways.  The normal way is that this mode will be selected automatically by the KLN 89B when the aircraft is within 30 NM of an airport and an approach is loaded in the  flight plan for that airport.  It is possible to arm the approach mode at  a distance greater than 30 NM from the airport by pressing the exter-  nal GPS approach switch, but the KLN 89B will not change the CDI scale factor until the aircraft reaches the 30 NM point.  If the GPS  APR external switch is pressed while the approach mode is armed, then the KLN 89B will disarm the approach and change back to en route mode.  The CDI scale factor will also change back to ±5.0 NM.  The approach can be re-armed by simply pressing the GPS APR switch again.  The APR ACTV mode can only be engaged automatically by the KLN89B. To cancel the APR ACTV mode press the external GPS APR switch.  This will change the mode to APR ARM.  Once past the FAF, it is not possible to return to the approach active mode without con-ducting a missed approach and flying back to the FAF.General Procedure for Non-Precision Approaches Non-precision approaches will all have the general flow of events asfollows.  Refer to figure 5-1.1.Select and load the approach into the flight plan.This can bedone at almost any time but must be completed before reaching the Final Approach Fix and should be done as soon as possible.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-3Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5This corresponds to point A in figure 5-1.  If the aircraft is greater than 30 NM from the airport, then the CDI scale factor will remain  at the default ±5 NM full scale deflection. 2.Transition to the approach arm mode. This will occur auto-matically when the aircraft is within 30 NM of the airport and there is an approach loaded into the flight plan (position B in fig- ure 5-1).  The CDI scale factor will change to ±1.0 NM over the  next 30 seconds and the external annunciator will indicate ARM.3.Get established on the final approach course.¥  NoPT arrival route¥  Radar vectors  (requires OBS mode)¥  Procedure turn or holding pattern (requires OBS mode)¥  DME arc17351432MAPFAF IAFARPApproach Arm CDI Scale Factor  1.0 nmCDI Scale Factor  5.0 nmCDI Scale Factor constant at 0.3 nmCDI Scale Factor changing from 1.0 nm to  0.3 nm7030 nm2 nmTransition to approach ACTV if: - LEG mode is selected  - Integrity checks OK  - Aircraft heading towards the FAF -FAF or co-located IAF/FAF is active  waypoint Load approach  into flight planApproach automatically arms when within 30 nm of the airport and an  approach is loaded into  the active flight planFAF-Final Approach Fix  MAP-Missed Approach Point  ARP-Airport Reference Point  IAF-Initial Approach Fix  MAHP-Missed Approach Holding Point NOTTOSCALENOTFORNAVIGATION(A)(B)(C)(D)(E)MAHP(F)Automatic Waypoint sequencing stopsFigure 5-14.Transition to the approach active mode. This mode change isautomatic and occurs at position C in  figure 5-1 when:¥the aircraft is 2 NM from the FAF and the approach mode is armed¥  the LEG mode is selected¥  the aircraft is heading towards the FAF¥  the FAF or a co-located IAF/FAF is the active waypoint¥the KLN 89B confirms that adequate integrity monitoring is available to complete the approach.¥  RAIM is available at FAF & MAPIf any of these conditions are not met, the KLN 89B will not transitionto the approach active mode and a missed approach will be required if the conditions do not change before reaching the FAF.  If all of  these conditions are met then the CDI scale factor will start to change to ±0.3 NM and the external annunciator will indicate  ACTV.5.At the FAF (position D in figure 5-1) the CDI scale factor will be at ±0.3 NM and will remain at this scale factor until you manually  cancel the approach mode by either pressing the external GPS APR button to change to the ARMmode, by initiating a direct tooperation or by changing to OBS mode.WARNING:  It is not approved to conduct the final portion of the approach unless the KLN 89B is in the approach active mode (ACTV on external annunciator).6.Fly to the Missed Approach Point. (position E in figure 5-1).  The KLN 89B will notautomatically sequence to the next waypoint.You must manually change to the appropriate waypoint accord- ing to the situation.  By default, the KLN 89B will nominate the  first waypoint of the published missed approach procedure when is pressed, and the active waypoint is the MAP, and you have flown past the MAP (rule number 4 in section 3.9).7.If necessary conduct the missed approach procedure. Remember to always refer to the paper chart when conducting a missed approach.  The OBS mode is usually needed at some  point during a missed approach and is always required to fly the holding pattern (position F in figure 5-1).The details of the above operations as well as several examples ofhow to conduct non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B are given in the following sections.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-4Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 55.1.1.  SELECTING AN APPROACHThe first item in the list from the previous section is to select and load the approach into the active flight plan.  Approaches are selected  from the APT 8 (or ACT 8) page of the airport for which you desire to  shoot the approach.  If you are operating from a flight plan, the easi-  est way to get to the approach information is by turning to the ACT page for your destination as described in section 4.2.3.The following example will use the VOR or GPS RWY 25R approachto Los Angeles International airport (KLAX).To select and load an approachinto the active flight plan (FPL 0):1.Turn to one of the APT pages and select KLAX by using the  cursor, inner, and outer knobs (figure 5-2)2.Use the right inner knob to turn to the APT 8 page.  If you select- ed KLAX from the APT 1 page turn the inner knob one click counter-clockwise to reach the APT 8 page.3.Turn the cursor on by pressing  .  The cursor comes up on the first approach in the list of approaches.  Use the right outer knob  to move the cursor to different approaches (figure 5-3).  If there are more than 3 approaches to an airport you can move the cur- sor down to ÒscrollÓ the other procedures into view by rotating the right outer knob.4.With the flashing cursor over VOR 25Rpress .  5.The KLN 89B will present a list of Initial Approach Fixes (IAFs) corresponding to this approach. In this example we want the  ELMOO IAF.  Select this by  pressing when the cursor isover ELMOO(figure 5-4).  Note: If there is only one IAF for a procedure, then the KLN 89B willskip this step and go on to the next step.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-5Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-2APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 5-3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 5-4Approaches and SID/STARs 5-6Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5In many cases ATC will not tell you explicitly which IAF to use. Inthese cases you need to select an IAF which is closest to the route of flight that you expect. If you expect radar vectors, then the selection of the correct IAF is less important because you will be given vectors to the FAF and will not need to use the IAF.6.The KLN 89B next presents a list of waypoints that make up the approach. Review these waypoints to make sure that you have selected the correct IAF.  If  there are more than four waypoints in the approach you can move the cursor up to ÒscrollÓthe other waypoints into view by rotating the right outer knob (figure 5-5).  7.Move the cursor over  ADD TOFPL 0?(figure 5-6) and press.8.The KLN 89B will then bring up the FPL 0 page and put the  sequence of approach waypoints in front of the airport reference point (figure 5-7).NOTE:At any time during the process of selecting an approach youcan easily return to the previous step by pressing the button.The waypoints that make up the approach procedure are loaded intothe flight plan.  At the top of the list of approach waypoints is a  Òhead-erÓ that describes the approach that follows. An example of this is shown on line 1 of figure 5-7, which indicates that the VOR 25R approach for Los Angeles International Airport is in the active flight  plan (FPL 0).After the approach has been entered into the flight plan the KLN 89Bchecks to make sure that the resulting flight plan Òmakes senseÓ.  If the KLN 89B detects any waypoints that are in both the en route por- tion of the flight plan and the portion that makes up the approach,  then the following message will be given:*Redundant Wpts in FPLEdit En Route Wpts As NecessaryAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-7APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  $ Figure 5-5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-6KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-7Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Examine the flight plan and delete those en route waypoints that arenot necessary.NOTE:Approaches can only be entered into FPL 0, the active flightplan. If the KLN 89B is turned off for more than 5 minutes, then the  approach is deleted when power is turned back on.5.1.2.  INTERPRETING WHAT YOU SEEIn the example above, you may have noticed a couple of waypointswith somewhat strange names.  The second waypoint of the  approach procedure, LAX18, has a name that is not normal for a waypoint.  This is an example of what are called  ÒterminalÓ waypoints. These are waypoints that are associated with a specific airport.  They  are used to define a spot on the ground that does not have a normal waypoint name.  In the case of  ÒLAX18Ó this point is 18 NM from the LAX VOR on the 68¡radial.  The fifth waypoint in the approach pro- cedure, MA25B, is another type of terminal waypoint.  In this case  this point is the missed approach point for runway 25.  This approach  applies to both the left and right runways so the letter B is used to mean ÒbothÓ.There are few other types of terminal waypoints that you will need tobe familiar with to fully understand GPS non-precision approaches.  The naming convention for these waypoints are as follows:Fxyyy¥  F stands for Final Approach FixIxyyy¥  I stands for Intermediate FixCxyyy¥  C stands for Course FixMxyyy¥  M stands for Missed Approach PointRWzzz¥  RW stands for Runway Fix.  This is usually the MAP for the approach¥  zzz will be a runway number possibly  including L for Left, R for Right, C for Center, or B for Both.Daaab¥  D stands for DME arc waypoint¥  aaa is the radial that the fix is on from the reference VOR¥  b will be a letter corresponding to the distance from the reference VOR.  For example, G is the seventh letter of the alphabet so D234G would be  a point on the 234¡radial 7 NM from the reference VOR. DME arcs greater than 26 NM will have waypoints where the first two characters are the  first two letters of the DME identifier. The next  three characters will be the radial that the arc way point is on.In the rules above x and yyy are defined as follows.  For runways withonly one approach, x will be replaced with an ÒAÓ or a  ÒFÓ.  For run- ways that have multiple approaches, x will be replaced with ÒVÓ for VOR, ÒNÓ for NDB, or  ÒRÓ for RNAV.  The letters yyy will be replaced with either the runway identifier (e.g., FF25L) or, for circling approaches, the inbound course to the missed approach point (e.g., MA259).Waypoints along a given radial will be named such that the first threeletters are the reference VOR/DME and the next two are the DME  distance. If the distance is greater than 100 NM the order is reversed.  For example, LAX18 is 18 NM from LAX while 26FLW is 126 NM from FLW.If the aircraft is not too far from the destination airport, the NAV 4page can be used to determine where some of these waypoints are relative to others in the approach.  At the time of this writing, all of the  NOS charts and some Jeppesen charts do not show the special ter- minal waypoints that are required for GPS approaches. For this reason it is a good idea to understand what the special waypoints are used for and what they mean.You may have also noticed that some waypoints have a small letterat the end of the waypoint name. The small letter is an aid that we have added to the name of some waypoints to help you recognize important points in the approach. These suffixes are displayed on many of the KLN 89B  pages.  The definitions of these suffixes are:i - The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) of the approach. f - The Final Approach Fix (FAF) of the approach m - The Missed Approach Point (MAP) of the approach h - The Missed Approach Holding Point (MAHP) for the approachEvery approach will have a FAF and a MAP.  Almost all will have an IAF and missed approach holding point.  Another item that you should notice inthe flight plan is the line that has *NOWPT SEQon it (figure 5-8).  This is what is referred to as a fence and the purpose of this line is to tell you thatApproaches and SID/STARs 5-8Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-8KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-9Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5the KLN 89B will not automatically sequence past the waypoint thatprecedes the fence.  The waypoint before the fence is always the  missed approach point. The reason that waypoint sequencing is not allowed is that many missed approach procedures require specific actions before going to the missed approach holding point (e.g., climbing on a fixed heading until reaching an altitude).5.1.3.  CHANGING OR DELETING AN APPROACH ONCELOADED INTO THE FLIGHT PLANThe sequence of waypoints that are retrieved from the data base of the KLN 89B define the approach procedures as they are charted. To ensure that the proper path over the ground is followed, it is not possible to either delete or add waypoints to the approach section of the flight plan.  To help you see which waypoints are en route  waypoints and which are approach waypoints, the KLN 89B does not display a colon next to the waypoint number on the FPL 0 page if the waypoint is an approach waypoint.  It is only possible to replace the existing approach with another one,or delete the entire approach from the flight plan.To replace an existing approach, or delete an approach: 1.With the left page displaying the active flight plan (FPL 0) turn the cursor on by pressing (figure 5-9).  2.Move the cursor so that it covers the approach header at the top ofthe approach procedure.  Once the cursor comes over the  approach header, it will automatically change to read CHANGEAPPR?(figure 5-10). If you pressin this condition the KLN 89Bwill bring up the APT 8 page that corresponds to the current  approach.  At this point it is possi-  ble to select different approach procedures, different IAFs, or both.3.If you press the  button whilethe cursor is over the approach header it will change to read DELETE APPR?(figure 5-12).  If you press now, the KLN 89BAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-9APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-10APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-11Approaches and SID/STARs 5-10Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5will remove the entire approach procedure from the active flight plan.  If the KLN 89B was in the approach arm or the approach  active mode, then deleting the approach will cause the KLN 89B to change back to en route mode.  This means that the CDI scale  factor will change back to the default ±5.0 NM scale. 5.1.4.  EXAMPLE APPROACH:  NO PROCEDURE TURN Now that you know the basics of inserting an approach into the flightplan, we can now show the approach operation of the unit by several examples.  This first example will use the approach that was loaded  into the flight plan in section 5.1.1.  This example will show how the  KLN 89B sequences through an approach and what type of annunci- ations and scale factor changes can be expected.  The KLN 89B will  remain in the familiar Leg mode so there will be no need to change between Leg and OBS mode in this example.  Refer to the approach  plate for this approach (figure 5-12) to see what the procedure looks like.For this example it is assumed that you are on an active flight planwith the final destination being the Los Angeles International airport, KLAX.  It is also assumed that ATC will not give you radar vectors  during this approach.1.Load the VOR 25R approach to KLAX as demonstrated in sec- tion 5.1.1.2.When you are within 30 NM of the airport, the KLN 89B will auto- matically arm the approach mode and provide the following  message:*Press ALT To Set BaroThe message acts as a reminder to make sure the KLN 89B is usingthe correct barometric pressure. If the barometric information is not correct, then the integrity monitoring provided by the KLN 89B will not be as good as it could be. Press to bring up the ALT 1 page andverify that the barometric pressure is correct.NOTE: If the KLN 89B is interfaced with a compatible air data com-puter that provides the correct barometric pressure to the KLN 89B,  then the previous message is not displayed and it is not necessary to update the barometric pressure.At this time the KLN 89B will smoothly change the CDI scale factor to±1.0 NM.  The external approach annunciator installed in the aircraft  will indicate that the approach is in the ARM mode.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-11Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 53.As you approach ELMOO, the KLN 89B will provide waypoint alerting on the external annunciator as well as on the screen of the KLN 89B.  Once you pass ELMOO, the KLN 89B will auto-  matically sequence to the next waypoint in the approach, LAX18.Figure 5-12Approaches and SID/STARs 5-12Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 54.This may be a good time to select the NAV 4 page. This page is especially useful for getting a feeling of where you are in the approach (figure 5-13).5.As the aircraft approaches the LAX18 waypoint, the KLN 89B will again provide waypoint alerting.  As the aircraft passes LAX18  and sequences to FITON, the KLN 89B will provide a message telling you to set the external indicator (CDI or HSI) to a new value. If desired track (DTK) is shown on the screen, this value will flash when the external selected course does not match the DTK within 10¡.6.As the aircraft approaches the FAF (FREBY) it is a good idea to check over the status of the KLN 89B. Look at the KLN 89B screen to verify that LEG sequencing is selected.  Remember,  the KLN 89B will not transition to the approach active mode if the OBS mode is selected. If the KLN 89B shares an HSI or CDI with other NAV sources, it is also good to verify that the NAV/GPS switch is set to GPS.7.By the time the aircraft is 2 NM from FREBY (figure 5-14), the Final Approach Fix, the KLN 89B will make a prediction to see if integrity will be available at the FAF and at the MAP.  If the pre-  diction indicates that integrity monitoring will be available, and RAIM is currently available, the KLN 89B will change the GPS APR annunciator to read ACTV. At this time the KLN 89B will also start to change the CDI scale factor.  By the time the aircraft reaches the FAF (FREBY) the CDI scale factor will be down to ±0.3 NM. 8.The fix NOELE is not included in the list of waypoints provided in the data base. You will need to identify this point by using the along track distances given in the profile view of the approach plate.  In this example NOELE is located 1.3 NM from the MAP.  When the distance to MA25B is 1.3 NM, then the aircraft is at NOELE and you can descend to the MDA for this approach.NOTE:Some approach procedures require that you add up severalalong-track distances to be able to identify a step down fix.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-14APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-13KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-13Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 59.The KLN 89B will again provide waypoint alerting as you approach MA25B. This is shown on the NAV 4 page by a flashing active waypoint identifier (figure 5-15).The following steps would need to be performed if a missed approach is required.11.Upon reaching MA25B and not seeing the runway you decide to perform a missed approach. Remember, the KLN 89B will not automatically sequence past the missed approach point. This is shown on the NAV 4 page by not showing any lines connecting waypoints that are past the MAP. To perform the published  missed approach procedure, press to bring up the direct-to page.  The default waypoint will be the first waypoint of the  missed approach procedure. In this case the first waypoint is LAX. Confirm this waypoint as the direct to waypoint and press .12.Upon reaching LAX, the KLN 89B will sequence to the next way- point in the missed approach procedure, INISH.  In this example,  there is no holding pattern published for the missed approach so you can expect further instructions upon reaching INISH.NOTE:If ATC gives you instructions for a missed approach that isdifferent from the published missed approach procedure, it is always possible for you to select a different direct to waypoint than the default direct to waypoint.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   \\'Figure 5-155.1.5.  EXAMPLE APPROACH:  OFF-AIRPORT NAVAIDAn approach that is quite common is an approach that is based off ofan off-airport navaid. An example of this is the VOR RWY 22 approach to Clovis New Mexico Municipal airport, KCVN. To fly this procedure as published use the following steps and refer to figure 5- 16 for the procedure. For this example assume that the aircraft isApproaches and SID/STARs 5-14Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Figure 5-16approaching from the Northeast going Direct-to the Clovis airport with no active flight plan.1.Load the approach into the flight plan as described in section 5.1.1.  In this case there is only one IAF so the KLN 89B does not present the option for you to select an IAF.  In this example, there is no active flight plan to begin with so the KLN 89B will ask to add the approach to FPL 0.2.Approaching the area ATC tells you to go direct-to the TXO VOR and clears you for the approach to KCVN.  This is easy to do  from the NAV 4 page by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning through the active flight plan by turning the inner knob. Once TXO is displayed in the scanning window (figure 5-17), press and then to initiatea direct to operation to the TXO VOR.3.At a distance of 4 NM to the TXO VOR, the KLN 89B will give the following message:*If Required Select OBSThis message provides a reminder that to fly a course reversal theOBS mode needs to be selected.  Note from the approach chart that  there is a NoPT Arrival Sector for this approach.  If you are approach-  ing TXO within the indicated area there is no need to perform a course reversal and you need to ignore this message. The NoPT sector is not stored in the data base so it is not possible for the KLN 89B to know if a course reversal is required or not; as a result, the KLN 89B will always give this message whenever a waypoint could be used for a course reversal.  The KLN 89B will properly sequence  to the FAF to MAP leg and transition to the approach mode when 2 NM from the IAF/FAF.If, however, you are approaching from any other direction a course reversal is required and the OBS mode will need to be selected.  If  the OBS mode is not selected before reaching TXO, then the KLN 89B will automatically sequence to the missed approach point.  This  is not desirable when performing a course reversal so the OBS mode must be selected before reaching TXO.NOTE: The KLN 89B will only remind you to select OBS mode if theIAF is the active waypoint. Therefore if a course reversal is required, make sure the IAF is the selected waypoint.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-15Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-17Approaches and SID/STARs 5-16Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 54.If a course reversal is required, then upon reaching TXO perform the appropriate holding pattern entry and set the inbound course on the external CDI or HSI.  In this example the inbound course  is 241¡.  At this point the KLN 89B works very similar to a con- ventional VOR/DME.5.Once established on the inbound course of 241 ¡, switch back tothe Leg mode. When Leg mode is selected the FAF is automati- cally made the active waypoint when the IAF and the FAF are at the same waypoint.NOTE:It is mandatory that the unit be in LEG mode with the FAF asthe active waypoint before crossing the FAF to activate the approach active mode and change to ±0.3 NM scale factor. The CDI scale fac-  tor changes from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3 NM over the two miles to the FAF.  Delaying the switch from OBS to Leg mode compresses the scale factor change. This will make the transition more abrupt.  If the switch  from OBS to Leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the KLN 89B to change to the approach active mode.6.When the aircraft is 2 NM from the FAF, the KLN 89B will verify that the proper integrity is available.  If integrity monitoring is  available for the approach, then the KLN 89B will change to the Approach Active mode.  This will be annunciated on the external  approach status annunciator as well as on the KLN 89B.  The  CDI scale factor will also start to change from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3  NM.7.Upon reaching TXO, the KLN 89B will automatically sequence to RW22, the missed approach point.8.The fix at 8 DME from TXO along the final approach course is not included in the waypoints that come from the data base. Since the distance that the KLN 89B is giving you is distance TOthe MAP, you will need to mentally figure out when the aircrafthas reached this point.This is done by looking at the along trackdistances given in the plan view of the approach.  In this case the  fix is 4.1 NM from RW22.  Upon reaching this distance you can  descend to the MDA for this approach.If a missed approach is required for this approach, then the followingsteps would be required.9.The published missed approach procedure for this approach is to make a climbing left turn to 5700 feet and proceed direct to the TXO VOR.  In this case TXO will be the default direct to waypoint KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-17Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5when is pressed.  This is the desired waypoint so press  to confirm the waypoint and proceed direct to the VOR.NOTE: If ATC gives you instructions for a missed approach that aredifferent from the published missed approach procedure, it is always possible for you to select a different direct to waypoint than the default direct to waypoint.10.As the aircraft approaches TXO you will need to select OBS mode to stop waypoint sequencing and define the inbound course for the holding pattern.  If you do not select the OBS  mode before the aircraft is within 4 NM of the holding point, then the KLN 89B presents a message reminding you to select the OBS mode. NOTE:If another attempt at the approach is desired after holding, itis necessary to manually change the active waypoint. When the FAF and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the KLN 89B will automatically change the active waypoint to the FAF when you change from OBS to LEG. Make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active mode.5.1.6.  EXAMPLE APPROACH:  RADAR VECTORSFor this example we will use the same approach that was used in theprevious section except this approach will be conducted with the help of radar vectors from approach control.  The aircraft will be assumed  to be arriving from the West, although this does not change the way the approach will be flown using the KLN 89B.1.The approach has been selected and entered into the flight plan and the aircraft is going direct to KCVN (Clovis, New Mexico Municipal)  as described in section 5.1.5.2.As soon as ATC mentions radar vectors you should immediately start to think of the OBS mode.  Once given radar vectors,  change the active waypoint to TXO and select the OBS mode.  Note that it is not important what order these events take place. It is just as effective to change to OBS mode and then change the active waypoint as it is to change the active waypoint and then switch to OBS mode.3.Next, change the selected course on the CDI or HSI to the final approach course.  For this exam-  ple, the inbound course is 241 ¡.It is now possible to watch your progress on the NAV 4 page and anticipate when you will be given new headings to fly (figure 5-18).4.Once established on the inbound course, you will need to change back to the Leg mode to allow for proper approach operation and automatic leg sequencing.  For best performance, the change  back to Leg mode should be made before the aircraft is 2 NM from the FAF.NOTE: It is mandatory that the unit be in LEG mode with the FAF asthe active waypoint before crossing the FAF to activate the approach active mode and change to ±0.3 NM scale factor.  The CDI scale fac-  tor changes from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3 NM over the two miles to the FAF.  Delaying the switch from OBS to Leg mode compresses the scale factor change. This will make the transition more abrupt.  If the switch  from OBS to Leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the KLN 89B to change to the approach active mode.5.The rest of this approach would be flown using the same steps as presented in section 5.1.5.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-18Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-18KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-19Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 55.1.7.  EXAMPLE APPROACH: ON-AIRPORT NAVAIDAnother common type of approach is an approach that is based onan on-airport navaid. These could be either VOR or NDB approach- es. An example of this type of approach is the VOR RWY 24  approach to Bowman airport in Louisville, Kentucky (Figure 5-19).  The airport identifier for this airport is KLOU.Figure 5-19Approaches and SID/STARs 5-20Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5For this example assume that the aircraft is approaching KLOU fromthe Nabb VOR.1.After passing the Nabb VOR, you are told to expect the VOR 24 approach at KLOU.  You load the approach using the procedure  described in section 5.1.1.2.When the distance from the present position to the destination airport reaches 30 NM, the KLN 89B will automatically arm the  approach mode. The CDI scale factor will transition to ±1.0 NM  and the KLN 89B will provide more sensitive integrity monitoring. You also press to update the barometric information.3.When the aircraft is 4 NM from the BQM VOR, the KLN 89B will give a message reminding you to select the OBS mode.  The  OBS mode is required for the procedure turn.  After passing  BQM, select the outbound course of 068¡on the external CDI or HSI.  4.The aircraft is now headed outbound for the procedure turn.  As soon a practical, you will need to change the active waypoint to FF24, the final approach fix.  This is done by pulling out on the  right inner knob and scanning until FF24f is displayed in the win- dow (figure 5-20) then pressing , then pressing . The OBScourse will still be what is select- ed on the external CDI or HSI (68¡).5.With the OBS mode selected and FF24 as the active waypoint, it is possible to fly the procedure turn.  Allow enough distance past  FF24 to complete the procedure turn and still be 2 NM away before reaching the FAF.  After completing the outbound portion  of the procedure turn, change the selected course to the inbound course of 248¡on the external CDI or HSI.6.Once established on the inbound course the Leg mode will again need to be selected so that proper approach operation and way- point sequencing will occur.NOTE:It is mandatory that the unit be in LEG mode with the FAF asthe active waypoint before crossing the FAF to activate the approach active mode and change to ±0.3 NM scale factor.  The CDI scale fac-  tor changes from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3 NM over the two miles to the FAF.  Delaying the switch from OBS to Leg mode compresses the scaleAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   --\"%6Figure 5-20KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-21Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5factor change. This makes the transition more abrupt.  If the switch from OBS to Leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the KLN 89B to change to the approach active mode.7.When the aircraft is 2 NM from the FAF, the KLN 89B will verify that the proper GPS integrity is available.  If integrity monitoring is available for the approach, then the KLN 89B will change to the Approach Active mode.  This will be annunciated on the external  approach status annunciator as well as on the KLN 89B.  The  CDI scale factor will also start to change from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3  NM.8.Normal waypoint alerting will occur as the aircraft passes the final approach fix. The leg from the final approach fix to the missed approach point will become active and the CDI scale factor will remain at ±0.3 NM.  If the AUTO scale factor was selected on the  NAV 4 page, then the scale factor will zoom in on the airport as the aircraft gets closer and closer to the missed approach point. Eventually the map scale changes to 1 NM.The following steps are followed if a missed approach is required. 9.The missed approach instructions call for a climbing left turn to a heading of 110¡until intercepting the 061¡inbound course to themissed approach holding fix, SCUMY.  To fly this with the KLN  89B it will be necessary to put the KLN 89B into the OBS mode and make SCUMY the active waypoint. Change the selected course on the external CDI or HSI to 061¡.10.Once the aircraft reaches SCUMY, you will need to perform a holding pattern entry suitable for this holding pattern and set the selected course to 241¡for the holding pattern.5.1.8.  EXAMPLE APPROACH:  DME ARCDME arc procedures with the KLN 89B are completely different fromusing traditional VOR and DME equipment. DonÕt worry thoughbecause DME arc procedures using the KLN 89B are also easier than using traditional equipment. This is because the KLN 89B pro- vides left/right guidance around the arc. No more having to watch  distance in one place and radial in another!When being vectored, a DME arc is really a whole bunch of initialapproach fixes placed one next to each other to form an arc. Very  rarely do you actually fly to the beginning of an arc, especially in a radar environment. Instead, the flight path of the aircraft generally  intersects the arc at some point. Once the aircraft is near the arc, it is then possible to turn so that the arc distance is maintained until time to turn to the inbound fix.The following example will show how DME arc procedures are flownusing the KLN 89B. This example approach will be to use the VOR RWY 12 approach to Owatonna, Minnesota, KOWA. The approach plate for this approach is in figure 5-22. Assume that the aircraft is approaching from the North and is in a radar environment.1.ATC assigns the VOR RWY 12 approach. Turn to the APT 8  page for KOWA to select the approach. You select the VOR 12 approach and the KLN 89B pre- sents the IAF selection page (figure 5-21).2.There are five choices for the IAF. Three of these choices you can recognize but the other two, D040L and D220L, are unfamil- iar and not shown on this chart. These two waypoints are the data base identifiers for the ends of the arc. D040L means DME arc point, 040 is the radial on which the waypoint lies, and L indi- cates the distance of the arc. L is the twelfth letter of the alphabet so the L indicates that this is a 12 DME arc. In a similar manner D220L can also be decoded. In this example the aircraft is approaching from the north so the D040L IAF will be selected.3.The KLN 89B knows that this point is associated with a DME arc. Once an arc waypoint is chosen, the KLN 89B determines what radial of the reference VOR the aircraft is presently located on. A waypoint is created that is located at the intersection of the pre- sent radial and the DME arc. This waypoint is the first waypoint in the list of waypoints presented on the APT 8 page before loadingApproaches and SID/STARs 5-22Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 5-21the approach into the flight plan(figure 5-23). This waypoint is named using the same conven- tion discussed  earlier.NOTE:If the present radial from the reference VOR is outside of the defined arc, then the KLN 89B will default to the beginning of the arc.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-23Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Figure 5-22APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-23CAUTION:  The KLN 89B does not take into account the geome- try of the active flight plan when determining the arc intercept point.  This point is defined solely on the present radial and the  defined arc distance from the reference VOR.  For this reason it  is better to delay selecting approaches that contain DME arcs until the aircraft is closer to the destination.4.With the cursor over  ADD TO FPL 0? , Press .  The approach will be loaded into the active flight plan just like any other  approach would be.5.After the approach is loaded into the flight plan the KLN 89B may give the message:*Redundant Wpts In FPLEdit En Route Wpts As NecessaryThis message is given because very often it will be necessary toedit the active flight plan to ensure that proper waypoint sequenc- ing occurs.  Examine the flight plan and, if practical, observe the  NAV 4 page to make sure that the sequence of waypoints does not have any unnecessary legs in it.6.The KLN 89B will now provide guidance to the arc intercept point. The NAV 4 page displays the entire arc on the screen. The por- tion that is between the beginning of the arc and the arc intercept is drawn with a dashed line. The part that is between the arc inter- cept point and the end of the arc is drawn with the normal solid line (figure 5-24).7.In some cases ATC may provide radar vectors to the arc.  The KLN 89B provides a means to define a new intercept point based on the current track of the aircraft over the ground.  This can be  done from either the NAV 4 page or from the FPL 0 page. The  dashed line displayed on the NAV 4 page will help you to deter- mine if ATC is giving you correct vectors.¥From the NAV 4 page, pull out the right inner knob to bring up the waypoint scanning window. ¥Turn the right inner knob until the first waypoint of the arc is displayed, D011L in this example.  For approaches this will  have a small (i) appended to the waypoint name. If the  recalculation is to be done from the FPL 0 page, then turn on  the cursor and move it over the first waypoint of the arc.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-24Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-24¥From either page press . This will change the waypoint to read MOVE?(figure 5-25).  If it is desired to recompute  the arc intercept point then  press .  If a new arc  intercept point is not desired  then press again.¥If was pressed, then theKLN 89B will calculate an arc intercept point based on the present track of the aircraft over the ground.  NOTE:If the present track does not intercept the arc, then theKLN 89B will display  No Intcptin the scratchpad area of the screen.8.When the aircraft approaches the arc the KLN 89B will provide waypoint alerting and turn anticipation to join the arc.9.Once established on the arc the KLN 89B provides left/right guid- ance relative to the curved arc. Distance to the active waypoint is the distance from the present position to the active waypoint, NOT the distance along the arc. Refer to Appendix A for the geometry of the arc.10.During the arc, the desired track will be constantly changing.  To help you keep the orientation correct the NAV 4 page will auto- matically display DTK on the fourth line.  It is not possible to  change this to something else while on the arc.  The value dis-  played for the desired track will flash when the difference between the CDI or HSI and the current desired track is greater than 10¡.11.Some DME arcs have defined radials that serve as step down fixes. These points are not stored in the data base. To help you determine your position relative to these step-down points along the arc, the KLN 89B will display a new value in the bottom right corner of the display on the NAV 4 page. This new bit of informa- tion is denoted by the letters ARC followed by three numbers.The three numbers represent the current radial that you are on relative to the reference VOR/DME. The arc radial is forced into this position when the aircraft is 30 NM from the arc. The  ARCdisplay is shown in figure 5-24. Just watch this value and when it reads the same as one of the step-down points you can descend as necessary. This particular example does not have such points, but there are quite a few approaches that do.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-25Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-25Approaches and SID/STARs 5-26Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5NOTE:Autopilot performance may not be satisfactory if coupled inthe NAV mode while flying the arc.  Many autopilots were never  designed to fly curved paths.  If autopilot performance is not satisfac-  tory while flying DME arcs, select the HDG mode and keep changing the heading bug to keep the D-bar centered.12.As the aircraft approaches the end of the arc, the KLN 89B will provide waypoint alerting and turn anticipation to the next leg.13.When the aircraft is 2 NM from FOW VOR, the FAF, the KLN 89B will attempt to transition to the approach active mode.  Since  the DME arc procedure is flown entirely in the LEG mode the only possible problem would be if the integrity monitoring did not check out.14.The visual descent point is identified by the along track dis- tance to the MAP to be 1.5 NM. When the aircraft reaches this point (figure 5-26), and the run- way environment is in sight, it is possible to descend for a landing.If a missed approach is needed use the following steps: 15.The missed approach calls for a climb to 2000 and then a left turn direct to FOW.  The KLN 89B will not automatically  sequence past the MAP.16.Once 2000 feet has been reached press  , the missedapproach holding point will be the default direct to waypoint. Press to confirm the direct to waypoint and proceed to the FOW VOR.NOTE:If ATC gives you instructions for a missed approach that isdifferent from the published missed approach procedure, it is always possible for you to select a different direct to waypoint than the default direct to waypoint.17.The OBS mode will need to be selected to accomplish the hold- ing pattern.  If this is not done before the aircraft is 4 NM from  FOW, the KLN 89B will provide a message reminding you to select the OBS mode.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-26NOTE:If another attempt at the approach is desired after holding, itis necessary to manually change the active waypoint. When the FAF and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the KLN 89B will automatically change the active waypoint to the FAF when you change from OBS to LEG. Make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active mode.5.1.9.   APPROACH PROBLEMSVery rarely there will be a problem with the integrity of the GPS sys- tem while you are conducting non-precision approaches with the KLN 89B.  In some cases the KLN 89B will determine that there will not be  sufficient integrity monitoring for the leg between the FAF and the MAP, or RAIM is not currently available. In these cases the KLN 89B will not go into the approach active mode and will present the follow- ing message:*RAIM Not AvailableAPR Mode Inhibited Predict RAIM on OTH 3In these cases you will not be able to finish the approach becausethere is insufficient integrity monitoring. The OTH 3 (Other 3) page provides a means for you to predict when RAIM will be available.  To perform a RAIM prediction on the OTH 3 page two pieces of infor- mation are needed.  The first is the location that the prediction will be  for and the second is the time for the prediction.The destination waypoint will, by default, be the missed approachpoint of an approach loaded in the flight plan. If there is no approach in the flight plan, then the default waypoint is the last waypoint in the active flight plan. Of course it is possible for you to enter any way- point in this field.The time used for the RAIM prediction will be the current ETA to the destination airport or the MAP. This time is automatically updated by the KLN 89B so there is usually no need to enter a value. If you are making a RAIM calculation for planning purposes, it is also possible to enter a time in this field. An important point about this time is that  the time used for RAIM prediction is always in the future and limited  to 24 hours from the present time. For example, if the time is now  19:30 and the time entered for the ETA is 18:30, then the prediction will be made for the next day not one hour ago.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-27Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5To perform a manual RAIM calculation:1.Turn the left outer and inner knobs to select the OTH 3 page.  2.Press  .  The cursor will be over the RAIM @Destfield.3.Enter the desired waypoint identifier by using the inner and outer knobs just like you do for any other waypoint entry.4.Once the desired waypoint identifier is entered (figure 5-27), press .  Press  again ifthe waypoint information is  correct.5.The cursor will now be over the ETA field. Use the inner knob to enter the desired hour.  Note  that the current time zone is displayed next to the ETA field. Use the outer knob to move the cursor over the minutes field. Use the inner and outer knobs to select tens of minutes and single min- utes as required.  When the desired time is selected press  .The RAIM calculations will start.6.The RAIM calculation will usually take a few seconds before an answer is reached.  During this  time the OTH 3 page will be as shown in figure 5-28.7.Once the RAIM calculation is complete, the OTH 3 page will indi- cate the results of the test.An example is shown in figure 5-29 and 5-30. RAIM is available from 15  minutes before ETA until 5 minutes after ETA. However, RAIM is predict-  ed not to be available from then until  15 minutes after the ETA. By showing the times when RAIM will be available it is possible for you to how to alter your ETA to ensure that there will not be any RAIM problems.Even more rare will be the case whenthe KLN 89B cannot provide sufficient integrity monitoring or if there is an actual satellite failure while the air- craft is on the leg from the FAF to the MAP.

This will change the unit to the  approach-arm mode and navigation information will be restored.5.2.  SID/STAR PROCEDURES The KLN 89B allows access to navigation SIDs (Standard Instrument Departures) and STARs (Standard Terminal Arrival Routes) by  SID/STAR name. SID/STAR procedures stored in the data base can only be considered accurate as long as the data base is current. Even though the data base contains SID and STAR procedures, there is a lot of information that is not included in the data base. Therefore, the paper chart is still the primary source of information. For example, many procedures require the aircraft to fly to a certain altitude, along a heading until intercepting a course, and many other procedures that the KLN 89B can not automatically accomplish. Many procedures require pilot action to ensure that the proper path is flown over the ground. The main purpose of loading a SID or a STAR into the active flight plan is to provide you with a quick way of loading a potentially large number of waypoints.SID and STAR procedures can be as challenging to fly as some approaches are. Therefore it is mandatory that you are comfortable with the operation of the KLN 89B before attempting to fly SID and STAR procedures. In particular, flight plan operation and the OBS mode should be second nature to you. NOTE:There are some SID/STAR procedures in the world that arenot suited for the operational characteristics of the KLN 89B.  These  procedures are not included in the data base and therefore the way- points that make up these procedures would have to be entered manually.  It is good preflight practice ensure that the KLN 89B con-  tains anticipated procedures for the flight.SID and STAR procedures are stored with the airport for which theyapply.  SID and STAR procedures are accessed through the APT 7  page.  If there are both SIDs and STARs for a given airport, then  there will be two APT 7 pages, one to select a SID and the other to select a STAR.  This is indicated by APT+7.  It is also possible to  have only a SID or only a STAR in which case there is only one APT 7 page.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-29Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5SID and STAR procedures are defined in three parts.  The parts are the SID or STAR name (e.g., PORTE9), a transition (e.g., Fellows), and a runway specific component (e.g., RW 01L).  The APT 7 pages  lead you through the selection process.5.2.1.  SELECTING A SID Use the following procedure to select a SID.  Some steps may not be necessary depending on the procedure that you wish to fly.  For this  example, the PORTE NINE departure from San Francisco  International (KSFO) will be used.To select a SID: 1.Select KSFO on one of the airport pages (figure 5-31).  If you are  operating from an active flight plan you can use the ACT 7 page for KSFO by scanning through the active flight plan (see section 4.2.3).2.If not already displayed, rotate the right inner knob until the APT 7 page appears as in figure 5-32. Make sure that  ÒSIDÓ is displayed in the upper right corner of the display. This will allow the selec- tion of SID procedures.3.Turn the cursor on by pressing , and rotate the right outerknob until the flashing cursor is over PORTE9(figure 5-33).  With the cursor over PORTE9, press.4.The KLN 89B will now ask which runway that you will be using. For this example select RW01B(figure 5-34) and press . TheÒBÓ stands for  ÒBothÓ so selecting RW01Bmeans it is applicable torunways 1L and 1R.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-30Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-31APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 5-32APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-33APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-345.The last bit of information needed to define this SID is the transition. This example uses the Fellows transition.  To select the Fellows  transition, move the cursor down to FLW(figure 5-35) and press.6.The KLN 89B now presents a list of waypoints that make up the SID.  Review these waypoints if  desired. If the waypoints look cor- rect then press  with thecursor over ADD TO FPL 0? toload the SID into the active flight plan (figure 5-36).7.The KLN 89B will then add the SID procedure after the airport reference point in the active flightplan (figure 5-37).  If the airport reference point is not included in  the active flight plan, then the KLN 89B will ask to add this way- point to the active flight plan.Section 5.2.4 gives the actions required to fly this SID.  5.2.2.   SELECTING A STAR The steps required to select a STAR are very similar to those required to select a SID. The only difference is the order of the steps to define the STAR and where the STAR is loaded into the flight plan. The steps required to define Acton Four arrival with the Wink transi- tion serve as an example of how to select a STAR. This STAR is to the Dallas/Fort Worth International airport (KDFW).To select a STAR: 1.Select KDFW on one of the airport pages (figure 5-38).  If you  are operating from an active flight  plan you can use the ACT 7 page for KDFW by scanning through the active flight plan (see section 4.2.3).2.Turn to the APT 7 page for KDFW.  Make sure that  ÒSTARÓ is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-31Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-36APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-37APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 5-38APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   -1+Figure 5-353.Turn the cursor on by pressing the , and, if necessary, rotatethe right outer knob until the flashing cursor is over the desired STAR.  With the cursor over  AQN4(figure 5-39), press .4.The KLN 89B will now ask which transition you want to use. For this example select INK(figure 5-40) and press .5.In some cases, the STAR proce- dure requires you to select a specific runway. To select a specific runway move the cursor over the desired runway and press .In this example the STAR does  not require a specific runway so the KLN 89B skips this step.6.The KLN 89B now presents a list of waypoints that make up the STAR (figure 5-41).  Review  these waypoints if desired and then press to load the STARinto the active flight plan.7.The KLN 89B will then add the STAR procedure before the air- port reference point in the active flight plan (figure 5-42).  If the  airport reference point is not included in the active flight plan, then the KLN 89B will ask to add this waypoint to the active flight plan.NOTE:It is not possible to load a SID or STAR into a flight plan otherthan FPL 0. Furthermore, SID and STAR procedures are deleted  from FPL0 after the power is off for more than 5 minutes. 5.2.3.  EDITING A SID OR STARFrom the proceeding two examples you may have noticed that SIDand STAR procedures have procedure ÒheadersÓ just as approaches do. It is possible to use these headers to delete and change the entire procedure just like is done with approach procedures. One dif- ference between SID and STAR procedures and approaches is that it is possible to add waypoints to and delete waypoints from the pub-Approaches and SID/STARs 5-32Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH a Figure 5-39APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    aFigure 5-40APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-41APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-42lished procedure. To help you differentiate between approaches (noadding or deleting waypoints allowed) and SID or STAR procedures (adding and deleting waypoints allowed) the waypoint number has a period (.) next to it instead of a blank space. The period also differen-tiates a SID or STAR waypoint from a  ÒregularÓ waypoint that has a colon (:) next to the waypoint number.  To add an individual waypoint in the SID or STAR procedure: 1.Use the right knobs to select the FPL 0 page.  2.Turn the cursor on by pressing the  .  Rotate the right outer knob as necessary to position the cursor over the waypoint iden- tifier which you desire to  follow the waypoint being added.3.Use the right inner and outer knobs in the normal manner to define the desired waypoint.4.Press  to display the waypoint page for this identifier. If thewaypoint is correct, then press a second time to confirm the waypoint page. The new waypoint is added to the waypoints that make up the SID or STAR procedure.To delete an individual waypoint in a SID or STAR procedure: 1.Use the right knobs to select the FPL 0 page.  2.Rotate the right outer knob to place the cursor over the waypoint to be deleted.3.Press  . The letters DEL(delete) will appear to the left of theidentifier and a question mark will appear to the right of the identifier.4.If this is the desired waypoint to delete, then press  .  If it is not the desired waypoint, press .NOTE:Adding waypoints to or deleting waypoints from SID or STARprocedures does not change the way that they are stored in the pub- lished data base.To change or delete an entire SID or STAR procedure from the active flight plan:1.Use the right knobs to select the FPL 0 page.  2.Turn the cursor on by pressing the  .  Move the cursor over the SID or STAR procedure header by using the left outer knob.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-33Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 53.With the cursor over the procedure header, press  to changethe SID or STAR or press and then to delete the entireprocedure.NOTE:Any waypoints manually added to a SID or STAR will bedeleted if the SID or STAR is changed or deleted using the above procedure.5.2.4.  EXAMPLE OF A SID PROCEDURETo illustrate the use of the KLN 89B with a SID, the Porte Nine departure loaded into the flight plan in section 5.2.1 will be used. Remember that ÒRW01BÓ was selected meaning that the procedure is applicable to both runways 1L and 1R. The Fellows (FLW) transition was also selected. This procedure is one of the more difficult that you are likely to come across.  Most procedures are not  this difficult, but this SID serves as a good example for what steps to take when you encounter a difficult procedure.To fly this procedure use the following steps and refer to the chart forthis SID (figure 5-43):1.Load the SID as described in section 5.2.1.  2.The procedure states  ÒIntercept and proceed via SFO R-350,cross the 4 DME fix at or above 1600Õ...Ó. To accomplish this por-tion of the SID, put the KLN 89B into the OBS mode with SFO04 as the active waypoint and make 350¡the selected course. It iseasiest to accomplish these steps before take-off. SFO04 is the waypoint that is 4 DME from the SFO VORTAC and 350 ¡is theinbound course to this fix. After take-off climb to 1600 Õ as required by the SID.3.Once the aircraft reaches SFO04, turn left to a heading of 200 ¡.At this point it is necessary to manually change the active way- point to ÒPORTEÓ. This is done easily from either the NAV 4 pageor from the FPL 0 page. In either case, once PORTE is highlighted by the cursor, press to bring up the direct topage.4.Press  to confirm PORTE as the direct to waypoint.5.Change the selected course on the HSI or CDI to the new value of 135¡. As required by the SID, continue flying a heading of 200¡until the HSI or CDI needle centers and then fly to keep the needle centered and fly to PORTE.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-34Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-35Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Figure 5-436.Before reaching PORTE, change back to the Leg mode to enable automatic waypoint sequencing. Once the aircraft reaches PORTE the KLN 89B will automatically sequence to the next way- point, PESCA.7.After passing PESCA, the procedure calls for a 090 ¡heading untilintercepting the 116¡course to WAGES intersection. To do this with the KLN 89B, change back to the OBS mode and make sure that WAGES is the active waypoint.  Set the selected course to  116¡.8.Before reaching WAGES change to the Leg mode.  This will allow automatic waypoint sequencing upon reaching WAGES.9.There is an altitude restriction marked with an  ÒxÓ on the chart. The name of this point is 26FLW. 26FLW means that the waypoint  is 126 NM from the FLW VOR/DME. Make sure to meet any alti-  tude requirements upon reaching this waypoint.10.Once the aircraft reaches FLW, proceed on with the rest of the flight plan as required.5.2.5.  EXAMPLE OF A STAR PROCEDURE To illustrate the use of the KLN 89B with STAR procedures the stepsrequired to fly Acton Four arrival to Dallas/Fort Worth International will be shown in this section.  This procedure is considerably simpler than  the SID example shown in section 5.2.4.  For this example assume that the aircraft departs from El Paso, Texas and files for the Acton Four arrival with the Wink transition. Use the fol- lowing steps to fly this procedure with the KLN 89B and refer to the chart for this STAR (figure 5-44):1.Load the STAR into the flight plan as described in section 5.2.2.  2.This STAR is very simple and the KLN 89B will automatically guide the aircraft along the proper route until the AQN VOR. 3.Long before reaching AQN examine this procedure and notice that there are two different routes depending on what type of air- craft is flying the STAR. Turbojets fly to CREEK intersection while non-turbojets fly to RENDY intersection. The data base in the KLN 89B has the sequence of waypoints for the turbojet procedure  NOT the sequence for non-turbojets.NOTE:It is extremely rare to have a different path over the ground forturbojets and non-turbojets, but be sure to cross check with your paper charts.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-36Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5If the aircraft you are flying in is a turbojet, then fly the rest of the STAR as depicted on the chart with no changes to the flight plan. If the aircraft is not a turbojet then follow these steps:4.Turn to the FPL 0 page and delete the following waypoints: MARKUM, BRYAR, HULEN, FLATO, and CREEK.  To do this  turn on the cursor and rotate the right outer knob until the cursor is over one of the above waypoints.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-37Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Figure 5-445.Press  and then to delete a waypoint.6.Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all of the unnecessary waypoints are deleted.7.Now add JERRY, CRESN, and RENDY to FPL 0 by using the right inner and outer knobs and as necessary.8.The rest of the STAR can now be flown.

Examine the  active flight plan and remove those waypoints that occur both in the enroute and the approach sections of the flight plan.Timer Expired--  This message appears when the alarm time on the CAL 3 page is reached.User Data Base Lost--  This message appears when the KLN 89(B) determines that the internal memory backup battery is dead or that some other internal failure has occurred which has caused user-entered way- points, flight plans, and waypoint remarks to be lost.User Data Lost--  This message appears when the KLN 89(B) deter- mines that the internal memory backup battery is dead or that some other internal failure has occurred which has caused user data such as page setups to be lost.Using EmergencyBattery-- This message appears when the back-up battery pack (ifinstalled) is supplying unit power.Vnv Alert--  (Vertical Navigation Alert)  This message appears when a VNAV operation has been programmed on the ALT 2 page and the esti- mated time to start the climb or descent is approximately 90 seconds. This message serves as notification to select the ALT 2 page so that the VNAV operation may be executed.  This message does not appear if the  ALT 2 page is already being displayed.  VNAV status can also be dis-  played on the NAV 1 page.WPT Annunciator Fail-- This message appears when there is a failureof the KLN 89(B) WPT annunciator drive circuitry. To determine if way- point alerting is being given you will need to look at the KLN 89(B) display because the annunciator will not be working if this message has been given.  Service the KLN 89(B) as soon as possible.WPT _____ Deleted-- This message appears when a waypoint used in aflight plan, or the active waypoint, no longer exists as a result of updating the data base.  The blank space is filled in with the waypoint identifier.  The waypoint is deleted from flight plans in which it was used.AppendixB-6Message Page MessagesAppendix BAPPENDIX C - SCRATCHPAD MESSAGES NOTE: Those messages marked with a double dagger symbol (à) refer tothe KLN 89B only.ActiveWptÑ (Active Waypoint) Appears when you attempt to delete auser-defined waypoint on the OTH 4 page if the waypoint is the active waypoint (the waypoint you are navigating to). Another waypoint must be made the active waypoint before this waypoint can be deleted from the user-defined waypoint list.àD BaseExpireÐ (Data Base Expired)  Appears whenever the pilot attemptsto select an approach from the data base on the APT 8 or ACT 8 page and the data base has expired.àD>CRS XXX¡Ð (Direct To Course XXX¡)  Appears when the KLN 89B is inthe OBS mode and is interfaced with an external indicator for which the KLN 89B cannot change the selected course and the pilot per- forms a Direct To operation.  Since the KLN 89B cannot change the selected course to the direct to course, the KLN 89B gives you this message telling you the OBS value that will take the aircraft direct to the active waypoint.DupIdentÑ (Duplicate Identifier) Appears when you select a waypointidentifier on one of the waypoint type pages if there is more than one waypoint of that waypoint type having the same identifier.àFpl IsFullÐ (Flight Plan is Full)  Appears when an attempt is made to add anew waypoint to the active flight plan (FPL 0) when it already contains 20 waypoints and the first waypoint is part of the active leg. Change the active waypoint or delete another waypoint before adding any more waypoints.àInvaldAddÐ (Invalid Add)  Appears when an attempt is made to add a newwaypoint into the approach.  Approach procedures must be flown as they are stored in the data base.àInvaldDel Ð (Invalid Delete ) Appears when an attempt is made to delete  an  approach waypoint.     Individual approach waypoints cannot bedelet ed, you must delete or replace the entire approach.Invald EntÑ (Invalid Entry) Appears when you attempt to enter data whichis not a valid entry.  For example, trying to enter a date of 30 FEB 95.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAppendix C-1Scratchpad MessagesAppendix CNo ActWptÑ (No Active Waypoint) Appears when you attempt to activate the OBS mode if there is no active waypoint. To have an active way- point, a flight plan must be activated or a Direct To must be initiated.àNo AprIn FplÐ (No Approach in Flight Plan)  Appears when an attempt is made to arm the GPS approach mode when there is no approach loaded into the active flight plan. Load an approach into the flight plan before trying to arm the approach mode.àNoIntcptÐ (No Intercept)  Appears when an attempt is made to recalcu- late the intercept point on a DME arc and the actual track does not intercept with the arc. Change the track (heading) of the aircraft so that the actual track does intercept the DME arc and try again.No NrstÐ (No Nearest)  Appears when the pilot selects a nearest list (APT, VOR, NDB, INT, USR, SUA, FSS or CTR), and there are no nearest items of that type within a 200 nm radius of the aircraft Õs pre-sent position.NoSuchWptÑ (No Such Waypoint) Appears when there is no waypoint in the data base corresponding to the entered identifier on the Supplemental Waypoint page.RemrksFullÑ (Remarks Full) Appears when you attempt to create a user- entered Airport or Supplemental Waypoint remark on the APT 6 or SUP 3 page if 100 user-entered remarks already exist.  In order to  create additional airport remarks, some existing remarks must be deleted on the OTH 4 page.UsedIn FplÑ (Used in Flight Plan) Appears when you attempt to delete a user-defined waypoint on the OTH 4 page if the waypoint is used in a flight plan.  Either this waypoint must be deleted from the flight plan or the entire flight plan must be deleted before this waypoint can be deleted from the user-defined waypoint list.USR DBFullÑ (User Data Base Full) Appears when you attempt to create a user-defined waypoint if the user data base already contains 500 waypoints.  In order to create additional user-defined waypoints, it will  first be necessary to delete existing user-defined waypoints on the  OTH 4 page.AppendixC-2Scratchpad MessagesAppendix CAPPENDIX D - ABBREVIATIONS STATE ABBREVIATIONS ABBREVIATIONSTATEAKAlaska ALAlabama  ARArkansas  AZArizona  CACalifornia  COColorado  CTConnecticut  DCDistrict of Columbia  DEDelaware  FLFlorida  GAGeorgia  IAIowa  IDIdaho  ILIllinois  INIndiana  KSKansas  KYKentucky  LALouisiana  MAMassachusetts  MDMaryland  MEMaine  MIMichigan  MNMinnesota  MOMissouri  MSMississippi  MTMontana  NCNorth Carolina  NDNorth Dakota  NENebraska  NHNew Hampshire  NJNew Jersey  NMNew Mexico  NVNevada  NYNew York  OHOhio  OKOklahoma KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAppendix D-1AbbreviationsAppendix DSTATE ABBREVIATIONS (ContÕd) OROregon PAPennsylvania  RIRhode Island  SCSouth Carolina  SDSouth Dakota  TNTennessee  TXTexas  UTUtah  VAVirginia  VTVermont  WAWashington  WIWisconsin  WVWest Virginia  WYWyoming CANADIAN PROVINCE ABBREVIATIONS ABBREVIATIONPROVINCEABAlberta  BCBritish Columbia  MBManitoba  NBNew Brunswick  NFNewfoundland  NSNova Scotia  NT & NUNorthwest Territory  ONOntario  PEPrince Edward Island  PQQuebec  SKSaskatchewan  YKYukon COUNTRY ABBREVIATIONS ABBREVIATIONCOUNTRYAFGAfghanistan  AGOAngola  AIAAnguilla Isl.

The system is, however, avail-  able to all civilian users free of charge.  GPS provides extremely  precise position, velocity, and time information.The satellites are not geosynchronous, as is the case with manyweather and television satellites.  That is, each satellite is not above a fixed spot on the Earth all the time, but rather is continuously moving across the sky.  In fact, each satellite completely orbits the Earth two  times per day.The Department of Defense imposes an intentional accuracy degra-dation of the GPS system.  This degradation is known as Selective  Availability (SA).  When SA is active, only U.S. military users have  access to full GPS accuracy.  For civilian users, position accuracy is  degraded to no worse than 100 meters.  At the time of this writing,  Selective Availability is on (and therefore accuracy is degraded) near- ly 100% of the time.GPS POSITION DETERMINING CONCEPTThe technique used to determine position is fundamentally very sim-ple.  The complicated part is accounting for and correcting all the  possible errors in the position.The GPS receiver is able to determine the time it takes a radio signalto travel from the satellite to the GPS antenna.  Since this radio signal travels at the speed of light (approximately 186,000 statute miles per second), the time delay can very easily be used to determine the receiverÕs distance from a given satellite.  If measurements are taken from four satellites (or three satellites and an input from an aircraft altimeter), the receiver can identify its position very precisely.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAppendix F F-1GPS PrimerAppendix FFor example, the GPS receiver might determine that it is exactly12,000 miles from satellite A, 12,700 miles from satellite B, and 13,100 miles from satellite C.  At the same time, the aircraft Õs encod-ing altimeter might be indicating an altitude of 9,500 feet MSL.  There  is only one point in space that satisfies these four measurements.GPS DATA SIGNALS Two of the primary types of signals that the GPS satellites broadcast are almanac and ephemeris data.  These signals enable the GPS  receiver to quickly lock on to the satellites in view.  Otherwise, the  receiver would have to look for each of the 24 satellites to determine which ones could be used.Almanac data is very crude data which describes the approximateorbital position of the satellites.  Each of the 24 satellites transmits the almanac data for all satellites, so a GPS receiver has only to listen to one satellite in order to know which satellites are ÒvisibleÓ (in the sky) at that particular time.  Almanac data is good for about six months, so  when you turn the receiver off, then back on a month later, it will know what satellites to look for.Ephemeris data is very precise data which each satellite transmits totell the GPS receiver exactly where it is and what its orbital parame- ters will be for about the next four hours.  Each satellite transmits its  own unique ephemeris data.Appendix FF-2GPS PrimerAppendix F12,000 NM12,700 NM13,100 NM9500 FTMSLNOT TO SCALEN65108GPS SYSTEM SEGMENTSThe GPS system is composed of three segments: the SpaceSegment, the Control Segment, and the User Segment.The Space Segment consists of the 24 NAVSTAR satellites which orbit the earth at an altitude of 10,898 nautical miles. The satellite orbits are very precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the GPS system 24 hours a day, every day.  There  are almost always more than six satellites in view from anywhere on Earth.The Control Segment consists of a network of ground-based monitor-ing and control stations.  The Master Control Station is located in  Colorado Springs, Colorado.  All satellite data which is collected by  the other ground stations is assimilated and analyzed at Colorado  Springs.  Based on these analyses, ephemeris updates (such as sys-  tem clock corrections) are sent (uplinked) to the satellites through  radio transmitters at the ground stations.  These ground stations are  located at Kwajalein (west of Hawaii in the central Pacific Ocean), Diego Garcia (in the Indian Ocean), and Ascension (in the south Atlantic Ocean).As an owner of a GPS system, you can now claim to be a certifiedmember of the GPS User Segment!  GPS has many users and uses,  and more are being dreamed up all the time.  Not only are aircraft  using GPS navigation, so are military systems and personnel, boaters, hikers, and surveyors.  Personal automobiles and transport  trucks use Intelligent Transportation Systems, or ITS, to find their destinations, and track their movements.  Some biologists attach  GPS receivers to animals to monitor their movement and migration patterns.  Geologists even use GPS to track the movement of glaci-  ers and to analyze plate tectonics (movements of the EarthÕs crust).What an exciting new technology as we move into the 21st Century!RAIMReceiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is a function that every IFR-certified GPS receiver must continuously perform to assure an accurate position.  One characteristic of the GPS Space and  Control Segments is that they canÕt instantly fix a satellite if it beginssending misleading positioning information.  For this reason, a GPS  receiver canÕt rely on the GPS satellites to tell it when there is a pos-sible error.  The words  Òreceiver autonomousÓ indicate that the GPS KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAppendix F F-3GPS PrimerAppendix Freceiver, on itÕs own, can detect an inaccuracy in the GPS system.  It does this by using distance measurements from as many satellites as possible to check the consistency of the position (this is called an over-determined position solution).If there are not enough satellites in view to assure the position integri-ty, the KLN 89(B) notifies the pilot.  Five measurements with good  geometry (relative positions of the satellites) are needed to provide  RAIM.  This means that at least five satellites or four satellites and a  pressure altitude input from the aircraftÕs altimeter are required toassure RAIM availability. Likewise, if this check shows some incon- sistency in the position, the KLN 89(B) notifies the user that other navigation sources should be used to cross-check the position.  Additionally, sometimes the receiver is unable to assure the position to enough accuracy for the phase of flight, due to the location of the satellites at that instant.RAIM availability is very seldom a difficulty when in the en route andterminal phases of navigation.  The allowable limits are much tighter  when a non-precision approach is performed with a KLN 89B.  For  this reason, the KLN 89B Other (OTH) 3 page allows the pilot to enter a time and location, and the GPS receiver will predict if RAIM will be available to shoot the non-precision approach.  See section 5.1.9 for  more information about the RAIM prediction capability.GPS XPRESSªCARD 8-CHANNEL RECEIVER The KLN 89 and KLN 89B use an Honeywell GPS receiver known as the GPS Xpressªcard.  It was dubbed this way because it is identi- cal in size to an everyday credit card, and its faster acquisition time than previous single-channel designs.  The GPS receiver has eight  parallel channels, which means each channel can continuously track a satellite, for continuous tracking of up to eight GPS satellites.  The  parallel receiver design has several advantages:¥Excellent performance during high dynamic conditions (highvelocity and/or acceleration).¥Improved position acquisition time (also known as time-to-first-fix) over single-channel designs.¥Improved position accuracy.¥The ability of the GPS receiver to perform the RAIM calcula- tions is enhanced without degrading position tracking.Appendix FF-4GPS PrimerAppendix FKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideIndex I-1IndexKLN 89(B) INDEXAAbbreviations Airport names 3-25, 3-45 ARTCC/FIR D-8 Canadian Province D-2  Communication frequencies 3-49 Country D-2  GPS receiver state 3-62 Other abbreviations D-17 State D-1  Time zones 3-5ACT (Active waypoint pages) 4-11 Activating Numbered flight plan 4-4 Waypoint in the OBS mode 4-39Actual track 3-38, 3-43, A-1 Adding waypoints to flight plan 4-2 Air data pages 4-44 Airport data Bearing and distance 3-46 City, State (or country) 3-45 Communication frequencies 3-49 Fuel availability 3-47 Identifier 2-4 Instrument approach availability 3-47 Latitude/longitude 3-46 Military 3-45 Name 3-45 Nearest 3-27, 3-46 Radar capability 3-47 Remarks 3-50 Runway information 3-48Airport waypoint pages 3-45 Airspeed 4-27, 4-28 Alarm 4-26 Alerting Altitude 4-14 Special Use Airspace (SUA) 3-68 Voltage, avionics bus 3-67 Waypoint 3-35, 4-9Almanac 3-18, 3-63, F-2Altitude Alerting 4-14 Density 4-27 Indicated 3-2, 3-58, 4-26 Input 1-1, 3-58 Minimum en route safe (ESA) 3-59 Minimum safe (MSA) 3-59 Pages 3-58, 4-14, 4-17 Pressure 3-58, 4-26, 4-27, 4-28Annunciators, remote 3-66, 5-1 Antenna 1-1  Approach active (ACTV) mode 5-4 Approach armed (ARM) mode 5-4 Approaches Changing 5-9 Deleting 5-9 Loading 5-6 Selecting 5-5APT 1 Name, City page 3-45 APT 2 Lat, Lon, distance page 3-46 APT 3 Airspace, timezone, apr type page 3-47 APT 4 Runways, Rnwy length page 3-48 APT 5 VHF frequencies page 3-49 APT 6 pilot remarks page 3-50 APT 7 departures, arrivals page 3-51 APT 8 approaches page 3-52 ARTCC (ÒCenterÓ) Abbreviations D-8 Frequencies 3-31AUTO map scale 3-42, 5-21 Autopilot 1-1 BBaro set 3-2, 3-58 Battery 2-8 Bearing to waypoint 3-36, 3-38, 3-45 Brightness;

OPERATIONAL EVALUATION    5.1  History   The airplane was originally developed in Israel and certified both in Israel and the USA as   IAI-1126/GALAXY in December 1998. After it™s cert ification, the FAA conducted a FSB evaluation of  the IAI Galaxy, but this evaluation was of a limited  scope, i.e. Type Rating determination, training,  checking and currency requirements.    General Dynamics, parent company of Gulfstream Aerospace, acquired the IAI Galaxy in 2001 and   the aircraft was renamed Gulfstream G200. Significant modifications to the airplane were introduced  over the years, which followed.  Gulfstream applied for and obtained an EASA Type Certificate in 2004.    Gulfstream™s G200 is manufactured in Israel and flown to Dallas, TX for the final phase before delivery  to clients (ﬁcompletionﬂ).       5.2  Overview   The G200 is a swept wing executiv e aircraft, designed for a maximum of 18 passengers, however, a  typical outfitting is for 8-10 passengers and 2 cockpit crew.     The MTOW  of the G200 is 16,080 kg (35,450 lbs) in the basic AFM  or 16,170 kg (35,650 lb under  Supplement 12). It is capable of cruise speeds up to Mach 0.85 (M mo) at a maximum altitude of 45,000  ft MSL.      The aircraft is equipped with two Pratt & Whitney 306A engines. Take off thrust rating is 6040 pounds  per engine. The engines incorporate a Digital Electr onic Engine Control system and thrust reversers,  while an Auto-Throttle system is optional equipment.    The cockpit is equipped with a Collins ProLine 4 EFIS system and dual Collins FMS    5.3  Process    The catch-up evaluation of the G200 consis ted of a number of distinct steps:    Evaluation             Completion of draft report      Presentation of draft report   Incorporate comments.   These steps were completed in July-August 2008.      The evaluation  was performed by obtaining information on Type Rating training courses already  approved and in use and comparing the outline of these courses with the requirements in JAR-FCL  and EU-OPS.    After this evaluation, a  draft  report  was completed and distributed to prepare for the formal  presentation.    The manufacturer was invited to raise comments on the draft report.  These comments were  incorporated  in the final version of the report.   The JOEB should be involved in conducting future  evaluations of the G200 aircraft, its derivatives and  of all changes to the aircraft, such as software modifications and/or the addition of new systems. The   Board will then determine the associated impact on  training, checking and currency and will amend  this report accordingly.

In accordance with the provisions in JAR-FCL a Single License Endorsement is assigned to   the G200. The License Endorsement is:  G200.    2.  The initial Type Rating training course as described in paragraph 8 is recommended for  approval as a minimum.   3. Special attention should be given to the pre-requisite requirements for candidate-pilots.    4.  Some items require special emphasis during training. They are mentioned in paragraph 10.   6. An EASA/JAA MMEL was not offered for evaluation during this JOEB process. The FAA    MMEL is available for consultation on the website www.opspecs.com .

INITIAL TYPE RATING TRAINING COURSE   8.1 TRAINING   The G200 Type Rating training course was evaluated.   The training course, which is described in more  detail in APPENDIX 3 is recommended by EASA/JAA  as the minimum for initial Type Rating qualification training and checking (JAR-FCL), as well as for the  relevant portion of Conversion training and checking (EU-OPS).  The course was verified to fulfill the requirements  of JAR-FCL AMC 1.261 (c) (2) in an acceptable way .   This Type Rating training course is an intense and demanding course. Additional training should be  considered for pilots without any previous experience with EFIS and FMS.   The safe operation of the airplane is predicated upon  the awareness, at all times and of both pilots, of  the airplane™s Flight Modes and flight parameters.  Strict adherence to Crew Coordination Procedures  (CCP™s) in normal, as well as in abnormal situations is essential and should be regarded as  mandatory. These CCP™s, specific to aircraft type and to operator, should be fully integrated in the   training. The Training Organization, therefore, should be made aware of the specific Crew  Coordination Procedures as established by the operator, before training is started. Pilots having no  relevant experience with the app lication of Crew Coordination Proc edures will benefit from a bridge- course on this topic.   Pilots having no relevant experience with the operation of an integrated Avionics, Flight Management  System and Flight Guidance System, like the Collins Pr o-Line 4 suite, will benefit from a bridge-course  on this topic.   These specific additional courses should ideally be completed before the Full Flight Simulator training  phase.      Emergency procedures are an essential part of the training curriculum. To avoid confusion during  training, as well as during actual operations, the Training Organization and the candidate pilots need   to be made aware of the items to be performed without immediate reference to the checklist. These  steps should be defined before training is started,  preferably by the operator as part of its Standard  Operating Procedures.   Further areas of special emphasis are covered in a separate paragraph (10).     EASA/JAA recommends to include Line Flying Under Supervision in the conversion training program  and to follow the requirements of EU-OPS 1.945, including Appendix 1 (Conversion training and  checking) and EU-OPS 1.955 (Nomination as commander).       8.2 CHECKING    Ground school examination and Type Rating skill test  have to comply with JAR-FCL 1.240, 1.261 and  1.262 and the related appendices.      8.3 FLIGHT SIMULATOR   One of the two  G200 Flight Simulators at FlightSafety in Dallas, TX was evaluated in January/February   2008 by an evaluation team of Germany (LBA).

SPECIAL EMPHASIS TRAINING    The JOEB has identified several aircraft systems and/or procedures (listed below) that should receive  special emphasis in an approved G200 Training Program:   Systems Integration Training:   Primary Flight Display (PFD).   EICAS.   Flight Guidance System (FGS).   Flight Management System (FMS).    Flight Training (Full Flight Simulator - Level C or D and/or aircraft):   Dual Generator Failure procedure.   Loss of cabin pressure procedures.   Instrument flying on standby instruments   Fuel leaks.   Smoke procedures, including smoke removal    The JOEB recommends early exposure to the FCP, FMA and FMS, especially for pilots with no  previous EFIS or FMS experience. Establishing ear ly confidence in manually flying the aircraft,  converting from manual to automatic (FMS controlled) flight mode and back is equally important due to   heavy reliance on the Automatic Flight Control System  (AFCS). In the event of a flight path deviation  due to input error or system malfunction, the flight crew must be able to comfortably transition from  automatic to manual mode and back in an orderly fashion.

RECURRENT TRAINING/CHECKING   Recurrent training and currency serve to maintain a pilot™s continued competency for the operational  tasks to be performed. During proficiency checks this competency is established.   It is every operator™s responsibility to establish a recurrent training and proficiency checking program,  approved by the National Authority, which is relevant to the type of airplane and the intended  operation.    The requirements for a recurrent training program may vary with several factors which have a  significant influence. Some of these factors are: actu al exposure of the flight crew member(s), specific  routes and aerodromes used by the operator and new developments in technology. These factors  and/or a combination thereof will determine how much recurrent training will actually be required.    It is recommended to follow the requirements of EU-OPS, subpart N, paragraph 1.965 as a minimum  and to consider expansion, as appropriate, of these requirements for pilots, who have had only limited  exposure and/or who do not any longer fulfill the currency requirements.

Readers   and front line managers who may need or want more details of  the problem, research and analysis, and a complete listing of  findings and recommendations can refer to the full report that  follows. 3.1 The Go-Around Noncompliance Problem Approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for   aviation accidents, accounting annually for approximately 65  percent of all accidents. A Flight Safety Foundation study of  16 years of runway excursions determined that 83 percent  could have been avoided with a decision to go around. In  other words, 54 percent of  all accidents could potentially be  prevented by going around. It is generally felt that an unstable   approach is the primary cause of landing excursions. However,  within this 16-year period, just over half of the landing excur -sions followed a fully stable approach; in these instances,  the flight became unstable only during landing. A critical  industry policy designed to help prevent such accidents is  the go-around policy. Interestingly, and sadly, the collective  industry performance of complying with go-around policies  is extremely poor Š approximately 3 percent of unstable  approaches result in go-around policy compliance. Why is a  critical policy designed to prevent the most common type of  accident ignored by flight crews, and why is that policy not  being managed effectively by management? Improving the   go-around compliance rate holds tremendous potential in re -ducing approach and landing accidents (ALAs). The go-around   itself is not without risk. There is an increased risk in loss of  control events during a go-around compared to exposure with  all other phases of flight. It follows that we should only go  around when the risk associated with an unstable approach  is greater than the risk associated with a go-around. What is  that balance, and how do we minimize go-around exposure to  only those that are really necessary? The Flight Safety Foun -dation Go-Around Decision-  Making and Execution Project was  launched to research and answer the question ﬁWhy are we  so poor at complying with established go-around policies?ﬂ It  was also intended to improve our understanding of the risks  associated with executing go-arounds and to make recom -mendations to improve compliance and mitigate risks associ -ated with the go-around maneuver itself. The full report includes complete research, analysis, find -ings, strategies and recommendations for industry corrective   action, and future work required. As such, it is meant as a  source for the development of easier-to-use operator refer -ence products such as guidelines and checklists. 3.2 Research and Analysis Many ALAs have been investigated thoroughly over time, and   much is known about contributing factors. What is lacking,  however, is an understanding of the psychology of noncompli -ance. Research and analysis of go-around decision making   have been conducted primarily from the psychosocial science  perspective to gain an understanding of the psychological  drivers of noncompliance, and to identify corrective steps that  can be taken, based on science. This is the first industry analy -sis of its type for this specific problem. The Presage Group   conducted the research and analysis, based on its situational   model of nine distinct constructs, or attributes, from two  global studies via web-based surveys; one survey analyzed  the psychology of noncompliance by flight crewmembers, and  the other examined the psychology of management™s actions  in handling company go-around policies. Detailed analysis can  be found in the full report. For the go-around execution research, an accident and  incident review was conducted that included a non-random  selection of published accident and serious incident re -ports about go-around events involving transport category  aircraft between 2000 and 2012. A total of 64 go-around  events were included. In some, the safety of the go-around  was central to the accident or incident investigation; in oth -ers, the aftermath of the go-around was the main purpose of  the investigation. The events involved single-aisle jets (64  percent), twin turboprops (20 percent) and twin-aisle jets  (16 percent). The context, safety aspects and overall level of risk of each  event were analyzed and characterized by a review team.   Each event was assigned to one of three categories according  to the degree of risk presented by the go-around: high risk (18  events), moderate risk (25 events) and nonŒrisk-bearing (21  events). In the two risk-bearing categories, six ﬁheadlineﬂ go-around  safety issues (GASIs) were identified with respect to the initia -tion and conduct of each go-around. Most of the 43 risk-  bearing  events were associated with a single GASI, but five events were  associated with two GASIs. Each risk-bearing event also was  assigned one of three ﬁoutcome risksﬂ: loss of controlŒin flight,  controlled flight into terrain or midair collision. 3.3 Significant Findings An effective policy has three main attributes: It is well thought   out and clearly written to balance the needs of safety and  4 |mission accomplishment; company management handles the  policy consistently; and company front line employees™ aware -ness is such that the policy is carried out reliably. Research   revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the industry,  operator and employee levels. High-level significant findings are: 1. The collective industry norm is to accept the noncompli -ance of go-around polices, despite empirical data that   indicate this is the most common contributor to ALAs. 2. The industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable   approaches as the sole means to reduce ALAs, even  though empirical data show that unstable approaches  affect less than half of runway excursions. 3. Pilots™ overall awareness of ALA risks Š and of the impact   those risks have on approach and landing safety Š is low. 4. Management is generally disengaged from go-around  noncompliance and has low awareness of the impact it   has on ALAs. Management™s perception of risk is low. 5. Pilots do not see current go-around policy criteria as   realistic for the operational environment. 6. Effective go-around decision making in flight deck com - munication is low. 7. Go-arounds, although considered a normal flight maneu -ver, are rare. 8. As reported by flight crews, one in 10 go-arounds has a   potentially hazardous outcome, such as an aircraft perfor -mance exceedance. 9. There are variable go-around techniques and challenges,  depending on the point during the approach when the go- around begins. Procedures and training do not adequately   address many of these challenges. 10. Pilot experience in the aircraft type affects go-around   proficiency. 11. Go-around complexity, including complex controller radio   transmissions, can affect go-around proficiency. 3.4 Recommendations It is evident that the state of noncompliance has been steady   for many years and will remain steady unless changes are  made. First and foremost, the industry must improve its  awareness of the problem; a shift in focus and cultural norms  is required. It is believed that significant improvement is  attainable; however, the cultural shift will be easier if the  industry shifts collectively, as opposed to individual compa -nies attacking the issue on their own, as several are already   doing. As stated above, three key attributes of an effective policy  are: The policy makes operational sense to both the employees   who execute it and those who manage it; the policy is managed  effectively to a level that satisfies company objectives; and the  employees who should follow the policy are very aware of that  policy and the environment in which it is applied. As such, the   following recommendations touch upon these key attributes.  More detailed recommendations can be found in the full report. High-level strategic recommendations for go-around decision  making include the following: 1. Ensure the policy makes sense operationally. a. Update the stable approach definition and stable ap -proach height to maximize their relevance among flight  crews, and their manageability among management. b. Separate the stable approach definition and criteria   from decision-making criteria to improve aware -ness that these are two distinct aspects of go-around  policies, and that decision making is viable beyond  the defined approach phase. This separation does not   imply that these two distinct areas cannot meet at  points throughout the approach and landing; rather, it  is intended for developers of standard operating pro - cedures and communication procedures to break the  psychological attachment of these two aspects. 3. Manage the policy effectively. a. Operators set specific compliance rate targets (key  performance indicators), and establish initiatives to  achieve them. b. Amend industry and regulatory audit programs to   include standards and recommended practices that  address go-around noncompliance (GANC). 3. Increase situational awareness. a. Increase awareness of GANC and risks associated with  continuing to land when unstable, and the significant  impact that noncompliance has on ALAs among:i. Operator management; ii. Flight crews; iii. Industry and pilot associations;iv.  Regulators; and, v. Manufacturers. b. Enhance situational awareness (psychosocial aware -ness) to heighten flight crews™ awareness throughout  the approach and landing through: i. Policy and procedural enhancements; 5 |ii. Communication improvements; and, iii. Minimizing the subjectivity of go-around decision  making for the decision maker (e.g., the pilot flying  or captain) to mitigate those components of situ -ational awareness that compromise the pilot™s risk   assessment and decision-making ability. Each recommendation helps improve the psychological driv -ers that affect good decision making, and it is this objec -tive that the recommendations were specifically designed   to address. Although all strategic recommendations are  important and should be implemented as part of a holistic  approach, a few are worth highlighting. First, if an operator  has the means to install automated stable approach and land -ing alerting systems, it should be a priority. These systems   address many of the psychological issues associated with  noncompliance and could be the single most effective way  to improve go-around decisions. Second, management must  be more involved in managing the policy/problem Š an area   where management has been very much absent. Key steps  to be taken by management are to set go-around compliance  rate targets consistent with safety management system prin -ciples, and to investigate and follow up (non-punitively) on   each approach that continues to an unstable landing. Finally,  flight crew situational awareness needs to be improved Š  primarily through better communication throughout the  approach and landing, which can be achieved largely through  active communication techniques as part of standard operat -ing procedures. High-level strategic go-around execution recommendations: 1. Ensure that go-around training and awareness appropri -ately reflect different go-around execution risk scenarios. 2. Review go-around policy, procedures and documen -tation to maximize their effectiveness, clarity and   understanding.3. Ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew  does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitoring during   approach, landing and go-around. As with any significant program change, desired, and  undesired, effects should be closely monitored by appropri -ate audit programs such as flight data analysis (FDA), line  operations safety audits (LOSA) or International Air Trans -port Association (IATA) Operational Safety Audits (IOSA). 3.5 Action Taken In light of the findings and recommendations, it is appar -ent that revisions are required to Flight Safety Foundation™s  ﬁRecommended Elements of a Stabilized Approachﬂ and  Safe  Landing Guidelines . Analysis indicates there are facets of that  guidance that are not optimal for effective decision making   and that may encourage go-arounds for approaches that may  be of very low risk. When this report was being published, the  analysis for such revisions had already taken place, but the  project review committee recommended an operational trial  before changes in the Foundation™s guidelines are formally   adopted. (See Appendices 10.3 and 10.4 for Flight Safety Foun -dation™s ﬁNew Stabilized Approach and Go-Around Guidelines,   2017 (proposed for industry validation)ﬂ and ﬁRevised Safe  Landing Guidelines, 2017 (proposed for industry validation).ﬂ 3.6 Project Conclusion (Executive Report) The problem of go-around policy noncompliance is real and is  arguably the greatest threat to flight safety today, and the po -tential impact of improvement in compliance is significant. No   other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction  of aviation accidents as the decision to go around. The industry must improve its awareness of the problem;  to accomplish that, a shift in focus and cultural norms is  required. It is believed that significant improvement is attain -able; however, the cultural shift will be much easier if the in -dustry shifts collectively, as opposed to individual companies   taking individual action. However, several companies already  have chosen to go it alone on this issue. The project accomplished the goals of the 2011 document  that outlined the terms of Flight Safety Foundation™s Go-Around  Safety Initiative Š ﬁto understand the noncompliance by flight  crewmembers, and noncompliance of quality control measures  by flight managers,ﬂ and to consider the safety risk associ -ated with go-arounds and ensure that the transfer of risk is   understood. There are several useable guidelines in the appendix of  the report. Not all envisioned products have been completed,   however, and this is noted in the report as work yet to be done  by Flight Safety Foundation. 6 |4 Background 1  Curtis, William. IAC meeting. Boeing, Seattle. 2008. presentation In 2008, Flight Safety Foundation™s International Advisory  Committee (IAC) was briefed 1 about concerns that go- arounds often were not being conducted when an unstable  approach occurred below the stable approach height (SAH).   The ensuing discussion concluded in agreement that the issue  should be studied further. Interestingly, the Foundation™s Eu -ropean Advisory Committee (EAC) began its own discussion   related to go-arounds, the lack of unstable approach policy  compliance, the risk of the go-around maneuver itself, and  what effect air traffic services (ATS) providers could have on  the issue. These discussions led the Foundation to look more   deeply into the empirical data supporting such concerns. Failure to conduct a go-around is the number one risk factor  in approach and landing accidents (ALAs) and the number one  cause of runway excursions (Burin, 2011: The Year in Review).  Recent analyses of data from 1994 through 2010 indicate  that 33 percent of all accidents are runway excursions, and  that they are the most common type of accident (Burin, 2011:  The Year in Review) (Tarrel). Unstable approaches occur  on 3.5 to 4.0 percent of all approaches, and 95 to 97 percent   of flight crews whose airplanes are in this state continue  the approach to landing (Burin, 2011: The Year in Review)  (Klinect) (Pursey, Evidence Based Training). In ﬁAnalysis of  Approach and Landing Accidents and Serious Incidentsﬂ Š  one of several studies conducted by Flight Safety Foundation™s  Approach and Landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Task Force  and published by the Foundation in 1999 Š the task force con -ducted an in-depth analysis of 76 accidents and incidents that   occurred from 1984 through 1997. The task force found that a   go-around was initiated in only 17 percent of the occurrences  and said that ﬁgiven the evidence – analysts expected the  initiation of a higher number of go-arounds in practiceﬂ (Flight  Safety Foundation ALAR Task Force). Approximately 65 percent of all accidents are ALAs (W.  F. Curtis) (IATA). One analysis concluded that more than 80  percent of ALAs would have been preventable Š if the crew  had decided to go around (Burin, 2011: The Year in Review).  Simply calculated, potentially about half of  all accidents could  be prevented with a decision to go around. No other single de -cision can have such an impact on the overall aviation accident   rate. Although all of these studies are somewhat subjective,  the consistencies from study to study indicate the problem is  real and is of the magnitude the studies indicate. Clearly, a go- around decision can yield great benefits, but what about the   risks associated with the go-around maneuver itself? There is no shortage of informative studies that have ana -lyzed what occurred during ALAs and what factors contrib -uted to the accidents. However, no known study has examined   flight crew decision making from a psychological perspective  to determine why some crews continued with an unstable  approach, knowingly violating company policies, and why oth -ers elected to go around. What are the drivers of intentional  noncompliance with a critical safety policy? The ALAR Task Force™s analysis of approach and landing  accidents and serious incidents identified ﬁpoor professional   judgment/airmanshipﬂ (i.e. decision making) as the most fre -quent casual factor, occurring in 74 percent of the 76 events.   Another form of poor decision making Š ﬁpress-on-itis,ﬂ or  continuing an approach when conditions suggest otherwise  Š accounted for 42 percent of all occurrences (Flight Safety  Foundation ALAR Task Force). More questions arise about the actions, or inactions, of  company management in these events. If the data have been   consistent for many years, why have managers not been able  to correct the problem? With such a low industry compliance  rate, some basic questions about management™s role need to  be answered: Are they aware of the noncompliance rates, and  if so, then why have they been unable to mitigate or improve  compliance with established go-around policies? If they are  not concerned with the poor compliance rate, why not? Man -agement issues were not cited in any of the 13 conclusions of  the ALAR Task Force™s final ﬁAnalysis of Fatal Approach and  Landing Accidents.ﬂ However, in the Task Force™s conclusions  of a related study Š ﬁAnalysis of Approach and Landing Ac -cidents and Serious Incidentsﬂ Š ﬁcompany management fail -ureﬂ was identified as a circumstantial factor in 46 percent of  the occurrences (Flight Safety Foundation ALAR Task Force). Based on these analyses, better awareness of the problem,  and new questions, Flight Safety Foundation initiated the  Go-Around Decision-Making and Execution Project (2011). It   was designed as a joint EACŒIAC project, with each committee  focusing on one specific aspect of the issue; the IAC focused  on go-around decision making, and the EAC focused on the  performance of the go-around. 7 |5 Go-Around Decision Making 5.1 Flight Crew 5.1.1 Methodology and Information Collection The Presage Group was commissioned by Flight Safety Foun -dation to conduct research and analysis on the psychology of  factors contributing to intentional noncompliance. The basis  for much of the following comes from two studies conducted  by Presage Š one that analyzed the psychology of flight crew  decision making during unstable approaches, and another that  analyzed the psychology of company management decision  making pertaining to addressing noncompliance with com -pany go-around safety policies (Smith, Jamieson and Curtis,   Why Are Go-Around Policies Ineffective? The Psycology of De -cision Making During Unstable Approaches) (Smith, Jamieson  and Curtis, Why Are Go-Around Policies Ineffective? The View  From the Airline Manager™s Desk). Although the issue extends  beyond unstable approaches, the studies were conducted on  this phase of flight as data were readily attainable from flight  crews. A psychological survey was developed that used unique  questioning and experimental methodologies to understand  the causation of compliant versus noncompliant flight crew   go-around decision making. These techniques included assess -ing pilots™ experiences using a series of questions designed   to explore the psychological precursors of risk assessment  and decision making. A second survey was designed to assess  the perceptions, beliefs and experiences of airline manag -ers and safety and operational personnel regarding unstable   approaches and how they are managed at their host compa -nies. To fully understand the systemic roots and dynamics of   noncompliance with unstable approach policies across the   industry, the results of the managers study were compared  with those of the parallel flight crew study. 5.1.2 Flight Crew Event Recall Š Study Segmentation In this segment of the study, we asked pilots to recall recent  specific instances of unstable approaches, at or below SAH  (i.e., we asked for the  last instance  they had experienced). This  special ﬁsituated recallﬂ task elicited detailed descriptions   of their experiences during the minutes leading up to and  including a decision on whether to call for a go-around. These  experiences include subjective aspects (e.g., their situational  and risk assessments, felt social pressures, fatigue, beliefs  about their companies™ go-around policies, etc.) as well as  their psychological representations of the objective factors   characterizing the aircraft and the environment during their  approaches (e.g., flight instabilities, visual reference condi -tions, environmental and air traffic control [ATC] factors, etc.).   These variables constitute a full and in-depth recounting of  the objective factors and their resulting psychological states  during the critical time interval leading up to the decisions  Š states that were hypothesized to be the highly important  precursors of those decisions. In addition, to help refine the  analysis, pilots also reported a variety of basic demographic  information (e.g., rank, time on type, base of operations,   etc.) and flight operational characteristics (long haul versus  short haul operations, aircraft type, etc.). The content of the  entire survey was thoroughly reviewed, commented upon and  amended in accordance with the recommendations made by  members of the IAC and EAC and other expert advisory team  members. The pilots were divided into groups: Ł Those who only experienced continuing to land with an  unstable approach (UA group); Ł Those who only experienced a go-around (GA group); and, Ł Those who had experienced both go-around and unstable  approach events. Pilots in this group were randomly as -signed to one of two groups Š to recall a scenario in which  they had flown an unstable approach but did not call for a  go-around, or to recall a go-around event. This random experimental assignment allowed us to confi -dently identify objective and psychological situational factors   associated with noncompliance with go-around policies re -garding go-around decision making. Pilots who reported they   had only flown a go-around or an unstable approach recently  (i.e., in the last five years) recalled their last event of those  respective types. The main set of psychological and psychosocial factors  assessed was a differentiated set of nine facets of awareness  that ﬁunpackﬂ the concept of situational awareness in a com -prehensive and holistic way, giving a rich phenomenological  account of unstable approach and landing conditions as they  are lived, and providing useful and targeted guidance for mit -igations. This set of psychosocial awareness constructs (Pres -age Group) includes the aspects detailed in Table 1 (p. 8),  which comprise an inter-related system of mutual causation.  It was hypothesized that greater awareness on each of the  nine awareness dimensions would be associated with mak -ing better assessments of risk and decisions to go around;  in general, greater situational awareness competencies  Table 1 Glossary of Presage Situational Awareness Constructs (Pilots) Construct Name DescriptionA˜ective awareness (C1) ﬁGut feeling for threatsﬂ Pilot™s gut feeling for threats; seat of the pants experience,  which is characterized by an emotional, sensory experience   that triggers further cognitive analysis Anticipatory awareness (C2) ﬁSeeing the threatsﬂ Pilot™s ability to see and/or monitor real and potential threats  as they move and change over time and space Critical awareness (C3) ﬁRelying on experienceﬂ Pilot™s ability to draw from his or her personal and professional  experience bank to assess here-and-now events as ﬁnormalﬂ Task-empirical awareness (C4) ﬁKnowing the limitsﬂ Pilot™s expert knowledge of the operational envelope of his or  her equipment Functional awareness (C5) ﬁKnowing the instruments and  equipmentﬂ Pilot™s expert knowledge of how to read and translate what   his or her instruments say Compensatory awareness (C6) ﬁAdjusting to threatsﬂ Pilot™s ability to know how and when to compensate or adjust  correctly for present and anticipated future operational   conditions in order to ensure safe and compliant operations Hierarchical awareness (C7) ﬁKnowing the proceduresﬂ Pilot™s expert knowledge of operational procedures, their  order and correct sequencing Relational awareness (C8) ﬁKeeping each other safeﬂ Pilot™s ability to accurately assess and engage crewmember  relationships in a manner that protects safety and compliance Environmental awareness (C9) ﬁCompany support for safetyﬂ Pilot™s experience of how the company supports and  encourages safety and how this in turn shapes his or her   commitment to safe and compliant behavior Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation 8 |are associated with more operationally compliant decision  making. 5.1.3 Pilot Go-Around Thresholds Š Study Segmentation A second experiment was included in this survey, and we   report some findings below, but the details are too numer -ous to fully describe here. This experiment was designed to   uncover the environmental and physical instability param -eters that influence pilots™ perceptions of the risks inherent  in flying unstable approaches, and to examine when their  attention to these parameters affects their judgments about  when to call for go-arounds. In this study, pilots were pre -sented with a hypothetical flight scenario in which they were   randomly assigned to receive variations in the severity of the   risk associated with wind conditions, runway conditions/ braking action and runway length. They were then asked at  what degree of deviation, on five different flight parameters,  those variations would cause them to call for a go-around.  Pilots were instructed to report on their likelihood of calling  for a go-around, based on their own  personal  risk criteria, not  those of their companies or of the industry, on this set of five  flight parameters, and to do so at  different altitudes. This allowed  us to infer where on the flight  path different risk factors become  personally salient and important  as drivers of pilots™ judgments to  go around, and how these factors   might interact. The objective was to  determine whether there was basic  alignment between pilots™ percep -tions about when there is a need   to call for a go-around and general  company/industry policies about  when these instabilities necessitate  such a decision. In case of evidence  of any gaps between these two,   our goal was to use these data to  guide realistic recommendations  about changes in policy that might  bring them into alignment while  ensuring that safety would not be  compromised. To the extent that  pilots do not see current policies  as constituting a set of legitimately  unsafe conditions, they are likely   to ignore such standard operat -ing procedures (SOPs) and engage   in potentially riskier, noncompli -ant flight behaviors. This was an  experimentally based attempt to explore pilot perceptions of  what  should  constitute the conditions to go around, in  their  experienced judgment, and to begin to develop a view about   whether such beliefs could be or should be incorporated into  policy guidance and SOPs in a way that would help ensure   compliant, safe behavior. 5.1.4 Pilot Respondent Sampling Respondents to this survey were solicited through direct   communication with safety personnel at various pilot asso -ciations and FSF-member and non-member airlines globally,   as well as through various social media forums. The goal was  to invite and administer the online survey to as many pilots  as possible from around the world, representing a variety  of fleets, aircraft, flight operations, respondent experience  levels, cultures, physical geographies, and so on. Anonym -ity was assured to inspire honest and complete self-reports   of pilots™ experiences, as well as to stimulate participation.   The 2,340 pilots who completed the survey included those  with a good range of pilot experience on a variety of opera -tional types, as well as wide geographical representation,  9 |Table 2 Sample Characteristics  (n=2,340)Variable Category Percent of sample Gender Male 97Female 3Continent of  operations Africa 1Asia 25Europe 28North America 34Oceania 0South America 12First language Non-English56English44Initial training Non-military 74Military 26Current position Captain 66First o˚cer 33Relief pilot 1Flight hours (career) Median ˛10,000Range 200 Œ 31,000Aircraft operation Passenger 88Charter 4All cargo 7Corporate <1Inactive <1Type of operation Short-haul 62Long-haul 38Note : Percentages for some variables do not total 100 because of rounding. Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation suggesting our results can be generalized to pilots world -wide (Table 2). 5.2 Management Study In this study, we asked safety managers at major airlines Š  those with the authority to recommend or enact changes in  unstable approach criteria and policy/procedures, as well as  those responsible for day-to-day quality control of flight op -erations Š a series of questions regarding their views of the   safety practices, procedures and organizational cultures with -in which unstable approaches and go-arounds occur in their  own airline operations. Specifically, we asked such managers  about the rates of compliance with unstable approach policies  that they believed their airlines experienced, as well as the  compliance rates experienced by the commercial industry as  a whole. Beyond this basic knowledge, we asked whether they  were satisfied with their airline™s performance on compli -ance with their unstable approachŒgo-around policies and   procedures, and whether they thought them effective, about   their perceptions of the clarity and appropriateness of these  policies and procedures, about their beliefs that they had the  support (informational support and organizational approval)  to manage their company™s go-around rates, and about their  overall assessment of how urgently they believed that the  risks (if any) perceived in their go-around rates needed to  be addressed (if at all). The content of the entire survey was  thoroughly reviewed, commented upon and amended in ac -cordance with the recommendations made by members of the  IAC, the EAC and other expert advisory team members. As in the pilot study, the main set of psychological and  psychosocial factors assessed were included in a differenti -ated set of nine facets of awareness, ﬁunpackingﬂ  situational  awareness  in a comprehensive way, giving a phenomenological  account of how effectively, from a manager™s experience, they   are managing pilot compliance with the unstable approachŒ go-around policies. This set of psychosocial awareness  constructs (The Presage Group) includes the aspects detailed   in Table 3 (p. 10), which comprise an inter-related system of  mutual causation. Table 3 describes the nine facets in a con -text associated with a managerial role. 5.2.1 Management Respondent Sampling The managerial respondents whose participation was solic -ited for this Flight Safety FoundationŒsponsored survey were   contacted via email communication/invitations from the  Foundation, International Air Transport Association (IATA)  and Airlines for America (A4A), as well as by several airlines.  Anonymity was assured to inspire honest and complete self- reports of managers™ beliefs and opinions. As was true of the pilot sample, with the managers who  completed the survey, we achieved wide geographical  representation, suggesting that our results can perhaps be   generalized to management personnel worldwide (Table 4, p.  11); however, several caveats are explained below. In fact, the  distributions Š by gender, continent and language Š in the  managers™ sample were nearly identical to those in the pilots™  sample. While few directors completed the survey, there were  a sizeable number of mid- and senior-level managers in the  sample. However, a subsequent question about respondents™  roles and responsibilities within their airlines for recom -mending and leading change in unstable approachŒgo-around  policies and procedures revealed that only 63 percent of those  in the sample had such authority. Also included were respon -dents who were responsible for quality control of day-to-day  10 |Table 3 Glossary of Presage Situational Awareness Constructs (Management) Construct Name DescriptionA˜ective awareness (C1) ﬁGut feeling for threatsﬂ Manager™s gut feeling for threats; seat of the pants experience  or ﬁspider sense,ﬂ which is characterized by an emotional,   sensory experience that triggers further cognitive analysis Anticipatory awareness (C2) ﬁSeeing the threatsﬂ Manager™s ability to see and/or monitor real and potential  threats as they move and change over time Critical awareness (C3) ﬁRelying on experienceﬂ Manager™s ability to draw from personal and professional  experience to assess here-and-now events as ﬁnormalﬂ Task-empirical awareness (C4) ﬁKnowing the limitsﬂ Manager™s expert knowledge of the operational envelope of  his or her policies and procedures; in other words, knowing  the boundaries Functional awareness (C5) ﬁKnowing the performance  metricsﬂ Manager™s expert knowledge of how to read and translate   what data about his or her policies and procedures mean Compensatory awareness (C6) ﬁAdjusting to threatsﬂ Manager™s ability to know how and when to compensate or  adjust correctly for present and anticipated future operational   conditions to ensure safe, compliant operations Hierarchical awareness (C7) ﬁKnowing the proceduresﬂ Manager™s expert knowledge of operational policies,  procedures, their order and correct sequencing Relational awareness (C8) ﬁKeeping each other safeﬂ Manager™s ability to accurately assess how his or her actions  in managing the internal policies and procedures either   facilitate and protect safety and compliance or compromise   themEnvironmental awareness (C9) ﬁCompany support for safetyﬂ Manager™s experience of how the company supports and  encourages safety compliance and how this in turn shapes  his or her commitment to safe and compliant behavior or   adherence to the operational policies and practices Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation flight operations, irrespective of whether their role included  policy development or implementation. The considerable efforts that we made in our outreach and  engagement strategy for the survey garnered 880 unique  visits to the survey portal. We consider this number of hits to  be very good, indicating that the engagement strategy drove a  meaningful number of airline managers to the site. However,  of those visiting, only 164 (18.6 percent) completed the survey,  a response rate low in both absolute terms, and relative to the  rate of participation among pilots (34 percent), who were asked   to complete a much longer and more demanding survey. This  low response rate constitutes, we believe, the first evidence  pointing toward disengagement with the topic of unstable   approachŒgo-around policy and procedures among airline  flight operations personnel at the managerial level. This is  especially true when we consider that the original criterion for  inclusion in our final analysis stipulated that respondents must  be in a position to develop and influence unstable approachŒ go-around policies and procedures at their airlines by virtue  of their authority to recommend  or make changes. Based on this  inclusion criterion and an analysis  of respondents™ self-  reported roles  and responsibilities, we achieved a  sample of only 103 qualified respon -dents. To increase the sample size   for analysis, we widened the sample  frame to include those respondents  responsible for quality control of  day-to-day flight operations at their  airlines, even if they did not have  policy development responsibilities.  (Note: A thorough comparison of the   latter group with the original target  revealed no systematic differences  in their survey responses, justifying  their inclusion in the final sample.)  The study, therefore, reports the  results from 128 managers (78 per -cent of all survey respondents and   15 percent of survey site visitors). This low response rate essen -tially disallowed us from analyzing   data for a second, experimental  task of determining personal go- around thresholds for unstable  approach risk among managers,  similar to the pilots™ go-around  threshold experiment. Meanwhile,  in light of the low response rate, a  caveat must be issued for all other  results that we report below. That is because the normative  response to the survey invitation among managers worldwide  was to choose  not  to participate; therefore, we must question  whether this was a valid and reliable sample of managers.   That said, the results, although based on this small sample,  are highly suggestive of trends in managers™ perspectives on  unstable approachŒgo-around policies and procedures. While  we are unsure if the sample is, in fact, biased, our intuition  tells us that any sample bias, if present, would tend toward   having surveyed managers who are more engaged, aware and  concerned about the issue than those who are less so. If this is  true, these results may more likely over-represent the degree  of awareness and concern about unstable approachŒgo- around noncompliance that exists in the industry. 5.3 Industry Sensing Throughout the project, there have been numerous dis -cussions with operators, regulators, manufacturers and  11 |investigative bodies, and conference and meeting presenta -tions with follow-on conversations. Off-the-record accounts  from agencies not wishing to be identified indicate that, of  those that have tracked go-around compliance, rates are in  the range of those discussed above (3 to 5 percent), and that  they have been in that range for a protracted period of time.  The exceptions are a couple of airlines that indicated their go- around compliance rates approach 100 percent. Additionally, they say that their flight data acquisition  programs are set to report out when the number of stable   approach parameter exceedances is greater than one. The  U.S. Federal Aviation Administration™s (FAA™s) Aviation Safety  Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS)/flight operational  quality assurance (FOQA) definition says an unstable ap -proach occurs when more than two parameters are exceeded  between 1,000 ft above ground level (AGL) and 500 ft AGL,  or below 500 ft (The Mitre Corporation). Most unstable   approachŒgo-around policies require a go-around when one or  more parameters are exceeded. Often, the conversation begins with go-around policy non -compliance and expands to include discussions of unstable  approaches and how they can be prevented in order to mitigate  runway excursion ALAs. 5.4 Analysis: Pilot Decision Making 5.4.1 Overview of Results The design of this study enabled us to look at the differences   between those pilots who were compliant with their compa -nies™ policies and those who were not, according to objective   and subjective measures. Table 5 (p. 12) presents data for the  demographic, flight operational and objective factors present  in the unstable approach events reported by pilots. Table 6 (p.  13) shows results for the psychological measures taken, that  is, the Presage situational awareness variables, psychosocial  factors (fatigue, risk assessment, etc.) and crew interac -tions. Table 7 (p. 14) illustrates findings for the measures  of how pilots, in hindsight, evaluated the outcomes of their  decisions and what they perceived as the main influences on  their choices (i.e., personal, interpersonal, operational and  organizational). In these three tables, pilots are divided into four different  groups for comparison: 1. Go-aroundŒonly history/GA group (27 percent of  sample): pilots who reported they had only flown one or  more go-arounds in the last five years but no unstable  approaches; 2. Mixed history/GA group (16 percent): pilots who had   flown one or more go-arounds and one or more unstable  approaches in the last five years and who were randomly  assigned to recall their last go-around event; 3. Mixed history/UA group (36 percent): pilots who had   flown one or more go-arounds and one or more unstable  approaches in the last five years and who were randomly  assigned to recall their last unstable approach event; and 4. Unstable approachŒonly history/UA group (21 percent):  pilots who reported they had only flown one or more un -stable approaches in the last five years but no go-arounds. A comparison of groups 2 and 3 (a combined 52 percent of   the total sample) within each table represents one focus of  the analysis, as these pilots were the only ones randomly  assigned to groups.

Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation 15 |chronic factors that would otherwise be ﬁexperimentally con -foundedﬂ with their self-selection into a recall event condition  (go-around or unstable approach) because they had recently  experienced only that one type of event. Findings from a  comparison of these groups are conservative, and represent  situationally important factors associated with go-around  decision making, not pilot dispositional factors. However, pilot  tendencies and preferences associated with flying unstable  approaches are, of course, present in the aviation community,  and we will also point out in the data how such pilot disposi -tional factors may additionally contribute to noncompliance  with go-around SOPs. It is our belief that the best way to present the findings is to  describe how pilots™ noncompliant behavior is a function of a  decision-making process influenced by the in-flight aircraft  and environmental factors that shape pilots™ decisions, their  situational awareness competencies in encoding and inter -preting the cues they receive about these aircraft and envi -ronmental factors, their personal perceptions of risk and risk   tolerance that result, and their appetite for appropriate col -laborative conversation about risk during the approach as an   input to decision making. It is from both the pilots™ responses  within each of these four classes of variables, as well as the  interactions between the two pilots, that a complete descrip -tive, psychological profile for noncompliance emerges. 5.4.2 Pilot Situational Awareness Profile Situational awareness of his or her environment, in all its   facets, is the psychological prerequisite for a pilot to judge  risk and then to make a decision to maintain compliance and  safety in light of that judgment. This study used The Pres -age Group™s Situational Awareness Model for measuring and   interpreting the psychological and social factors that col -lectively make up situational awareness. Recall that within   this model, situational awareness comprises nine distinct  but interconnected and seamless aspects of awareness. Much  of our discussion will be framed around how each of these   aspects influences a pilot™s decision-making processes, singly  and in concert with one another, to remain compliant rather  than noncompliant. (We note in passing that the Presage  model classifies with an average 85 percent accuracy whether  pilots are describing an unstable approach and landing or  a go-around Š 88 percent for unstable approaches and 82  percent for go-arounds Š based only on its psychosocial  measurements and excluding any knowledge of the objective  factors present in the unstable approach scenarios reported.   This means that our assessment of the experience of aware -ness, as we have measured it, does a good job of predicting   pilots™ decision-making behavior Š far beyond a 50 percent  chance level of prediction). The results of this study revealed, as hypothesized, that on  all nine inter-related situational awareness factors, unstable   approach pilots were significantly less aware than go-around  pilots in the moments leading up to and including their go- around decision making Š that is, they were less aware of  their emotional responses to threat, less able to anticipate  risk, more overconfident in their ability to compensate for the  instability, and in less agreement with company SOPs, etc. In  other words, the unstable approachŒrecall pilots scored much  lower than did the go-aroundŒrecall pilots on every facet of   situational awareness assessed. Seven of these nine differ -ences held up statistically to the more rigorous analysis that   compared just the experimentally assigned go-around and un -stable approach pilots with one another. And eight of the nine   differences between the experimentally assigned go-around  and unstable approach pilots were even more pronounced  when comparing the GA-only and UA-only groups. It is meaningful to ask, ﬁHow does this awareness shape  a pilot™s perception of risk?ﬂ Put simply, a pilot™s situational   awareness competencies directly affect his or her perceptions  and assessment of risk. The lower the degree of threat that  pilots associate with instability and environmental factors Š  the perception of which is directly informed by their situ -ational awareness Š the lower the significance that pilots will   place on the contributing factors and the less risky they will  perceive the situation to be. Table 6 shows this result, with  unstable approachŒrecall pilots reporting much lower assess -ments of the riskiness and unmanageability of their instabili -ties than go-aroundŒrecall pilots. 5.4.2.1  The Spreading Activation Effect of Situational Awareness  Competencies We have asserted that the inter-dependent nature of the facets  of situational awareness means that a decline in one facet will  produce a rapid deleterious effect on the others. This becomes  clear when we consider the data relevant to this ﬁspreading  activation effectﬂ of situational awareness facets. For example,  this cross-contamination effect is evident among the unstable  approach pilot groups, whose lower scores on their gut feel  for threats (Table 6), as well as on actually seeing the threats,  leave them vulnerable to minimizing both their assessment of  the potential threat of aircraft instability and their ability to   see the threat of instability as a risk to be managed correctly.  The natural outcome is that more unstable approach pilots are  unstable at SAH (Table 5). A corollary of these lower aware -ness scores is that unstable approach pilots also score lower   in their ability to leverage crew relationships to maximize  compliance and safety; Table 6 shows that unstable approach  pilots are more likely to minimize efforts to consider and/or  discuss with their crewmembers both instability factors (i.e.,  16 |flight path deviation, aircraft V REF + 20 kt, 2 sink rate and land -ing configuration) and environmental factors (i.e., turbulence,  contaminated runway and occupied runway). It is the culminating effect of the aforementioned reduced  awareness competencies that leaves the unstable approach  pilots vulnerable to adopting a mental model that minimizes  the risk of instability and reduces their attention to details.  As the results for ﬁknowing the instruments and equipmentﬂ  and ﬁknowing the proceduresﬂ indicate (i.e., functional and  hierarchical awareness, in Table 6), unstable approach pilots   are more tolerant of deviations from operational limits and  procedures and less compliant with requirements that they  perform all checklists and standard calls. Moreover, as these  pilots commit to continuing with an unstable approach, they  minimize what their professional experience could offer in  executing what the SOP states (in Table 6, note ﬁrelying on  experienceﬂ or critical awareness). In other words, when an  unstable approach pilot is not tuned into salient informa -tion from his or her experience bank, he increases the risk  profile of the operation and denies himself the opportunity to  correctly adjust or compensate for the operational threat (in  Table 6, ﬁadjusting to threatsﬂ or compensatory awareness).  The finding that unstable approach pilots more often than  go-around pilots report being unstable at SAH confirms this  missed opportunity to remain compliant (Table 5). In concert with the former pattern is the finding that  unstable approach pilots were more comfortable operating  on the margins of the safety envelope (for example, in Table   6, note the lower scores on ﬁknowing the limitsﬂ or task- empirical awareness), which translates to a greater tolerance  for risk that is seen to be manageable. (Also in Table 6, note  the assessment of the instability as risky/unmanageable.) If  a pilot is paying less attention to his situational awareness  competencies, he would likely also shut himself off from avail -able resources, such as by using interpersonal relationships to   protect operational safety and remain compliant (in Table 6,  note ﬁkeeping each other safeﬂ or relational awareness). There are a number of significant findings at the granu -lar level of this construct that tell a meaningful story. Most   notable among these is that unstable approach pilots are  relatively more likely than go-around pilots to feel crew pres -sure to land, to perceive a lack of crew support for a possible   go-around decision, to feel discomfort in being challenged and  in challenging others, and to feel inhibited about calling for a  go-around because of the authority structure in the cockpit. Also, go-around pilots are about four times more likely than  unstable approach pilots (56 percent vs. 13 percent) to report   recalling that an individual was prompting the crew to initiate  2 VREF  is reference landing speed a go-around. The evidence is clear that rather than leveraging  the crew relationships as a tool for safe decision making, crew  roles, expectations and communication had a suboptimal,  even deleterious, effect. Finally, compounding this risk profile  are the findings that unstable approach pilots score lower on  ﬁcompany support for safetyﬂ and that fewer than 50 percent  of unstable approachŒrecall pilots believed they would be  reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to land -ing while, at the same time, maintaining that their company™s   criteria for when to execute a go-around are not realistic   (Table 6). In the end, for the unstable approach pilots, there is  less buy-in to company SOPs, and an incentive structure that  ﬁencourages,ﬂ or is at least not seen to discourage, unstable  approaches that are continued to a landing. These results describe a situation that creates internal  conflict for the unstable approach pilots, at least in hindsight,  when they express regret for their decision to continue an  unstable approach to landing (Table 7). Specifically, compared  with go-around pilots, unstable approach pilots rated their   flight outcomes less positively, believed less often that they  had made the right decision, believed much more strongly  than go-around pilots that they should not have made the  decisions they did and, finally, agreed more strongly that they  had engaged in needless risk. 5.4.2.2  Interpretation of ‚Conflicting™ Results The results appear to imply a conflicting message from the   unstable approach pilot group. On one hand, unstable ap -proach pilots regret their decisions to continue an unstable   approach and land, knowing that they have taken a risk, and  yet, at the same time, they don™t believe that the company™s  criteria for a go-around are realistic (Table 6). The latter may  be, in part, a rationalization of their noncompliant decision,  and one that they carry forward into the next such unstable  approach situation. At the moment of decision, the potential  for noncompliant behavior based on these beliefs is very pres -ent, while the chance seems remote that pilots may anticipate  post-decision regret for not calling for a go-around Š and may  have that anticipation inhibit their tendency to continue the  unstable approach. Consider the psychosocial factors affecting unstable ap -proach pilots at the time they need to make an appropriate  decision on whether to go around: They have a lowered sense  of situational awareness across most facets, which has led  them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their   assessment of risk. Further, their decision-making process re -ceives little help from protective crew norms and processes;   and there is no real disincentive to fly unstable approaches,  17 |considering the expected company response to that decision.  These are the ingredients of a recipe for the ﬁnormalization of  devianceﬂ to contaminate this component of aviation safety  culture. Essentially, this term refers to the development of a   ﬁnew normalﬂ mode of operation, which is passively support -ed, tolerated and/or approved by its stakeholders (pilots),  owners (company management), and in some cases, regula -tors. Once entrenched within a given culture, this new mode™s   power and authority can considerably influence behavior,  as evidenced in the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle  tragedies (Vaughan). Supportive evidence from the results of  this study indicates that in their acceptance of the noncom -pliant normal, unstable approach pilots have surrendered   a level of situational awareness competency that directly  impacts accurate risk assessment and full compliance with   SOPs as published. In short, new norms, roles and incentives  have come to displace some of the influence that situational  awareness should have in proximity to risk assessment and  decision making. 5.4.3 Pilot Thresholds for Going Around Another area for discussion is the second experimental part  of the survey, which asked pilots to describe their risk toler -ance thresholds for various in-flight parameters, given a set   of flight and environmental conditions. We found that braking  action (good vs. poor) had a particularly large impact on a pi -lot™s perception of the degrees of instability that warrant call -ing for a go-around. On the whole, however, pilots™ thresholds  for calling for go-around varied as a function of both height  AGL and the instability parameter they were considering as a  reason for going around. For several of these instability fac -tors, the perceived threshold occurred well below 1,000 ft AGL  (Figures 1 to 3). In particular, pilots said that they should be  on profile at roughly 800 ft AGL, and that they could compen -sate for instabilities for V REF+  and sink rate later in the decent,  at around 500 ft AGL. In another project analysis, combined data from six North  American airlines (two international jet airlines, three  regional jet airlines and one regional turboprop airline) that  are studying this problem independently show 2,035 pilot  responses to the question: ﬁWhat is the lowest altitude you  believe a safe go-around could be executed from; with vari -able conditions?ﬂ (Figure 4, p. 18; Figure 5, p. 19; Figure 6, p.   20; Presage Group). The results can be broken out into four   groupings: lateral and vertical deviations, energy manage -ment, aircraft configuration and environmental conditions.   From the data, we can see significant altitude differences  between the configuration of the aircraft and energy man -agement, and how the more challenging environmental con - ditions affect flight crews™ outlooks about when a go-around  should be performed. Also of note is the lower altitude at  which flight crews feel comfortable performing a go-around  when all conditions are normal; this is not surprising, as we  Figure 1 GA Thresholds for Flight Path Deviation 0.000.50 1.001.501,00050020050Flight path deviation(dots)Altitude (feet above ground level)LFPDVFPDNorm lateral and verticalGA = go-around; LFPD = lateral ˝ight path deviation;   VFPD = vertical ˝ight path deviation Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation Figure 2 GA Thresholds for Velocity Deviation 0.002.004.006.008.0010 .0012.0014.0016.001,000 500 200 50Speed deviation (kt) Altitude (feet above ground level) VREF  +VREF  ˜Norm V REF  ˜Norm V REF  +GA = go-around; V REF = reference landing speed Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation Figure 3 GA Thresholds for Sink Rate Deviation 0200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 Sink rate deviation (fpm) Altitude (feet above ground level) Norm sink  1,000 500 200 500 GA = go-around Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation 18 |Figure 4 Pilot Response Scores to Question: What is the lowest altitude you believe a safe go-around could be executed  from?

The inherent risks associated with the 97 percent  of unstable approaches that continue unstable can only be  indirectly inferred from the present methodology, based on  pilot self-reports. This study mainly assessed the psychologi -cal characteristics and attributes,  in situ , of pilots who choose  to continue unstable approaches to landing versus those who  make decisions to go around. The study does not segregate  the various unstable approach scenarios into classes of envi -ronments presenting high or low objective risks. While it is   understood that not all unstable approaches carry the same  level of inherent risk, the 97 percent of unstable approaches   that are flown to completion include the highest-risk ap -proaches, and these can result in accidents. In the absence   of a definition of the objective level of risk associated with  a given approach, pilots have only one set of criteria, one  definition of the instabilities and environmental threats  that are expected to trigger a go-around choice.

Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation what he or she perceives as a safe and manageable level of  risk. This determination flows directly from his level and  type of situational awareness and the mental models of risk  he constructs based on that awareness. To the extent that a  pilot has lowered situational awareness Š whether caused  by acute aspects of the situation such as a high workload or  chronic aspects of the cultural environment such as lessened  acceptance of the company™s go-around policy guidance or  generally few challenges to cockpit command Š he will be  less sensitive to relevant situational awareness cues and   therefore be more likely to continue an unstable approach  irrespective of the inherent objective risks associated with   the approach. These inadequately informed mental models  of risk less accurately and sensitively represent the objective  levels of the present threat. As a result, they will not track re -ality and will tend to produce an over-occurrence of noncom -pliant decision making. 5.4.5 Complete Prescriptive Policies vs. Predominately  Prescriptive Policies Complete prescriptive go-around policies and SOPs lend them -selves to one set of criteria Š one definition of the instabilities  20 |Figure 6 Pilot Response Scores (Average) to Question:  What Is the Lowest Altitude You Believe A Safe   Go-Around Could Be Executed From?

A single set of criteria is often insufficient to  cover all eventualities, however. As Tony Kern, an aviator, psychologist and author of  several books on human behavior, has said, guidance is ef -fective when it is ﬁwell thought out and fair, written clearly,   explained thoroughly, commonly understood and voluntarily  complied with.ﬂ Too many rules lead to cynicism and noncompliance, and,  because not all situations can be anticipated, rules cannot be   developed to cover all possible developments; in these cases, the  human ability to adapt to changing situations is just as important  as the implementation of effective policies and procedures. ﬁWe need to reach a point where two types of professional  discipline become second-nature habits,ﬂ Kern said. ﬁThe first   is the  organizational discipline  to keep the [bad] rules to an  absolute minimum and enforce the [good] rules across the   board. The second is the  personal discipline  to comply [with  company policies].ﬂ Too often, he said, policies and procedures conflict with  cultural norms, and when that happens, ﬁanyone who studies   noncompliance knows that culture will nearly always trump  policy, at least in the long run.ﬂ (Kern) Not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent  risk, and based on the different objective environments from   approach to approach, there can be a conflict between these  and the singular prescriptive company go-around policy, as in -dicated by the pilots™ disagreement with company go-around   policy thresholds. Once a pilot is outside the prescriptive box  of go-around policy and has made the decision to continue the  approach, he is left to his individual risk assessment method,  whatever that may be, to determine his personal risk thresh -old, without guidance. Robust prescriptive policies that allow   for some guided, open analysis of risk and decision making  can offer a solution to these cases in which the objective envi -ronment and stated policies do not align well. For example, if a company™s go-around policy says that a  flight crew must go around in all cases if the aircraft has not   touched down within seven seconds of crossing the threshold,  the pilots likely would view the importance of that policy dif -ferently, depending on the conditions of the day. They would   likely be more in agreement with the policy for an approach   to a shorter runway that was contaminated and had a slight  tail wind than for an approach to a longer, dry runway with a  slight head wind. If the policy is written to allow some devia -tion from the seven-second requirement, under some guiding   principles, pilots will agree with the policy more often. In this  example of the short contaminated runway, the pre-descent  briefing should include a statement that there would be no  modification of the seven-second rule, whereas in the case of  the dry, long runway, the briefing may include an allowance to   increase that timeframe to 10 seconds. It is important to em -phasize that these allowances should follow a guided process   laid out by the company, and that the policies remain predomi -nately prescriptive. In this example, guiding principles may be   that all crewmembers agree in advance of the modification,  and that the landing distance available exceeds the landing  distance required by a predetermined percentage. 21 |By allowing some guided decision making, pilots will be more  likely to trust and voluntarily comply with written policies, in  part because those policies will address the highly variable  environments in which pilots work and also because the pilots  will recognize that their expertise and real-time knowledge are  being used in the risk-assessment process. An increased agree -ment on policy leads to increased buy-in and to the normalization   of compliance. 5.4.6 Stable Approach Criteria, Gates, Callouts and Decision Points It is also worth discussing the relationship between the   stable approach criteria, the SAH targets, gates, safe landing  guidelines and decision points. As the decision to go around  remains possible up until the point of thrust-reverser deploy -ment and go-around policies usually indicate that a go-around   should be initiated any time an aircraft becomes unstable  below the SAH, then it follows that the decision point to go  around defines the beginning of a zone in which a go-around  is mandatory if the approach is unstable; thrust reverser  deployment defines the end of that zone. Most SOP callouts,   however, channel flight crews to specific decision points to  determine if they are in a state in which it is safe to continue  the approach; these points are before thrust-reverser deploy -ment. These SOP callout points are usually linked with SAHs,   leaving no formal stable callouts for an extended period of  time when a go-around is viable. Active calls (a selection of  calls that are mandatory for all varying objective conditions)  force communication between pilots. Passive, or conditional  calls, on the other hand, are only communicated if stimulated   by a condition. The weakness in the passive call process is  that, if a call is not made, it could be for reasons other than  the required objective condition being present. For example,  if a crewmember did not see the condition, a call would not be  made; in addition, a crewmember might choose not to make a  call for varying reasons, such as a subjective interpretation of  the condition or fear of the cockpit authority structure. Active  calls are always made, and, as stated, they force communica -tion; their absence indicates another problem, such as pilot  incapacitation. Many responsive callouts by the pilot flying at SAH or  minimum approach height suggest what will happen, what  they are going to do Š for example ﬁLanding.ﬂ Suggestive  calls like this, to a degree, influence the decision to land and  close the window for the decision to go around, even though a  go-around may be required if the flight becomes unstable very  late in the approach or landing. Repeated and escalated calls allow a condition to remain  alive in the conscious mind of the pilot; on the other hand,   a single callout Š for example at SAH Š raises situational  awareness about the condition at that moment. As situational  awareness is dynamic, it can change quickly, improving or   worsening, and callouts that are designed to continue as long   as the condition exists help to maintain awareness of that  condition; escalation of the calls can heighten awareness. Take  the example of callouts from Enhanced Ground Proximity  Warning Systems (EGPWS) and other terrain awareness and  warning systems (TAWS). The system alerts the flight crew  to a pending condition and continues with callouts until the  condition is no longer present. The same effect can be accom -plished in unstable approach callouts by both crewmembers   and automated systems. As the onset of approach instabilities can occur at any time,  even late in the landing phase (Burin, Keys to a Safe Arrival),   the window for a go-around decision follows; that is, the deci -sion is not made at a defined point at the SAH. The decision   points for a go-around are separate and distinct from the  stable approach window, and as such, procedure designers  can separate the two to maximize go-around decision making. In reviewing the FSF ALAR Task Force ﬁRecommended  Elements of a Stabilized Approachﬂ (Flight Safety Foundation   ALAR Task Force), we discover a somewhat conflicting mes -sage. It states that approaches in instrument meteorological   conditions (IMC) must be stabilized before reaching 1,000 ft  AGL. (In visual meteorological conditions [VMC], they must  be stabilized before 500 ft AGL in precision, nonprecision and  visual approaches alike). On the other hand, the document  indicates that descent below 500 ft is acceptable in maneuver -ing for a circling approach, and specifies that ﬁwings should be   level on final when the aircraft reaches 300 ft above airport   elevation.ﬂ In other words, on a precision guided approach, the  documented guidance is that the aircraft must be stable on  final no later than 500 feet AGL in VMC, and on a circling non- guided approach, the aircraft must be stable on final no later  than 300 feet AGL. It is not difficult for a pilot to conclude that,  if it is acceptable and safe to fly off a final approach profile  until 300 ft AGL on a non-instrument approach, then it is also  safe to fly an instrument-guided approach to 300 ft off profile,  although that is, by definition, unstable. 5.4.6.1  Objective Monitoring/Feedback Objective monitoring/feedback is that which does not require   an individual to interpret information based on his or her ex -perience or opinion; it is usually factual information. Objective   feedback in the cockpit minimizes the need for interpretation  and can lead to more consistent and faster decision making.  Additionally, stating a fact Š instead of interpreting informa -tion, making a judgment or forming an opinion Š helps mini -mize the effect of a steep authority gradient in the cockpit,  such as may exist when a low-time first officer is paired with  a high-time captain. An example of objective feedback is that  22 |given by an automated system such as EGPWS. In this case,  there is little subjective analysis done by the pilot when re -sponding to automated callouts, and the response can be quick   and predictable. This is, in part, why an automated energy  management/unstable approach monitoring and alerting sys -tem can be very effective in improving go-around compliance.   Another example of the use of objective feedback is the use of  radio altimeter automatic callouts rather than interpreting  radio altimeter readout information. Readouts can fluctuate  due to terrain variances, and must be observed and evaluated.   Callouts, on the other hand, are only heard; in the absence of  an automated energy management system, after pilots cross  the threshold, they usually subjectively interpret, or sense,  how much runway has passed by, or how much remains. From  this, they decide whether to conduct a go-around. If the pilot  monitoring (PM) times the threshold crossing and then makes  a procedural call at the point where touchdown should occur  or a go-around should begin, this call constitutes objective  feedback to the pilot flying (PF) and makes clear that some -thing Š either touchdown or a go-around Š should occur (or  should have occurred, driven by policy and SOPs). Minimizing subjectivity in go-around decision-making pro -cedures is an objective that procedural designers should make  every effort to achieve. 5.5 Analysis: Management Decision Making 5.5.1 Overview of Results In Table 8, we present data for managers™ self-reports of their   awareness of, and, if possible, their specific estimates of, both  the industry™s and their own companies™ rates of compliance  with unstable approachŒgo-around policy. When asked whether they knew what the industry-wide  compliance rate was, only 32 percent of managers said that  they did. Of those who claimed awareness, however, fewer  were willing to estimate a rate. Thirty-four managers (27  percent of the 128 participating) offered an estimated rate,  which averaged 20 percent compliance (seven times the true   rate) and was highly variable (range: 1 percent to 80 percent;  standard deviation: 24 percent). Only one in seven managers  (16 percent) reported a rate that was considered ﬁaccurateﬂ  (within 10 percent of the actual 3 percent industry-wide  rate). The perception of industry-wide rates may not be the  central concern of managers working to police their own  noncompliance with unstable approachŒgo-around policy, but  this general lack of awareness and accuracy in estimating the  true rate, even among those claiming awareness, cannot be   overstated. When asked whether they knew what their own company™s  compliance rate was, 45 percent of managers said that they  did, although only 42 percent offered an estimate of that rate.  Thus, a majority of managers are largely unaware of unstable  approachŒgo-around compliance and noncompliance rates,  even within their own companies. Of the 54 managers who  offered estimates, the mean rate was 34 percent compliance,  again with a large range (0 to 100 percent) and standard de -viation (35 percent). These managers are estimating compli -ance rates at their companies that are, on average, more than  50 percent above the industry average as they perceive it (20  percent). If their estimates were accurate, they would indicate  that the managers™ companies were outperforming the indus -try as a whole by more than tenfold (34 percent vs. 3 percent).  What is most striking is the tremendous degree of variability  in the data, revealing that there is very little common basis of  perception, even among those claiming knowledge of the rates  at their own airlines. In our view, it is highly unlikely that this  is an objective estimate. For perceptions to have truly tracked  with reality, these data would mean that companies are ex -hibiting the full range of compliance from zero to 100 percent.   It is hard to imagine that this is the case, and hard to imagine   how this could result in an industry-wide average that hovers  at 3 percent year after year.

Of the 116 managers at those compa -nies, 54 (47 percent) reported on their rate of compliance  as indicated by their data. These 54 managers are not the  same 54 who reported on their companies™ flight operations  compliance rates in answer to the prior question. One in eight  managers (12 percent) reported FDAŒbased compliance rates  broadly in line with the industry average (i.e., less than 10  percent). At the opposite end of the spectrum, 21 percent re -ported rates above 50 percent. The mean rate was 44 percent,  again with a wide range and variability (zero to 100 percent,  with standard deviation of 37 percent). That such a spread of  compliance rates is reported by this sample is surprising; we  believe it reflects not only a general lack of awareness among  managers of the rates of compliance with their own policies  (as strongly indicated by the incidence of non-reporting) but  perhaps also specific errors within their knowledge, although  objective data are available. This assertion can only be made,  however, by again assuming that compliance rates exceeding   50 percent are rare in the industry; we cannot rule this out  because although we have access to self-reported data, we  lack objective verification of company compliance rates. If the  self-reported rates are accurate, it suggests that our sample is  drawn from an unusually compliant subsample of companies.  In that light, the lack of awareness effects across the manager  study suggests that industry-wide awareness could be less  than estimated. We begin with some overall observations about the data  in Table 8. First, on each of the three questions, the norma -tive response is to not know, and only a minority of manag -ers claim to know, or report, a rate of compliance. Second,   as expected, managers claim, and report, compliance rates  for their own companies more frequently than they do for  the industry as a whole, probably because they are less  familiar with   industry-wide data. Third, their perception of  the industry-wide compliance is out of line with reality, six   times greater than the actual 3 percent rate of compliance.   Fourth, managers tell us as an aggregate sample that they  believe their companies are outperforming the industry™s rate  of compliance by 50 to 100 percent, on average; this is the  equivalent of a compliance rate at least 10 times greater than  the industry™s as a whole. Finally, if we assume that these com -panies have a more realistic unstable approachŒgo-around   policy compliance rate below 10 percent (i.e., a rate span still  up to three times better than the current industry norm), this  would mean that only about one in seven managers (12 to 17   percent) in the survey reported an accurate rate for their own  companies, whether their reporting was based on a personal  estimate or on their FDA data. If we give them more ﬁcompli -ance credit,ﬂ and allow that their companies actually achieved  rates upward of 50 percent, then a high accuracy of managers™   rates of report is still shared by fewer than one-third of the  sample: Seven in 10 simply do not know their own rates, or if  they do know, they over-report their compliance rates by more  than 50 percent. These kinds of perceptual errors are likely  to produce overconfidence and complacency about mangers™  unstable approachŒgo-around policy compliance. 5.5.2 Manager Situational Awareness Profile 5.5.2.1  Manager Perceptual Measures of Situational Awareness Managers completed 17 questions to assess their attitudes,  beliefs and behaviors concerning their company™s go-around  rates and unstable approachŒgo-around policies. The results  are in Table 9 (p. 24). First, the responses were subjected to an empirical factor  analysis to determine how they merged in managers™ minds  and to provide simpler summary categories for presentation  and discussion. Three of the four factors to emerge had more  than one associated question. One factor (Factor 4) was a  single-question assessment of behavior, namely, whether the   respondent debriefed flight crew who had violated the com -pany™s unstable approachŒgo-around policy. Factor 1™s theme was the perceived support that the respon -dents received from their companies in understanding and   managing go-around rates. The six questions this factor com -prised were averaged and called ﬁperceived support.ﬂ Factor 2   comprised questions assessing the degree to which managers  thought that their companies™ unstable approachŒgo-around  policies and procedures and their associated operational   definitions were effective, clear and appropriate. Responses to  five questions were averaged to create an index of ﬁperceived  effectiveness.ﬂ Finally, Factor 3 was an expression of manag -ers™ concerns about and sense of urgency surrounding their   companies™ go-around rates. It was formulated by averaging  responses to the five questions shown in Table 9, and named  ﬁperceived threat.ﬂ In addition to the four factors, we present overall measures  recorded by managers of their satisfaction with, and the per -ceived effectiveness of, their companies™ go-around policies  and procedures, as they relate to unstable approaches. The first thing to notice in Table 9 about these manager per -ceptions is the absolute levels of the means on the underlying  six-point scale. (This six-point scale did not offer a midpoint,  but instead presented the opportunity to report slight, moder -ate or strong agreement or disagreement with each statement   or assertion; the midscale is 3.5 on this 1 to 6 Likert scale.

Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation 25 |indexes and the underlying questions reveals that managers  perceive a moderate degree of effectiveness of their policies  and procedures and slightly less than a moderate level of sup -port from their organizations in managing their go-around   rates. The overall measure of perceived effectiveness was  slightly weaker than the index score of effectiveness; overall  satisfaction with compliance rates associated with their flight  operation™s go-around policies, while slightly lower, was still  on the positive side of the scale. In concert with this pattern Š  perhaps  because  of these perceptions and judgments Š man -agers slightly disagreed overall (perceived threat) that there  was a cause for concern or a need for action to improve their  go-around rates. Taken together, these absolute scores indicate that manag -ers are not completely happy with their companies™ perfor -mance on go-around policy and procedures, but their concerns   are not great enough, seemingly, to stimulate greater aware -ness or action. As an aside, a regression analysis of the drivers of the ﬁover -all effectivenessﬂ and ﬁoverall satisfactionﬂ scores revealed  that overall effectiveness is perceived in proportion to scores  on the Perceived Effectiveness Index, and to a lesser degree,  the lack of urgency and concern is expressed by scores on the  Perceived Threat Index. In complementary fashion, over -all satisfaction was driven first by lower perceived threat   scores and secondarily by higher perceptions reflected in the  Perceived Effectiveness Index. These meaningful, differential  patterns were observed, although the overall measures of   satisfaction and effectiveness were high. Finally, managers, on average, narrowly agreed that they ﬁde -brief all flight crews who have broken our company™s policies on  operational procedures for go-around.ﬂ Taken at its face, 37 per -cent disagree that all flight crews are debriefed, a high absolute   number of managers who admit to less than complete debriefing  protocols. However, while this may seem like a high percentage,  the fact that the statement was phrased as ﬁI debriefﬂ as opposed  to ﬁour company debriefsﬂ may account for the response. To examine the relationships between positive perceptions  of organizational support, compliance effectiveness, satisfac -tion and low concern with their go-around rates, we studied  responses from only those managers who had reported on  their companies™ FDA-sourced go-around compliance rates  Š that is, of all those claiming knowledge of this informa -tion. We divided them into managers whose reports were   generally close to the industry average of 3 percent, accept -ing anyone who reported a rate of less than 10 percent into a  group we labeled ﬁcorrectﬂ (for reporting what looked like a  reasonably accurate rate, compared with the industry base  rate). All other managers reported compliance rates from 10  to 100 percent and were placed in a comparison group labeled  ﬁincorrectﬂ (for reporting a compliance rate not likely to be  accurate). The results show that stating an ﬁincorrectﬂ rate of compli -ance is associated, at significant statistical levels, with higher  scores on two of the five questions on the second factor of per -ceived effectiveness, the Effectiveness Index as a whole, and   the overall, single measure of effectiveness (overall effective -ness). It is also correlated with lower scores on the Perceived   Threat Index and four of its five component questions. While  this pattern may seem obvious in hindsight, it makes the point   that, independent of the level of support perceived for manag -ing a company™s go-around rates (there were no differences on   the Perceived Support Index), the perception of the company™s  policies as effective and the threat as low may flow from a  basic lack of realistic knowledge or appraisal of the go-around  compliance rates. If this causal effect is true Š that is, posi -tive perceptions lead to low perceived threat Š then what is   clearly indicated by these data is the need for consciousness- raising about the industry norm of massive noncompliance,   and dissemination of the managers™ own companies™ data  identifying their internal rates of unstable approachŒgo- around policy compliance and noncompliance. 5.5.3 Segmentation Analysis To determine whether the sample included types of manag -ers whose views of their company™s go-around compliance  rate and performance were consistent with each other and  also different from other identified groups, we conducted a  traditional cluster analysis on this sample of managers (i.e.,  non-hierarchical, agglomerative K-means cluster analysis,  based on Euclidean distances). Due to the small sample size,  we generated just two groups to compare, and based the  mathematics of this segmentation on a variety of responses  given in the survey. This ﬁbasis of segmentationﬂ consisted of   the 17 perception questions and the two overall measures of  effectiveness and satisfaction Š all the measures presented in  Table 9. Not surprisingly, the resulting groups consisted of one  whose members perceived a high risk in their go-around  compliance rates (the ﬁHigh Risk Perceiversﬂ Group) and a  second group whose members had a more moderate view  (the ﬁLow Risk Perceiversﬂ Group). The 35 percent of manag -ers who perceived high risk differed from the 65 percent of  low-risk perceivers on almost all measures in the survey, and  powerfully so, in both the statistical sense and the magnitude  sense (the degree of statistical difference). Table 9 shows  that on 17 of 19 measures, and on all three indexes, the High  Risk Perceiver Group showed a pattern of higher concern and  perceived threat, lower satisfaction with their companies™  go-around compliance, lower perceived policy and compliance  26 |Table 10 Presage Situational Awareness Construct Results for Managers Situational Awareness Indices Overall  Sample n=128Means 1Report of FDA  Compliance Rate Segmentation 0Œ<10% ﬁCorrectﬂ n=14Means 110Œ100% ﬁIncorrectﬂ n=39Means 1High Risk  Perceivers n=44 (35%)Means 1Low Risk  Perceivers n=82 (65%)Means 1Functional Awareness Index (knowing the performance metrics) 3.324.073.42**3.723.10Hierarchical Awareness Index (knowing the procedures) 1.711.691.742.191.46Task-Empirical Awareness Index (knowing the limits) 2.162.672.15*2.901.77Critical Awareness Index (relying on experience) 2.953.963.01*3.842.41A˜ective Awareness Index (having a gut feel for threats) 3.004.063.05*4.042.38Anticipatory Awareness Index (seeing the threats) 3.084.113.14*4.192.42Compensatory Awareness Index (adjusting to threats) 3.023.453.01**3.592.71Relational Awareness Index (keeping each other safe) 2.342.542.362.902.03Environmental Awareness Index (corporate support for safety) 2.282.662.22*2.921.93FDA = ˝ight data analysis; GA = go-around; n = number; UA = unstabilized approach Notes:  1.

They also reported lower  rates of debriefing their noncompliant flight crews. When we profiled these two groups on other measures  collected in the study, we found interesting correlated ef -fects. For example, high risk perceiver types tended to see   their company compliance rates as slightly underperform -ing, relative to (perceived) industry norms, whereas low   risk perceiver types reported that their companies were  definitely outperforming the industry compliance rate. High   risk types were more likely to claim that prior to the study,  they had been aware of the industry rate and of their own  company flight operations™ rate of compliance. Interestingly,  those in the High Risk Perceiver Group were more likely to  report being in roles in which they had less power to effect  change, more often saying they were able only to offer recom -mendations. Added to the fact that members of the High Risk   Perceiver Group were three times less likely than those in  the Low Risk Perceiver Group to say their compliance rates   were between 50 and 100 percent Š a suspect number Š and  more than four times as likely to say that their FDA showed  their rate was between zero and 9 percent Š a number more  in line with industry norms Š a picture emerges of a group  whose members are more realistic and appropriately anxious  and concerned about their companies™ low rates of go-around  compliance, but who perhaps have little voice or power within  the company to change policy or procedures (which they see  as more likely to be unrealistic) or to offer a new definition of  what should constitute a stable approach (which they see as  overly narrow). How did these managers score on the Presage indices  of situational awareness? This situation presents a clear   instance of violation, via near-complete noncompliance, of  most airlines™ policies and procedures surrounding unstable  approachŒ  go-around performance rates and their manage -ment. As such, our metrics are likely to show low absolute  scores, on a scale of 1 to 6, with 6 corresponding to high safety  awareness. The first column of Table 10, which displays these  scores for the overall sample, shows this to be the case; in no  case does the absolute score on any of our awareness metrics   exceed the midscale of 3.5. Safety awareness is low in all of  the awareness areas assessed by our system. 27 |Because we know in this instance that unstable approachŒ go-around noncompliance is a major problem for the industry,  our measures of situational awareness are scored higher  when this problem is recognized to be present. In the ap -proach to scoring shown in Table 10, all measures are scored   such that higher numbers indicate a greater degree of realistic  threat awareness and appraisal. As a result, higher situational  awareness on our measures is associated with seeing the cur -rent threat to be real (high anticipatory awareness) and the   procedural measures used to compensate for it to be inad -equate (poorly adjusting to the threat). Managers with higher  situational awareness see their current procedures as unre -alistic and the definitions of instability as too narrow (high   scores on knowing the procedures and knowing the limits).  Their experience (critical awareness: high reliance on experi -ence) tells them there is a problem, and they feel more anxious   and eager to take action against this safety threat (higher gut  feeling for threats). However, because a new plan is needed  in the face of a general lack of appreciation of the threat to   compliance in their organizations, higher awareness is also  associated with a perception that their companies have little  will to change, and are generally complacent about the SOPs  in place to manage the threat (low relational and corporate  support for safety). As a result, those with higher awareness  also feel less support from Š and a higher level of discomfort  in approaching Š senior management to broach the issue. With this understanding of our scoring methods in mind,  we examined the scores of the two groups Š the managers   who reported a compliance rate based on their FDA that was  ﬁcorrectﬂ (less than 10 percent) versus those who overesti -mated the compliance rate (10 percent or more). We hypoth - esized that a more accurate awareness of the true, low rate of  compliance would be associated with a heightened sense of  awareness, perceived threat and anxiety, the felt need to com -pensate, etc. Š all aspects of the situational awareness model.   We predicted, therefore, that managers who were aware of  the actual low rate of compliance with unstable approachŒgo-  around policies at their airlines would receive higher scores  on all nine of our metrics than their colleagues who were  unaware, even if the magnitude of these scores was still low in  absolute terms when compared to the scale range. In Table 10, it can be seen that on seven of our nine metrics  of situational awareness, the hypothesis that the go-around  respondents would report greater situational awareness was  supported at a level of statistical reliability of 90 percent or  better; that is, if this experiment were repeated 20 times, we   would observe the same differences in 18 of the replications.  Only on ﬁKnowing the proceduresﬂ and ﬁKeeping each other  safeﬂ were the levels of awareness similar for the two groups,  albeit at low absolute levels. In summary, those aware of the  low compliance rates at their companies scored at or above  the midscale on five of our metrics (Functional, Critical, Affec -tive, Anticipatory and Compensatory). If a minimum midscale   threshold of situational awareness across a majority of our  measures was enough to trigger some action, the individuals  in this group were close to reaching such a trigger point. How -ever, note that this group constituted just 11 percent (14 of   128) of our sample Š a small minority coming to full aware -ness of the problem. Table 10 also shows results derived from cluster analysis  on the Presage metrics for the two groups Š those perceiving  relatively high risk in their companies™ unstable   approachŒgo- around policies and rates (35 percent of sample) and those   not generally perceiving such risks (65 percent). (It will be  recalled these groups were designed for all managers in  the sample, irrespective of whether they claimed to know,  or ventured to report, what their company compliance rate  actually was, according to FDA or otherwise). In this case, all  nine awareness factors are statistically reliably different, with   five means above the midscale for the high-threat perception  group. These results are more encouraging in terms of ﬁsiz -ingﬂ the complement of managers perhaps ready to act in this   important area of noncompliance, as about one-third of the  sample shows signs of having reached a threshold of aware -ness that will trigger activity to manage this issue more safely   in the near future. As a demonstration of the effect that improved awareness  in one area can have on overall situational awareness, we   compared the situational awareness scores of all managers  (Figure 7, p. 28) with the scores of the group whose members  were aware of their internal company go-around compliance  rates (Figure 8, p. 28). Figure 8 shows the incremental benefit  that awareness in one area can have across eight of the nine  constructs. Finally, it is relevant to discuss the industry™s approach  to monitoring unstable approach flight data. As many flight  data monitoring programs are set to report only when more   than one stable approach criterion is exceeded, and in some  programs, to report only a low level alert until three or  more criteria are exceeded, we see an indication from those  responsible for the design of these programs that there is an  acknowledged variability in the risk of unstable approaches,  and, more importantly, there is an indication of a discon -nect between the level of management™s concern for low risk   unstable approaches and the policy guidance for flight crews  on those same approaches, which is to execute a go-around   when one or more criteria are exceeded. From the perspec -tive of the flight crews, why should they be concerned about   the risk of this level of unstable approaches if management is  not concerned enough to want to be told about them or act on  28 |Figure 8 Situational Awareness of Managers  Who Knew Company Compliance Rules 123456Gut feel for threats Relying on experience Seeing the threats Knowing the limits Coporate support for safety Knowing the performance metrics Adjusting to threats Keeping each other safe Knowing the procedures Additional bene˜t Base score Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation them? This is consistent with the results of both the pilot and  management psychological studies. 5.5.4 Industry Sensing The conversation about reducing the risk of ALAs often drifts   toward how to eliminate unstable approaches, even though  the discussion begins with a focus on rates of compliance with  go-around policies. It is clear that there is a larger discom -fort with the existence of unstable approaches, despite the   fact that the industry has reduced unstable approaches to 3  percent or less. In an industry with such variable objective  environments, one must ask ﬁWhat is the lowest attainable  unstable approach rate?ﬂ It makes sense that an industry with  almost nonexistent compliance with go-around policies would   be concerned about the small number of unstable approaches  that occur. If we turn the tables and consider for a moment  an industry with a high rate of go-around policy compliance,  would there be as much concern about unstable approaches?  And is the focus on eliminating unstable approaches the right   strategy in reducing ALAs? In Flight Safety Foundation™s 16- year study of runway excursions, conducted in 2010 (Tarrel),   we see that 53 percent of the landing excursions were clas -sified as veer-offs, and of these, 66 percent followed a stable   approach that became unstable during the landing phase.  Only 37 percent of the landing excursions followed unstable  approaches. Overruns accounted for the other 47 percent of  landing excursions; 37 percent of overruns followed stable  approaches, and 63 percent followed unstable approaches.  In total, 52 percent of landing runway excursions followed  stable approaches, and an almost-equal number Š 48 per -cent Š followed unstable approaches. A separate analysis  by Boeing of runway overrun excursions from 2003 to 2010  found that 68 percent followed stable approaches. (Jenkins  and Aaron). Drawing from this, a concentrated effort to reduce  Figure 7 Overall Manager Situational Awareness Scores 123456Gut feel for threats Relying on experience Seeing the threats Knowing the limits Coporate support for safety Knowing the performance metrics Adjusting to threats Keeping each other safe Knowing the procedures Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation 29 |the number of unstable approaches that become unstable in  the approach phase will address less than half of all landing  excursions. On the other hand, a reliable go-around decision- making operation has the potential to affect most landing ex -cursions Š those occurring after flights that become unstable   during the approach or landing phase. Clearly, a strategy to  continue improving the stable approach rate in addition to  improving the go-around compliance rate is the most com -plete strategy. The point of this discussion is to illustrate that   the industry™s tendency to focus only on eliminating unstable   approaches will not address a large portion of ALAs, and that  improving the go-around compliance rate holds the greater  risk-reduction potential. In 2009, an FSF runway safety initiative determined that a  gap existed in  ALAR Tool Kit  risk reduction tools, which did not  address the landing phase itself. The Foundation then developed  Safe Landing Guidelines  (Burin, Keys to a Safe Arrival), which are  intended to be used by aircraft operators to enhance existing  SOPs. Throughout this project, and through industry confer -ences and meetings, it was apparent that these guidelines were  not well known or commonly documented in company manuals.  These findings were not part of the data collection surveys. 5.6 Findings: Go-Around Decision Making The following are decision-making findings (DM) drawn from   analysis.  DMP  denotes decision-making pilot findings, and  DMM  denotes decision-making management findings. DMP Finding 1.  The unstable approach pilot group™s gut feeling  for threats Š the ﬁseat of the pantsﬂ experience characterized  by an emotional, sensory experience that triggers further cogni -tive analysis Š is lower than it is for the go-around pilot group. DMP Finding 2.  The unstable approach pilot group™s ability to see  and/or monitor real and potential threats as they change over   time and space is lower than that of the go-around pilot group. DMP Finding 3.  The unstable approach pilot group is more likely  than the go-around pilot group to minimize efforts to discuss   instability and environmental factors with other crewmembers,   and to shut themselves off from available resources. DMP Finding 4.  Unstable approach pilots are more tolerant than  go-around pilots of deviations from operational limits and   procedures. DMP Finding 5.  Unstable approach pilots are less compliant than  go-around pilots with performing all checklist items and accu - rately completing standard calls. DMP Finding 6.  Unstable approach pilots minimize what their pro -fessional experience, or critical awareness, could offer in terms of   executing known policies, compared with go-around pilots. DMP Finding 7.  Unstable approach pilots are more comfortable  than go-around pilots with operating on the margins of safety,   which translates into a greater tolerance of risk. DMP Finding 8.  Unstable approach pilots are more likely than  go-around pilots to feel pressure to land or perceive a lack of   support for a decision to go around. DMP Finding 9.  Unstable approach pilots are more likely than  go-around pilots to feel discomfort in being challenged or chal -lenging others.DMP Finding 10.  Unstable approach pilots are likely to feel in -hibited about calling for a go-around in situations with a strong   cockpit authority gradient. DMP Finding 11.  Go-around pilots indicated Š four times more  often than unstable approach pilots Š that another crewmem - ber was prompting the crew to initiate a go-around. DMP Finding 12.  Unstable approach pilots are less likely than  go-around pilots to feel support for safety from their companies,   and said they were less likely to be reprimanded for continuing  an unstable approach to landing and more likely to believe that  the incentive structure of their company does not discourage  unstable approaches to landing. DMP Finding 13.  Unstable approach pilots believe that their com -pany™s criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic. DMP Finding 14.  Unstable approach pilots, in hindsight, feel  regret about continuing an unstable approach more strongly  than go-around pilots regret going around, and feel less positive  about the outcomes of their decisions. DMP Finding 15.  Unstable approach pilots have a lower sense  of situational awareness across most facets, which leads them  to minimize the importance of objective threats in their risk  assessments.DMP Finding 16.  Pilot norms and processes for continuing  unstable approaches provide little foundation for compliant  go-around decision making (i.e., the ﬁnormalﬂ action is to  not go around when unstable). DMP Finding 17.  Norms, roles and incentives have displaced  some influence that good situational awareness should have in  risk assessment and decision making.DMP Finding 18.  Pilots who believe that their company™s criteria  for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe, on a whole,   that the threshold for the aircraft to be on profile and in proper  configuration is below 1,000 ft Š closer to 650 to 800 ft AGL. DMP Finding 19.  Pilots who believe that their company™s criteria  for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe, on a  whole, that they can compensate for energy management  30 |instabilities until the aircraft descends to 500 ft AGL, and under  certain conditions, below 500 ft. DMM Finding 1.  At the managerial level, there are indications of  general disengagement with the topic of go-around policy and  procedures. DMM Finding 2.  Among managers, there is a general lack  of awareness of industry-wide rates of go-around policy   compliance.DMM Finding 3.  Among managers, there is a general lack of  awareness of their own company rates of go-around policy   compliance.DMM Finding 4.  Among managers who have objective go-around  noncompliance rate data, such as flight data, understanding of   the compliance rate is likely inaccurate. DMM Finding 5.  Managers who claim to know the company go- around compliance rate are likely to overstate the compliance   rate by over 50 percent. These perceptual errors are likely to  produce overconfidence about go-around compliance. DMM Finding 6.  Managers perceive a moderate degree of effec -tiveness of their policies and procedures. DMM Finding 7.  Managers perceive less than a moderate level of  support within their company for managing go-around compli -ance rates. DMM Finding 8.  Managers slightly disagree overall that there is  concern about, or a need for, action to improve their go-around   compliance rates. DMM Finding 9.  The managers with better understanding of  go-around compliance rates for both the industry and their   own companies, the High Risk Perceiver Group, were more  realistic and concerned about their companies™ low go-around  compliance but perhaps have little voice or authority within the  company to change policy or procedures. DMM Finding 10.  Managers who scored higher on the situational  awareness measure associated with seeing the current threat  as real (anticipatory awareness) also scored lower in relative  terms on the measure used to compensate correctly for the risk  (compensatory awareness), suggesting the presence of a ﬁlearned  helplessnessﬂ with respect to effectively managing this risk. DMM Finding 11.  Managers with higher situational awareness  scores see their current procedures as being unrealistic and  definitions of instabilities as being too narrow. DMM Finding 12.  Managers with higher situational awareness  scores had the perception that their companies have little will to   change and are generally complacent about SOPs for managing  go-around compliance. DMM Finding 13.  Managers with higher awareness of their  companies™ go-around compliance rates also feel less support  from senior managers and a higher level of discomfort with ap -proaching them about the issue. DMM Finding 14.  Managers who were aware of low go-around  compliance rates in their companies scored at or above the   midscale on functional, critical, affective, anticipatory and  compensatory situational awareness metrics. This is a minority  consisting of 11 percent of respondents. DMM Finding 15.  The industry™s tendency is to lean toward the  single focus of improving the unstable approach rate as the   best way to prevent ALAs, even though empirical data indicate  otherwise.DMM Finding 16.  Safe Landing Guidelines , published by Flight  Safety Foundation to address an identified gap in the  ALAR Tool  Kit  risk reduction tools, is not well known by operators and not  documented in operations manuals. 5.7 Strategies for Corrective Action: Go-Around  Decision Making We conclude that there are three high-level categories that can  be defined in achieving an effective policy from a psychologi -cal perspective: Ł The policy should make sense operationally Š for most  environmental conditions encountered Š for the people  executing the policy (flight crews) and those managing  the policy (flight operations management), and should be  acceptable to those externally effected by the application of   the policy (air traffic controllers). Ł The policy must be managed effectively by the organiza - tion™s management personnel. This is important not only  because of the organization™s need to achieve objectives set  out by senior management but also because those execut -ing the policy (flight crews) need to see and understand  that the policy is being managed (i.e., management over -sight of the policy is apparent). Ł Awareness of the policy guidance and the risks associated  with not executing the policy must be high for both flight  crews and management. The following is a list of recommended higher-level decision- making strategies to mitigate go-around noncompliance. DM Strategy 1.  Ensure the policy makes sense operationally. a. Update the stable approach definition and SAH to  maximize their relevance to flight crews and their  manageability. 31 |b. Separate the stable approach definition and criteria from  decision-making criteria and decision-making points to  improve awareness that these are two distinct aspects of  go-around policies, and that decision making continues  beyond the approach phase. This does not imply that  they cannot meet at points throughout the approach and  landing; it is intended for the SOP and communication  designers to separate the psychological attachment of  these two aspects. DM Strategy 2.  Manage the policy effectively. a. Operators set specific compliance rate targets (key perfor -mance indicators) and establish initiatives to achieve them. b. Authorities amend industry and regulatory audit pro -grams to include standards and recommended practices  that address go-around noncompliance. DM Strategy 3.  Increase awareness. a. Increase awareness of go-around noncompliance and  risks associated with continuing to land when unstable,   and awareness of the significant impact that noncompli -ance has on ALAs, among:i. Operator management; ii. Flight crews; iii. Industry and pilot associations;iv.  Regulators; and, v. Manufacturers. b. Enhance situational awareness (psychosocial awareness)   to heighten flight crews™ awareness throughout the ap -proach (SAH and beyond), and landing through: i. Policy and procedural enhancements; and, ii. Communication improvements. c. Minimize the subjectivity of go-around decision making   for the decision maker (e.g., PF or captain, as per com -pany policy) to mitigate those components of situational  awareness that compromise the pilot™s risk assessment   and decision-making ability, for example, by installing  stable approach monitoring systems. 5.8 Recommendations: Go-Around Decision Making The following are decision-making recommendations for  corrective action to mitigate go-around noncompliance and  go-around execution risks. Each recommendation supports a  previously identified higher-level strategy. DM Recommendation 1.  Manufacturers should continue develop -ment of Š and operators should install Š stable approach and  energy management monitoring and alerting systems. DM Recommendation 2.  Operators should understand their own  respective go-around compliance rates. DM Recommendation 3.  Operators should establish internal go- around compliance rate measures, targets and goals. DM Recommendation 4.  Where necessary, flight crew associa -tions and operator management should establish a basis, and/  or process in which FDA can be used to assist in effectively  managing go-around compliance targets. DM Recommendation 5.  Operators and the industry should  re-define the stable approach criteria and SAH to better align  policies with manageable and operational safe practices. See  Appendix 10.3 for Flight Safety Foundation™s  Analysis: New  Stabilized Approach and Go-Around Guidelines, 2017  (proposed  for industry validation). Ł Avoid stable approach criteria and heights that address  very low-risk approaches. That is, avoid criteria that, if  exceeded, are not likely to result in a go-around decision, or  that, if a go-around decision is made, may transfer risk to a  higher-risk go-around maneuver Ł Distinguish between profile criteria (vertical and lateral),   energy management criteria and go-around decision point  criteria, which could have distinct and separate heights. Ł Allow for variable objective environments. Not all environ - ments create the same risk profile. High crosswinds, tail   winds and contaminated runways statistically create the  highest-risk environments. Ł The stable approach criteria, although mostly prescriptive,   should allow an element of guided riskŒassessed decision  making that is corroborated between crewmembers. DM Recommendation 6.  Operators should establish and publish  safe landing guidelines in operations manuals. (Burin, Keys to  a Safe Arrival) (Curtis and Blajev). See Appendix 10.4  Analysis:  Revised Safe Landing Guidelines, 2017  (proposed for industry  validation). DM Recommendation 7.  Operators should develop communica -tion procedures to be performed during every approach that   describes the state of stability and the intention of the decision  maker, based on company policy. Effective elements of these   communications include:Ł The state of stability is made by the crewmember not   responsible for the decision to go around (e.g., the PM or  the first officer, per company policy). This creates a shared  responsibility for activity in the decision-making process. Ł Communication procedures are active, not passive or   conditional (i.e., a call is made at the assigned point during every approach. This forces communication. 32 |Ł Communication procedures should be objective (i.e., they  should state facts about the condition. This minimizes  authority gradients within the cockpit. Ł Communication procedures should be sequential and esca - late (i.e., if the condition is not corrected to within limits, ac -tive calls continue and escalate to a defined point at which a  new directive call is mandated). For example, if an ﬁunstableﬂ  call at 500 ft AGL does not result in successful corrective  action, the ﬁunstableﬂ calls continue every 100 ft until the  condition is corrected or a critical point is reached, and then  a directive call is made (e.g., ﬁgo-aroundﬂ). This maintains  continuous situational awareness updating of the condition,   similar to ground-proximity warning system (GPWS) calls. Ł Active communication should continue well into the ap - proach and landing (e.g., up to the touchdown limit point).  This maintains continuous situational awareness. Ł Each ﬁstable conditionﬂ call should be answered with an ac -knowledgement or notice-of-intention call by the decision  maker (the PF or captain, per company policy). Ł The ﬁintentionﬂ call should not suggest the exclusion of  other possible outcomes (e.g., calling ﬁlandingﬂ at mini -mums when a go-around is an option can have the effect   of minimizing/compromising the window of calling for a  go-around. On the other hand, responding with ﬁRogerﬂ or  ﬁContinueﬂ assists in keeping decision making open.) DM Recommendation 8.  Operators should apply objective  feedback/communication procedures well into the approach   and landing phase, including in the touchdown zone. Energy  management monitoring and alerting systems will minimize the  need for crew-initiated calls. DM Recommendation 9.  Operators should create standard pre- descent briefing guidelines that include:Ł Environmental risk factors; Ł Instability factors that will result in a go-around; Ł A review of standard calls; and, Ł Decision making in the landing phase.DM Recommendation 10.  Operators should create standard pre- approach briefing guidelines that update the pre-descent brief -ing at a low-workload period just before the approach is begun. DM Recommendation 11.  Operators should understand their respec -tive managers™ and flight crews™ situational awareness levels and   psychological profiles for managing internal go-around policies. DM Recommendation 12.  Operators should provide training to  enhance psychosocial awareness and management, and how   they contribute to noncompliant decision making. DM Recommendation 13.  Operators should ensure no fault go- around policies are documented, implemented and understood   by management and flight crew. DM Recommendation 14.  Operators should ensure that un -stable approach and go-around policies are concise and unam - biguous, including follow-up procedures and expectations for  noncompliance.DM Recommendation 15.  Operators should communicate indus -try rates and internal go-around compliance rates, measures,  targets and goals of performance to flight crews and the manag -ers involved in achieving them. Operators also should commu -nicate the risk-reduction potential that improved performance  could have on the company™s overall risk profile. DM Recommendation 16.  State and industry audit programs, such  as the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), should establish  go-around compliance standards and recommended practices  for operators to manage go-around compliance. DM Recommendation 17.  State and industry safety organizations  such as those associated with the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO), the European Aviation Safety Agency, FAA,  IATA, the FAA Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) etc.,  should review these recommendations and assess inserting  them into their safety publications. DM Recommendation 18.  The aviation community should annually  track, through global aggregate flight data, go-around compliance  rates for both the approach phase and the landing phase of flight,  and communicate the findings to the industry. This role is suited  to safety organizations such as Flight Safety Foundation.  DM Recommendation 19.  The aviation community should  develop and implement an initiative that communicates the   industry™s go-around compliance rate, and the risk-reduction  potential that improved performance could have on the  industry-wide ALA rate and the overall accident rate. This is a  role suited to regulators, global associations and safety organi -zations such as Flight Safety Foundation.  DM Recommendation 20.  The aviation community should estab -lish a new information-sharing program to provide a method  for operators to share effective strategies to improve go- around compliance rates. Alternatively, the information should  be incorporated into an existing program.  DM Recommendation 21.  The industry should establish an identifi -able ﬁlabelﬂ for the threat/causal effect of the phenomenon of  noncompliance with go-around polices. As labels such as con -trolled flight into terrain (CFIT) or loss of control (LOC) make it  easier for the industry to relate, discuss, understand and manage a  phenomenon, a label for this phenomenon will do the same, and in  so doing, will help provide a foundation for essential awareness. 33 |The effective utility of each recommendation is different,  and each recommendation addresses a different finding or  strategy, as can be seen in Appendix 10.2. A holistic approach  to implementing these recommendations will have the best  overall effect. And as with any significant program change,  desired, and undesired, effects should be closely monitored  by an appropriate audit program such as FDA, line operations  safety audits, or IOSA. 34 |6 Go-Around Execution 6.1 MethodologyThe go-around accident and incident review included a non- random selection of published reports on go-arounds involv -ing transport-category aircraft between 2000 and 2012. A total of 64 go-around events were included. In some, the  safety of the go-around was central to the investigation, and in   others, the go-around occurred in the aftermath of the event  at the heart of the investigation. The majority of the events  (64 percent) involved single-aisle jets. Others involved twin  turboprops (20 percent) and twin-aisle jets (16 percent). The nature of the sample Š independently investigated events   in which an approach was followed at some point by a go- around Š meant that the sample group contained both safe and  unsafe go-arounds. Sometimes the investigations focused on  the circumstances that led to the go-around; sometimes they  focused on the go-around itself, and sometimes they focused on  both. Remarks contrasting the safe go-arounds with the risk- bearing go-arounds are, therefore, subject to the qualification  that the safe ones were just a non-random subset of many more  similar go-arounds that are routinely conducted because of   both crew decisions and ATC instructions. The context, safety aspects and overall level of risk of each  event were shown on a spreadsheet, with as many of a selec -tion of 185 ﬁtagsﬂ as were applicable attached to each one. Not   all tags were mutually exclusive, and not all reports allowed  the applicability of all of the tags to be established. The extent  to which many characteristics could be identified is, therefore,  understated. On the basis of the degree of risk posed by a go-around, each  event was assigned to one of three categories Š high risk (18   events), moderate risk (25 events) and non-risk-bearing (21  events). The non-risk-bearing events involved circumstances  Š some of which were similar to those of risk-bearing events  Š that were the main concern of the investigation. For the two risk-bearing categories, six ﬁheadlineﬂ go- around safety issues (GASIs) were defined in respect to the  initiation and execution of each go-around. Most of the 43 risk- bearing events involved a single GASI, but five events were   assigned two GASIs each. Each risk-bearing event was assigned one of three ﬁoutcome  risksﬂ Š LOC, CFIT or midair collision (MAC). The GASI definitions and their associated outcome risks  were: Ł AO1 Š Initiation of go-around ineffective (LOC); Ł AO2 Š Safe trajectory of aircraft not maintained once go-  around successfully initiated (LOC/CFIT); Ł AO3 Š Go-around not flown on required track (CFIT); Ł AT1 Š Safe traffic separation not maintained during go-  around (MAC); Ł AT2 Š Wake turbulence hazard during go-around (LOC);   and,Ł EN1 Š Significant low-level wind shear during go-around   (LOC). In the 79 percent (34) of risk-bearing go-arounds in which   the risk was attributable to the mismanagement and/or   mishandling of the go-around by pilots, failure to initiate a  go-around effectively was twice as prevalent as the failure to  aviate and navigate properly once the go-around was initially  established. In the 19 percent (8) of risk-bearing go-arounds in which  the risk was attributable to air traffic controllers, the follow -ing conditions applied: Ł One go-around followed controller failure to apply clearly   established procedures in respect to a late go-around,  which led directly to an unrecognized MAC risk resolved  by a traffic-alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS)  resolution advisory (RA). Ł Five go-arounds involved controller misjudgments in   dealing with the proximity of takeoffs to unexpected go- arounds Š a significant loss of separation in four cases  and an unrecognized wake turbulence hazard in the other.  Two events involved controllers talking to different aircraft  on the same frequency in different languages. In both   cases, pilots seeking to understand the developing situa -tion Š both before and after the go-around began Š were   deprived of valuable situational awareness. Ł Two go-arounds involved a single conflict between a pilot-  declared go-around and a controller-instructed go-around  in which a trainee controller under supervision in a non- radar environment was faced with an aircraft transition -ing to a conventional go-around, and the resulting need  to instruct the potentially conflicting aircraft, which was  on a required navigation performance (RNP) approach, to  fly an RNP go-around. The situational awareness of each  flight crew Š both on go-arounds in IMC Š of the potential  proximity of the other aircraft was compromised by lack of   procedure awareness. Decisions by pilots that were followed by poor initiation of   a go-around and that led to hull loss accidents  (accidents in  35 |which an airplane is destroyed, or damaged and not repaired,  including events in which an airplane is missing or inacces -sible) due to either LOC or CFIT were particularly likely to in -volve a crew in which either the pilot-in-command (PIC) or the  first officer was lacking in experience. For the PIC, this lack of  experience involved experience in either the aircraft type or  the role of PIC. 3 For the first officer, it involved experience in  the aircraft type or in multi-crew operations generally. 4In all events in which the experience of both pilots was fully  documented, one or both pilots were low on experience, ac -cording to the above definitions, in: Ł 80 percent of fatal/hull loss go-around accidents; Ł 73 percent of all high-risk go-arounds; Ł 64 percent of all moderate-risk go-arounds; and, Ł 60 percent of all non-risk-bearing go-arounds. Excessive confidence by the PM PIC that the PF first officer  would achieve a timely stabilization of the approach led the  PIC to delay takeover as PF. Often, by the time the PIC took the  controls, the circumstances had become more complex and the  chances of not properly initiating the go-around had increased. Conversely, excessive confidence by the PM first officer  that the PF PIC would achieve a timely stabilization led Š in  operating cultures that may not have addressed the effect of  a significant relative experience gap between the first officer  and the PIC Š to a delayed or absent go-around call and, in   some cases, to a near takeover or an on-ground takeover of  control in order to make such a call. The more-unsafe go-arounds are more likely than safer go- arounds to have been preceded by one or more of the following: Ł Significant procedural noncompliance, which was recorded   in 72 percent of high-risk events but in only 28 percent of  moderate-risk events, the same percentage as reported in   non-risk-bearing events; Ł A delay in making the decision to go around, which was re - corded in 39 percent of high-risk events but only 8 percent  of medium-risk events, an even lower proportion than for  non-risk-bearing events; and, Ł A complex situation at the time of the go-around decision,   which was recorded in 50 percent of high-risk events but  only 8 percent of medium-risk events, about the same as  for non-risk-bearing events. Significant violation of landing minimums, followed by a go- around decision, was a particular precursor of the nine fatal  3  Defined in this analysis as one or both of <500 hours on type or <500 hours in command 4  Defined in this analysis as one or both of <2,000 hours multi-crew experience or < 500 hours on type accidents during subsequently attempted go-arounds. Four -teen percent of risk-bearing go-around decisions were made   above 1,000 ft; half of these decisions were made because of  an unstable approach condition. Compared with moderate-risk go-arounds, high-risk go- arounds are more likely to: Ł Involve pilots with low levels of experience; Ł Involve a go-around decision made below decision   altitude/minimum descent altitude (DA/MDA); Ł Be flown by the PIC as PF; Ł Be at risk of LOC; Ł Follow a violation of DA/MDA; and, Ł Involve surprise that they have become necessary. High-risk go-arounds are less likely to: Ł Follow an unstabilized approach; and, Ł Involve a change of PF at initiation of or during the  go-around. Compared with moderate-risk go-arounds, non-risk-bearing   go-arounds are more likely to: Ł Follow go-around decisions that were foreseen as possibili -ties, rather than those that occurred unexpectedly; and, Ł Be made on ATC instructions. They are less likely to: Ł Take place at night; Ł Involve pilots with low levels of experience; Ł Have the first officer as PF; and, Ł Involve surprise that they have become necessary. They are just as likely to: Ł Be preceded by significant procedural noncompliance; and, Ł Involve a change of PF at the initiation of or during the  go-around. 6.2 Analysis: Go-Around Execution The go-around flight operations data analysis was performed   with the objective of examining the prevalence of a go-around  safety risk during normal, routine operations. More than  1,500 go-around events flown by jet aircraft operated by a  range of airlines from around the world were examined. The  analysis focused on the point at which the go-around began  and the way it was conducted. 36 |These go-around events were found in data detailing almost  500,000 flights. The majority of these flights (86 percent)  involved single-aisle jets; twin-aisle jets made up the remain -ing 14 percent. Data showed that 50 percent of the flight crews discon -nected the autopilot above 1,000 ft, 25 percent disconnected   the autothrottle above flare altitudes, and 14 percent discon -nected the flight director during the approach. Data showed the overall rate of go-arounds was 0.29  percent, or 1 in 340 approaches. However, it was possible to  distinguish two subgroups Š a lower go-around rate of 0.20  percent for operators that appeared more likely to subse -quently divert following a go-around and a higher rate of 0.35   percent for operators that appeared less likely to do so. The go-around rate for long-haul (twin-aisle) operations  was 0.40 percent Š higher than the overall rate. For single-aisle jets, the autopilot was engaged prior to  go-around initiation in 56 percent of the events and remained  engaged in 93 percent of these cases. For twin-aisle jets, the   autopilot was engaged prior to the go-around initiation in 69  percent of the events and remained engaged in 97 percent of  these cases. Forty percent of all go-arounds were initiated below 500  ft, 15 percent were initiated below the Category I instrument  landing system (CAT I ILS) minimum height of 200 ft, and 7  percent were initiated below 50 ft. Exceedance of the maximum permitted airspeed with flaps  extended (V FE ) was recorded in 2.4 percent of single-aisle jet  go-arounds and 3.4 percent of the twin-aisle jet go-arounds.  These V FE  exceedances correlated with: Ł Failure to reach and/or maintain the appropriate pitch   target; Ł Extended duration of go-around power settings; Ł An elapsed time of more than 10 seconds without retrac -tion of one stage of flaps (this applied in 50 percent of  cases); and,Ł Unstable approach. An overall association was identified between the height on  the approach at which a go-around was initiated and the pitch  attitude at which it was then flown Š the earlier the initiation  of the go-around, the lower the pitch attitude. The data showed a widespread prevalence of delayed flap  retraction once a go-around had been initiated, whereas in  only 3 percent of go-arounds did it take more than 30 seconds  to retract the landing gear. 6.3 Findings: Go-Around Execution A Go-Around Safety Forum Š initiated by Flight Safety   Foundation, the European Regions Airline Association (ERA)  and Eurocontrol Š took place June 18, 2013, at Eurocontrol   headquarters in Brussels. It was held in support of the Flight  Safety Foundation Go-Around Safety Initiative, to assist in early  implementation of the actions detailed in the European Action   Plan for the Prevention of Runway Excursions (EAPPRE), issued  in January 2013. The conference was attended by over 270 par -ticipants, including members of the French Bureau d™Enquêtes   et d™Analyses (BEA), who were conducting a study of airplane  state awareness during go-arounds (ASAGA). (BEA) The execution findings (Ex Findings) from the Go-Around  Safety Forum included the following: (Flight Safety Founda -tion; ERA; Eurocontrol;) Ex Finding 1.  Go-arounds occur at an average rate of one to  three per 1,000 approaches. There is a large variation of go- around rates among different aircraft operators and operational  environments. Ex Finding 2.  The go-around is a normal phase of flight, and  pilots should be encouraged to conduct one when conditions  warrant, as well as when they are instructed to do so. However,   since a go-around is the least flown normal flight phase, there  are particular safety issues associated with it. Ex Finding 3.  One in 10 go-around reports record a potentially  hazardous outcome, including exceeded aircraft performance  limits or fuel endurance. Ex Finding 4.  A go-around is a relatively rare maneuver for most  commercial pilots. On average, a short-haul pilot may conduct   a go-around once or twice a year, and a long-haul pilot may  conduct one every two to three years. Ex Finding 5.  Conducting a go-around carries a number of risks  including:Ł Ineffective initiation of a go-around, which can lead to LOC; Ł Failure to maintain control during a go-around, which can  lead to LOC, including abnormal contact with the runway,  or to CFIT; Ł Failure to fly the required track, which can lead to CFIT  or MAC; Ł Failure to maintain traffic separation, which can lead to   MAC; and, Ł Generation of wake turbulence, which may create a hazard  for another aircraft that can lead to LOC. Ex Finding 6.  The height at which a go-around is initiated during  an approach can present different challenges and risks: Ł Above the approach procedure minimum altitude; Ł At the approach procedure minimum altitude; and, Ł Below the approach minimum altitude. 37 |Ex Finding 7.  Low relevant experience of one or both pilots is  associated with difficulty in flying go-arounds. Ex Finding 8.  Go-arounds that follow a violation of approach  minimums are associated with a reduced safety margin. Ex Finding 9.  It is necessary for operators to be aware of the  extent to which go-arounds are being flown and the validated  reasons for them, as well as the extent to which the go-arounds  are flown safely. Ex Finding 10.  A just culture must prevail if problems in go- around safety are to be sufficiently understood and addressed. Ex Finding 11.  Aircraft energy states that are too high or too  low make the safe execution of go-arounds less likely, and this  situation can be exacerbated by a failure to understand how to  manage aircraft pitch attitude. Ex Finding 12.  The safety of a go-around is compromised by a de -lay in deciding to begin a go-around when the aircraft becomes  unstabilized below a mandatory stabilized approach gate (see   10.3.2, Approach Gates, p. 45). Ex Finding 13.  The decisions that precede unsafe go-arounds  are often made at points other than pre-determined procedural   decision points.Ex Finding 14.  Pilot go-around training needs to be propor -tional to the rate at which go-arounds are experienced in line   operations. Ex Finding 15.  The effectiveness of flight deck monitoring can  have a significant effect on the safe execution of go-arounds, but   such monitoring often is poor. Ex Finding 16.  Lack of an adequate understanding of automation  by pilots can affect go-around safety. Ex Finding 17.  Pilot understanding of how the pitch control  system works is not always apparent in their actions during   go-arounds. Ex Finding 18.  The potential for a traffic and/or a wake vortex  conflict during a go-around is sometimes reduced if pilots are   unaware of other traffic in the vicinity. Ex Finding 19.  Most pilots fly the potentially complex transition  to a go-around from a circle-to-land approach so infrequently   that maintaining competency will require an unrealistic amount  of recurrent training in proportion to other requirements. Ex Finding 20.  The extent of controller training in respect to go- around risk management is variable. Ex Finding 21.  Controllers sometimes issue instructions that may  prevent pilots from conducting a stabilized approach and may  thereby increase the number of go-arounds. Ex Finding 22.  Go-around procedures can be complex at a time  of high workload for pilots. The procedures are not always   published. Tactical de-confliction of go-arounds can place high  demands on controllers. Complexity is increased when there are  multiple approach procedures for the same runway, each with  its own missed approach point (MAP). Ex Finding 23.  Too much information in one controller radio  transmission (e.g., an explanation of the reason when giving an  executive instruction) can lead to pilot confusion. Late provision  of, or changes to, go-around instructions (including late changes  to a published MAP unless these clearly simplify it) increase  workload for pilots. Ex Finding 24.  Some pilots are reluctant to decline acceptance  of ATC instructions that are not compatible with aircraft per -formance, especially when issued at times when pilot work -load is already high. Issuing unpublished go-around/missed  approach tactical instructions at or after the initiation of a  go-around can place high demands on pilots. There is no direct  link between aircraft operator and ATC go-around training/ awareness. Ex Finding 25.  Current pilot go-around procedures may not  adequately address all the circumstances in which an ad hoc go-  around decision may be made, especially above 1,000 ft AGL or  after a decision to continue an approach made at DA/MDA. Ex Finding 26.  Go-around operational challenges are not ad -equately reflected in current regulatory requirements. 6.4 Strategies for Corrective Action: Go-Around Execution The Safety Forum discussed in depth the issues related to go-  around decision making, execution and training, and the air  traffic management aspects of safe go-arounds. Forum par -ticipants agreed on a series of conclusions in respect to eight  safety improvement strategies. Three of these strategies were  execution strategies (Ex Strategies) related to the safe execution  of go-arounds: Ex Strategy 1.  Ensure that go-around training and awareness ap -propriately reflect different go-around execution risk scenarios. Note: Independent CAST analysis determined similar find -ings and recommendations, which are outlined in CAST Safety  Enhancement (SE) 198. Ex Strategy 2.  Review go-around policy, procedures and documen -tation to maximize their effectiveness, clarity and understanding. Ex Strategy 3.  Ensure that low relevant experience of one or both  crewmembers does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitor -ing during approach, landing and go-around. 38 |6.5 Recommendations: Go-Around Execution The following principal recommendations for safe go-around  execution (Ex Recommendations) are based on Safety Forum  conclusions: Ex Recommendation 1.  Aircraft operators and ATC should im -prove their mutual understanding of each other™s go-around   practices/procedures. Ex Recommendation 2.  Industry partners should develop go- around training aids. Ex Recommendation 3.  Effective monitoring depends on ensuring  that pilots with low relevant experience are able to contribute   to safe go-around decision making and execution. Ex Recommendation 4.  Pilots and their employers should under -stand that one of the many reasons that violating approach   minimums is unacceptable is because evidence indicates that  if a go-around then becomes necessary, the chances of a safe   transition to the go-around are reduced. Ex Recommendation 5.  Pilots must be able to demonstrate that  they are able to safely execute go-arounds that begin from both  high energy and low energy states at the point where a go- around decision is indicated. Ex Recommendation 6.  Pilots must be able to exercise tactical  judgment, as well as procedural compliance, when deciding  to go around below a stabilized approach gate so that safe  execution is not hindered by an inappropriate delay in decision  making. Validation of this must be achieved through realistic  training scenarios. Ex Recommendation 7.  Go-around training for pilots should  include a range of operational scenarios, including go-arounds  from positions other than DA/MDA and the designated sta -bilized approach gate. Scenarios should involve realistic  simulation of surprise, typical landing weights and full-power  go-arounds. Ex Recommendation 8.  Go-around training for both pilots and  controllers should incorporate lessons learned from operational  events/incidents. Ex Recommendation 9.  Clear guidance should be provided to  pilots on how to act in respect to the three stages of monitoring   during approach, landing and go-around: noticing, alerting and  taking control. Members of augmented crews who are observing  should have a clear understanding of the nature of their contri -bution to effective monitoring. Ex Recommendation 10.  If an aircraft has the capability to fly  automatic go-arounds, pilot training should be provided and   the operator™s automation policy should address the go-around  procedure. Ex Recommendation 11.  Pilots must have a clear understanding  of how the pitch control system works on the aircraft type that  they fly. This should be validated by both theoretical testing and  use of suitable full flight simulator exercises involving approach  and go-around with full, rather than reduced, power/thrust  available and at typical landing weights. Ex Recommendation 12.  A review should be conducted to deter -mine whether pilots can lose situational awareness of poten -tially conflicting traffic during go-arounds if other pilots are  exchanging radio transmissions with ATC in languages other  than English. Ex Recommendation 13.  A high priority should be accorded to  the provision of RNP approach and missed approach proce - dures when current procedures involve circle-to-land and  when active radar surveillance of the transition to a go-around  is not available. Consideration should be given to withdrawing  circle-to-land procedures at airports where neither option is  available. Ex Recommendation 14.  Air navigation service providers (ANSPs)  should review and, if necessary, enhance the provision of go-  around risk awareness training for controllers. Ex Recommendation 15.  Ensure that the importance of facilitat -ing a stabilized approach and the correct application of final   approach procedures is included in training and in briefings for  ATC staff (EAPPRE Recommendation 3.3.1). Implementation Advice: Ł Training should include: a. Appropriate speed control instructions; b. Timely descent instructions; c. The importance of avoiding a late change of runway or  change in the type of approach; d. The importance of assigning a landing runway with no   significant tail wind component;e. The need to avoid vectoring too tightly onto final ap -proach and intercepting glide path from above; and, f. The importance of providing the crew with correct  information about distance to touchdown. Ex Recommendation 16.  The agency responsible for instrument  approach procedure design should ensure that straightforward  go-around procedures are available and published for each  runway. These go-around procedures should be designed in  consultation with pilots who are representative of those who  will be expected to use them. 39 |Implementation Advice: a. The principles, which underlie the MAP for each run -way, should, as much as possible, be the same. b. A low (e.g., below 2,000 ft) first stop altitude and an  early turn in a missed approach procedure should be  avoided; c. Conditional go-around procedures/missed approach   procedures (e.g., ﬁafter xxx but not later than yyyﬂ)  should be avoided. d. The (ideally common) missed approach fix should be  located close to the airport to ensure that an aircraft  in trouble can be landed immediately on any runway  with any track-distance chosen by the pilot. e. Procedural de-confliction of the missed approach   path from other traffic and from the risk of exposure  to wake turbulence, especially from late go-arounds,  should be provided. f. If both RNP and conventional missed approach proce -dures are published, then an explicit risk assessment   of such availability should be performed. a. Environmental restrictions Š especially noise-  abatement restrictions Š must not affect the design of  missed approach procedures if their imposition would  compromise safety standards. Ex Recommendation 17.  On final approach, pilots should be  advised of any significant changes in weather and/or runway  surface conditions. Contingency arrangements/procedures  should exist for use in wind shear conditions. Implementation Advice: b. Pilots should receive more relevant and quicker up -dates of weather-related information about develop -ments such as changes in visibility, wind and runway  status (e.g., quantity of water on the runway). c. Improved information should be provided to crews  about tail winds, wind shear and significant wind variation, including reports from preceding aircraft. d. Runway information should include items such as   braking action reports; information about the pres -ence of standing water, debris and wildlife, including   birds; reports of technical problems on the ground;  and reports of laser interference. Ex Recommendation 18.  Guidance should be developed for  controllers regarding the content and timing of go-around  instructions.Implementation Advice: a. Controllers should consider whether a go-around   instruction should be delivered in a separate transmis -sion from one that explains the instruction. b. Controllers must always use the standard MAP if there  is no imperative reason for an adaptation. c. If a non-standard missed approach procedure is to be   followed, controllers should detail it when issuing the  approach clearance. d. Controllers should avoid last-minute changes or in -structions except in emergency situations. e. Once a pilot has declared a go-around or is otherwise  known to have begun one, controllers should avoid  unnecessary transmissions. f. Pilot should inform ATC as soon as possible if devia -tions from the published go-around procedure become  necessary. Ex Recommendation 19.  ANSPs should consider the feasibility of  establishing a formal interface between pilots and controllers to  explore operational issues and reach an understanding. Implementation Advice: a. Pilots can be invited to attend controllers™ training  sessions, and controllers may be able to arrange to  observe pilots™ training sessions. b. ﬁOpenﬂ days can be provided for pilots to observe   operations at ATC facilities, and it may be possible to  organize familiarization flights for controllers. c. Pilots and controllers should participate in joint crew   resource management training. d. In establishing such interfaces, be aware that it is  most unlikely that the pilots participating in such an  initiative will be representative of those using the ATC  services involved and any such bias must be explicitly  recognized. Ex Recommendation 20.  Aircraft manufacturers should ensure that  go-around procedures presented in aircraft pilot training and  aircraft operating manuals are applicable to go-arounds that are  begun at any stage on final approach, up to and including land -ings that are rejected after touchdown. Ex Recommendation 21.  Safety regulators should review current  mandatory go-around training requirements for both pilots and  controllers and should ensure that the conclusions of this report  are appropriately addressed. 40 |7 Flight Safety Foundation Future Work 1. Establish a go-around noncompliance industry label such  as GANC (go-around noncompliance) or FGA (failure to go  around). This is to establish easy recognition, as has been  accomplished with other labels, such as LOC or CFIT. 2. Analyze and report, at a global aggregate level, unstable   approaches and unstable landings to determine the level of  associated risk. 3. Report global go-around compliance performance annually. 4. Develop go-around execution and training guidelines for   operators. 5. Establish industry go-around noncompliance audit standards  and recommended practices with organizations such as the  International Civil Aviation Organization and IATA. 6. In order to minimize the exposure to unnecessary go-arounds   while ensuring safety, further analysis is required to deter -mine the risk balance point between an unstable approach   and a go-around. The Foundation should ensure industry  partners pursue this analysis. 7. Promote the distribution and presentation of this report in  industry, and encourage republication in complementing  publications and safety initiatives. 8 Project Conclusion The problem of go-around policy noncompliance is real and   is arguably the largest threat to flight safety today. The  potential impact of improvement in compliance is signifi -cant. No other single decision can have such an impact in the   reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go around. The first and foremost change required is that the industry  must improve its awareness of the problem; to achieve this, a  shift in focus and cultural norms is required. It is believed that  significant improvement is attainable; however, the cultural  shift will be much easier if the industry shifts collectively, as   opposed to individual companies making changes on their own.  Having said this, several companies are already attacking this   issue internally. The project accomplished the goals set forth in the 2011  document announcing the FSF Go-Around Safety Initiative: ﬁto  understand the noncompliance by flight crewmembers, and  noncompliance of quality control measures by flight managers,ﬂ  and to consider the safety risk associated with go-arounds and  ensure that the transfer of risk is understood . There are several  useable guidelines in the appendix of this report; however, not   all envisioned products are completed, and this is noted in the   report as future work to be done by Flight Safety Foundation. 41 |9 Works Cited Honeywell International. ﬁProduct Description SmartRunway/ SmartLanding Functions of the Enhanced Ground Proximity  Warning System.ﬂ Redmond, Washington, U.S.: Honeywell, May  22, 2009.Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB).

Ł Specific types of approaches are stabilized if they fulfill the following: Ł CAT I ILS: within 1-dot deviation of glide path and localizer; Ł RNAV: within ½-scale deflection of vertical and lateral scales and within RNP requirements; Ł LOC/VOR: within 1-dot lateral deviation; and, Ł Visual: within 2.75 and 3.25 degrees of visual approach path indicators, and lined up with the runway cen -terline no later than 300 ft. Con˝guration: Ł Aircraft is in the landing configuration (gear and flaps set, speed brakes retracted). Energy: Ł Airspeed is stabilized within V REF +10 kt to V REF (without wind adjustments). Ł Thrust is stabilized to maintain the target approach airspeed. Ł Sink rate is no greater than 1,000 fpm. General: Ł The stabilized approach gates should be observed, and active communication calls made during each approach. Ł Normal bracketing corrections in maintaining stabilized conditions occasionally involve momentary overshoots   made necessary by atmospheric conditions; such overshoots are acceptable. Frequent or sustained overshoots   are not. Ł Unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions requiring a deviation from the above elements require a   special briefing. Approach Gate Objective 1Example of Active Communication 21,000 ft AGL Note: This can vary between  800 and 1,500 ft, depending on   aircraft category type The ˙nal landing con˙guration   should be selected.

Continuing past the related gate should only occur if meeting the objective of the next gate is achievable; otherwise, go  around.  Example: If the ˝ight is not con˙gured by 1,000 ft, it could continue if being fully stable by 500 ft is achievable. 2. If the call at the respective gate indicates an undesired state (e.g., ﬁNot con˙guredﬂ, or ﬁFlapsﬂ), that call should be repeated   at an appropriate interval until the condition is corrected. Example: ﬁFlapsﬂ; ﬁFlapsﬂ repeated every 50 ft. 45 |10.3.1 Stabilized Approach and Go-Around Decision Guidelines  (2017) Design Rationale The following is the rationale behind Flight Safety Founda -tion™s guidelines for conducting stabilized approaches and  achieving reliable go-around decision making. Why the  change? The current FSF guidelines were established in  November 2000 and updated in 2010. Analysis revealed that  facets of that guidance are not optimal for effective deci -sion making and that they may encourage go-arounds for   approaches involving very low risk. The overall goal is to  improve go-around decision making; in revising the stabilized  approach guidelines, four objectives must be met: Ł The guidelines must make operational sense for both flight  crews and management Š resulting in greater acceptance  of the policy. Ł Safety must be ensured during the approach by mitigating   against the common types of ALAs Š  ŁCFIT;  ŁLow energy (landing short, hard landing, tail strike); and,  ŁLanding runway excursions (overruns, veer-offs). Ł It must be ensured that the resulting go-arounds are con - ducted for approaches of appropriate risk, and not those of  very low risk in which a transfer of risk to a go-around ma -neuver increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases  demands on ATC. Ł The flight crew™s collective situational awareness must be   improved through better communication. Flight crews indicated in the Foundation™s project research   that current guidelines on when a go-around must be executed  are not realistic for most real-world operational environments  and approaches. They described what realistic parameters  look like from their perspective. The criteria for which a stable approach is defined can be  grouped into three types of parameters: flight path profile  (vertical and lateral), configuration (flaps, gear and speed  brakes) and energy management (rate of descent, speed and   thrust). Add to these the variable environmental conditions  (runway length and condition, and weather), and there are  four groups of parameters to be considered when designing  stable approach criteria. 10.3.2 Approach Gates We can address all stable approach parameters and ALA  safety issues at three procedural gates: Ł 1,000-ft AGL configuration gate (variable from 800 ft to   1,500 ft, depending on aircraft type); Ł 500-ft AGL stable gate; and, Ł 300-ft AGL go-around gate. The stable approach criteria are the same at each gate for ap -proaches conducted in both IMC and VMC. 10.3.2.1  1,000 Ft AGL Configuration Gate Previous guidance required that a go-around  must  be con -ducted if the flight was not fully stable in IMC. With respect to  the physics of a go-around, safety is the same in both IMC and  VMC; in this context, differentiation of a go-around at 1,000  feet in IMC and at 500 feet in VMC is not required. The new functional significance of the 1,000-ft mark is that  it is the last suitable point along the approach to ensure that  final landing configuration is selected and verified by the  flight crew. The flap and gear transition, deceleration to final  approach speed and thrust stabilization should occur before   the aircraft reaches the next gate at 500 ft AGL. It should be  emphasized that initial configuration  should  occur before  reaching the 1,000-ft gate; this gate is the last point at which   final landing configuration should be selected and confirmed. The 1,000-ft gate is a familiar demarcation to flight crews  and is often accompanied by an automatically generated  1,000-ft callout. Note that the 1,000-ft gate may vary for air -craft type and gross weight. The operator should determine   the appropriate height of the gate, based on aircraft decelera -tion characteristics and the manufacturer™s recommenda -tions. The following discussion of aircraft energy management   during approach is based on the FSF  ALAR Briefing Notes  (Flight Safety Foundation, 2010). Aircraft Deceleration Characteristics Although deceleration characteristics largely depend on the  aircraft type and gross weight, the following typical values   can be considered for quick assessment and management of   aircraft deceleration capability. Deceleration on a three-degree glide path, with landing flaps  and gear down: 10 to 20 kt per nm. Note: A three-degree glide path is typically equivalent to a descent   gradient of 300-ft-per-nm or a 700-fpm vertical speed, for a   final approach groundspeed of 140 kt. Example:An aircraft with a final approach speed of 140 kt would need   to be at a maximum speed of 165 kt at the 1,000-ft gate to be   stable at 500 ft. Using the median deceleration rate of 15 kt per   nm and descent rate of 700 fpm: 15 kt-per-nm x (500 (ft)/300 (ft/nm) = 1.67) nm = 25 kt. 46 |This gate does not address any particular ALA type but  serves to facilitate achieving a fully stabilized approach at the  next lower gate (500 ft). Additionally, it is in line with pilot  thinking, as seen in experimental data from the project, that  aircraft configuration and aircraft energy management are  two separate and distinct aspects of a stabilized approach,  and the aircraft energy stabilization height can be lower than  the aircraft configuration height. Although a go-around may be  considered  at this gate, not  mandating a go-around at this point reduces the overall   number of potential go-arounds by allowing low-risk unstable  approaches to continue at a safe altitude. (This analysis is  discussed in 10.3.2.3.) Improved collective situational awareness at this gate is  achieved through procedural active communication between  flight crew. 10.3.2.2  500-Ft AGL Gate Previous guidance required that a go-around  must  be conduct -ed if the flight was not fully stable in VMC. The revised guid -ance retains the recommendation that the approach should  be fully stable at this gate; however, the mandate to go around  has been removed. Although a go-around may be considered at this gate, not  mandating a go-around reduces the overall number of potential  go-arounds by allowing low-risk unstable approaches to con -tinue while at a safe altitude. (This analysis is found in 10.3.2.3). Not mandating a go-around at this gate also aligns with  pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project  findings, indicating a go-around can still be executed safely,  even from lower altitudes when conditions are stable or have  only minor deviations outside the stable approach definition.  As this makes operational sense to those who execute and  manage the policy, there is a better likelihood of compliance. The 500-ft gate is a suitable point in the approach for flight  crew to verify all stable approach criteria. It is a familiar demar -cation for flight crews and is also often accompanied by an au -tomatically generated 500-ft callout. Being stable at this point   in the approach allows for subsequent developing instabilities  to be compared against a state of constant energy reduction. Improved collective situational awareness at this gate is  also achieved through procedural active communication  between flight crew. 10.3.2.3  300 Ft AGL Go-Around Gate This 300-ft gate is new. Establishing this gate clearly marks  the boundary between higher altitudes where a stable  approach is strongly recommended and the point where  continuing an unstable descent reduces the margin of safety.  It differentiates between approach stability and a go-around  decision. These are two distinct flight issues, and from a psy -chological perspective, they should remain distinct elements   in decision making. It should be understood that the 300-ft AGL value is not  intended to be absolute; it can be approximated to take ad -vantage of aircraft automatic callout systems. For example,   consider an ILS minimum set for 200 ft AGL. Some manufac -turer automatic callout systems provide an alert 80 ft above   minimums, so in such cases, 280 ft AGL could be established as  the go-around gate value and utilized in the auto callout in the   active call procedures. Descending in an unstable state below the 300-ft gate should  be a warning to flight crews that the level of risk is increasing  and action is required, whether the aircraft is unstable at this  gate or becomes unstable below 300 ft. Analyses indicate that  flight crews who continue an unstable descent below 300 ft do  not recognize the need for increased concern Š or the need for  a go-around. The awareness of the increased need for action  can be improved by heightening the definition of the aircraft™s   condition, from being in an  unstable condition  to being in a  condition to go around.  This can prompt the flight crew to make   the correct decision Š to go around. Martin Smith of The Pres -age Group explains, ﬁThe psychological tipping point (this is the   moment of maximum situational awareness) is when the flight  crew is primed to pull the trigger on the go-around. The subtle  change to a ‚condition to go around™ is such a primer. In other  words, the ‚condition to go around™ is permission to act, permis -sion to comply.ﬂ Drawing a comparison to another industry  initiative, the pilot not flying (PNF) is now known as the PM Š  a change that was intended to influence the mindset of the PM  and also to alter his behavior in recognition of the importance  of monitoring. A similar effect can be realized in identifying an  unstable flight condition below 300 ft as a  go-around condition  Š a condition that demands a go-around decision. To further emphasize the point, the 1,000-ft to 300-ft win -dow can be viewed as the  stable approach zone , with the focus  on ensuring that the aircraft is fully stabilized. The area from   300 ft to thrust-reverserŒdeployment can be viewed as the  primary go-around zone, where the focus shifts from stabiliz -ing the aircraft to going around. Using a rejected takeoff below   V1 (the maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must  take the first action to stop the airplane within the accelerate-  stop distance) as an analogy, a rejected takeoff below 100 kt is  considered to occur in a different regime (low speed) compared  with a rejected takeoff above 100 kt, a high-speed regime. Here,  through training and guidance, there is a shift in psychology  for pilots operating in the low-speed vs. high-speed regime. A  similar shift can be realized through the approach to landing. Lowering the go-around execution altitude reduces the  overall number of potential go-arounds by allowing low-risk  47 |unstable approaches to continue while at higher, safer, alti -tudes. It makes the stable approach and go-around policies  more in line with flight crews™ psychological beliefs and more  manageable by management, prevents risk transfer from low- risk unstable approaches to potentially higher-risk go-arounds,  and limits unnecessary demands on the air traffic system. If not fully stable at or below this 300-ft gate, the decision  to go around should be made without hesitation. A go-around  below 300 ft is not necessarily unsafe; this determination  depends on the degree and type of approach instability, and   aircraft type and performance characteristics. This gate is  essentially the beginning of the primary go-around zone from  300 ft to thrust reverser deployment. At this gate, the low-energyŒtype ALA is addressed.  The most common types of low energy ALAs are landing  short, hard landing and tail strike. If we analyze the most   extreme case of low energy, it is one where thrust is at flight  idle, speed is V REF , and the descent rate is 1,500 fpm Š double  a normal rate of descent. U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) Part 25.119 says, ﬁIn  the landing configuration, the steady gradient climb may not be   less than 3.2 percent, with the engines at the power or thrust  that is available eight seconds after initialization of move -ment of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight   idle to go-around power settingﬂ (FAA), and, ﬁThe design and  construction of the engine must enable an increase – from the  fixed minimum flight idle power from not more than 15 percent   of rated takeoff power or thrust available to 95 percent in not  less than five secondsﬂ (FAA). The most limiting of these two  regulations is the eight-second requirement. In our extreme  low-energy case of descending at 1,500 fpm, using a linear anal -ysis without taking into consideration a lessening of the rate of   descent as engines spool, and achieving a 3.2 climb gradient, the  flight will descend 200 ft (FARs 25.119, Figure 1): 1500 (fpm)/60 (sec per min) x 8 (sec) = 200 ft Another useful analysis comes from Flight Safety Foundation™s   ALAR Tool Kit , which says that an aircraft being flown on a  go-around while on a 3-degree approach path, with thrust at  flight idle, descending at 700 fpm and with V REF  at minus 5 kt,  will experience an altitude loss of approximately 40 ft (Flight  Safety Foundation, 2010). If we more than double the rate of  descent to 1,500 fpm, in this analysis, the aircraft would ex -perience an altitude loss of approximately 100 feet (FSF  ALAR   Tool Kit,  Figure 1). It is also interesting to look at design specifications for TAWS  such as EGPWS. The technical standard order (TSO) for such  systems requires that, for the final approach segment descent, a  warning be given in time to allow for a 100-ft obstacle clear -ance altitude after recovery that includes a one-second pilot  response time and 0.25 g (0.25 standard gravitational accelera -tion) pull-up (Department of Transportation, FAA, 2012). The TSO further describes the altitude loss of an aircraft de -scending at 1,500 fpm, with a response time of one second and   0.25 g pull-up as being 64 ft, and says the required warning  should be given no later than 164 ft above the obstacle (TAWS  TSO, Figure 1). In comparison with these analyses, a gate of 300 ft AGL to  execute a go-around provides adequate altitude margin for   even the most extreme low-energy unstable approach. The  margin in this case results in a 50 percent increase over the  linear eight-second Part 25.119 determination, a 200 percent  increase over the FSF ALAR determination and a 370 percent  increase over the TAWS determination. Although the number of approach and landing accidents  is greater than the number of go-around accidents, the go- around phase of flight has more fatalities per accident. By   ensuring a safe altitude of 300 ft to conduct a go-around in the  extreme unstable low-energy case, and by allowing low-risk  unstable approaches to continue between 1,000 ft and 300 ft,  the potential number of go-arounds would be reduced, lower -ing the exposure to go-arounds risks. 10.3.2.4  Comparisons of Revised Gates to Industry Monitoring and  Alerting Systems, and FAA Runway Overrun Prevention  References The project identified significant decision-making benefits in  reducing the subjectivity of the decision-making analysis by  flight crew. The most impactful way to minimize subjectivity  is to employ automated systems similar in concept to EGPWS  Figure 1 Go-Around Altitude Loss Analysis Unstable condition: Speed V REF, Thrust Idle, Vertical Rate 1,500 fpm 050100150 200 250 300 350 400Altitude loss from 300 ft above ground levelFARs Part 25.119FSF ALAR AnalysisTAWS TSOALAR = FSF Approach and Landing Accident Reduction; FARs = U.S. Federal  Aviation Regulations; TAWS = terrain awareness and warning system;   TSO = technical standard order; V REF = reference landing speed Source: Flight Safety Foundation 48 |and TCAS to help flight crews make timely and consistent  decisions. The industry has developed a few systems Š in the  form of stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting  systems Š for approach and landing energy management. The Airbus Runway Overrun Protection System (ROPS)  has a number of alerting and monitoring functions, but those  that are pertinent to this analysis are the visual alert that  begins at 400 ft AGL and the aural alert at 200 ft AGL. ROPS  does a present-time evaluation of aircraft real energy and the  runway distance available for landing, and provides a visual   ﬁRunway Too Shortﬂ alert at 400 ft and an aural alert at 200 ft  (Armaund Jacob, 2009) (Airbus, 2013). Because of the lower  altitudes at which these alerts occur, and considering the  severity of the condition Š that is, not enough runway to stop  the aircraft Š a go-around really is the only option, except in  the most dire emergencies. When comparing this condition to  the conditions being applied to the proposed ﬁNew Stabilized  Approach and Go-Around Guidelinesﬂ (p. 44), the FSF guide -lines are quite conservative. Honeywell SmartLanding System also has many alerting  and monitoring functions, including aural alerts beginning  at 450 ft AGL and ending at 300 ft AGL with an ﬁUnstable,  Unstableﬂ alert. The criteria used by the system to make the  alert are variable but based on monitoring excessive approach  angle, excessive speed and flap settings ( Honeywell Interna -tional, 2009). Again, the altitudes where these alerts are given   are similar to those recommended in the ﬁNew Stabilized Ap -proach and Go-Around Guidelines.ﬂ 10.3.3 Achieving Collective Situational Awareness Through   Active Communication This project found that situational awareness is lacking among  most flight crews who continue an unstable descent and land  unstable. Communication is vital in achieving high-functioning  situational awareness. Two key types of communication are  recommended for improvements Š approach and landing  brief -ings,  and  active communication  SOPs throughout the approach. 10.3.3.1  Pre-Descent Approach and Landing Briefings, and   Pre-Approach Briefings Most airlines already have procedures for briefings, which ad -dress the most important aspects of the approach and landing;  detailed guidance is provided in FSF  ALAR Briefing Note  1.6.  (Flight Safety Foundation ALAR Task Force, 1998Œ1999). The  following guidance is not intended to replace those briefings  but is an addition to current standard briefing guidance: Ł Improve overall ALA awareness (statistics); and, Ł Improve awareness of specific approach and landing risks. As demonstrated in the project data, simply knowing a few  overall statistics can raise situational awareness signifi -cantly. When company statistics are available, they should be   referenced; however, in their absence, the following industry  statistics can be used: Ł ALAs make up approximately 65 percent of all accidents; Ł Approximately 3 percent of unstable approaches result in a   go-around; and, Ł More than 50 percent of runway excursions follow a stable   approach that becomes unstable after threshold crossing. Additionally, reviewing the effects of runway contamination   and tail winds on runway excursions is relevant because they   contribute to a significant number of runway excursions. The  Flight Safety FoundationŒled Runway Safety Initiative found  that about 53 percent of runway landing excursions are veer- offs; of that percentage, 66 percent follow stable approaches.  Of all veer-offs, 40 percent were associated with wind, and 39  percent, with runway contamination. The remaining 47 per -cent of runway landing excursions are overruns, and of that   group, 63 percent follow unstable approaches (Flight Safety  Foundation, 2010). This project found that awareness of instabilities is criti -cally important in the landing phase as well as in the approach   phase. Some simple rules of thumb regarding the effect of  poor landing technique on landing distance can significantly  improve situational awareness. For example, pilots should plan for landing distances to in -crease by (FAA, 2007): Ł 250 ft per second of floating;Ł 300 ft per 10 kt excess speed from V REF on a dry runway; Ł 500 ft per 10 kt excess speed from V REF on a wet runway;  and,Ł 200 ft per 10 ft excess above 50 ft over runway threshold.   This also applies when the vertical guidance for the ap -proach, by design, places the aircraft higher than 50 ft AGL  when crossing the threshold. Landing distances are based   on a 50-ft threshold crossing. Briefings including these statistics and rules of thumb should   occur at intervals that will ensure that flight crews have an in- depth awareness of the information, for example bi-monthly. Briefings also should discuss any allowances for flight  crews to adjust company policies (see discussion in 10.4, ﬁRe -vised Safe Landing Guidelines, 2017,ﬂ p. 51) as permitted by   guided procedures in the policies themselves Š for example,  allowing a crew to conduct a touchdown beyond the normal  49 |Pre-Descent Approach and Landing, and Pre-Approach, Briefing Guidance, 2017 A pre-descent briefing should include, in addition to existing approach briefing components, an emphasis on  approach and landing threats. When available, company statistics should be used. Periodically (e.g. bi-monthly) the briefing should include approach and landing accident (ALA) statistics; Ł Overall statistics: Ł ALAs make up approximately 65 percent of all accidents; Ł Approximately 50 percent of runway excursions develop from approaches that become unstable after  threshold crossing; and, Ł Approximately 3 percent of unstable approaches or unstable landings result in a go-around. Ł Runway excursion environmental contributors: Ł 53 percent of landing excursions are veer-offs, with wind a factor in 40 percent and runway contami - nation a factor in 39 percent. About 66 percent of veer-offs follow stable approaches; and, Ł 47 percent of landing excursions are overruns; of these, 63 percent follow unstable approaches. Ł Landing distance increase rules of thumb: Ł 250 ft per second of floating; Ł 300 ft per 10 kt excess speed from V REF (reference landing speed) on a dry runway; Ł 500 ft per 10 kt excess speed from V REF on a wet runway; and, Ł 200 ft per 10 ft excess above 50 ft over runway threshold. For each approach ,the briefing should include: Ł Environmental ALA threats Š contamination, crosswinds, tail winds; go-around readiness. In addition to a   normal go-around briefing, heightened readiness should be discussed in the event of poor environmental   conditions; and, Ł Any adjustments to approach and landing policy requirements, as permitted by written policy guidance   (e.g., landing beyond the normal touchdown zone if performance permits). Pre-approach briefing: Ł At an appropriate low-workload period, just prior to commencing the approach, crews should recap current   environmental threats, go-around readiness and any adjustments to go-around policy procedures. Source: Flight Safety Foundation touchdown zone as long as adequate landing performance  and distance references exist. Finally, as pre-descent briefings often occur 30 minutes or  more before an approach, the project findings and recommenda -tions suggest that a short update, or refreshment of the current   threats and go-around readiness, be briefed just prior to the ap -proach during a low-workload period in the lower descent. This   can refresh and ﬁtop upﬂ flight crews™ situational awareness. 10.3.4 Pre-Descent Approach and Landing, and Pre-Approach,  Briefing Guidance10.3.4.1  Active Communication Throughout the Approach This project determined that communication is one of the key  attributes of effective collaborative decision making by flight  crews. By a factor of approximately four, flight crews who  comply with their company™s go-around policy had communi -cated about approach instabilities, and for most crews who con -tinued an unstable approach and landing,  no one  made the actual  decision to continue; that is, there was no communication about  the decision to continue, it just happened. The difficulty with   passive/conditional calls (those which are made only if a prob -lem condition exists Š e.g., ﬁairspeedﬂ) is that in their absence, it  is undetermined if the condition exists. The call could be absent  for several reasons, as explained in the report findings. Active  calls, however, force flight crews to speak, discuss or express a  condition Š either positive or negative Š on every approach. It is also important not to overload the flight crew with  standard communication and to ensure that they have time to   listen to ATC and perform other tasks; therefore, active calls  must be short and direct. 50 |Active calls are usually initiated by the PM and responded  to by the PF. The PM™s call on the approach normally indicates  a condition, and the response by the PF may either be an ac -knowledgment or a directional response. It is recommended that there be an active call at each ap -proach gate. If the active call indicates an undesired aircraft state, the  call should continue to be made periodically throughout the   approach at intervals such as each 50 ft or 100 ft, until the  desired state is achieved or a go-around is conducted. This   serves the same purpose as a warning from EGPWS or TCAS. Active, repetitive calls in the 1,000- to 300-ft zone also pre -pare the PF for an eventual conclusion if the offending condi -tion is not corrected; that is, a go-around. Repetitive warning   calls prime the PF™s anticipatory, compensatory, hierarchi -cal and relational awarenesses, as compared with common   current procedures in which a sudden, single ﬁUnstable Go  Aroundﬂ call is made at 1,000 or 500 ft, which has a lesser ef -fect in primarily the hierarchical awareness.  The implementation of active calls should not imply that  passive/conditional and communicative calls such as ﬁglide -slopeﬂ or ﬁspeedﬂ be omitted. Passive calls remain an important  component of situational awareness and should be used in  combination/coordination with active calls , as required. The following are examples of active calls at approach gates  during an approach: If an airline has a stable approach and monitoring system  installed, such as ROPS or SmartLanding, the need for a  complete series of active calls throughout the approach and  landing is largely removed. These systems apply passive/  conditional calls; however, the nature of the automation  provides a form of reliability that passive calls from flight  crews do not.

Touch down just beyond the touchdown aim point following a normal flare, and not beyond the  touch down zone (TDZ). If not touched down within the TDZ (or revised touchdown point limit) Š go   around. 16. Touch down on the runway centerline with the main landing gear on both sides of (straddling) the   runway centerline. If all main landing gear are on one side of the centerline Š go around. 7. After touchdown, promptly transition to the desired deceleration configuration: Ł Brakes; Ł Spoilers/speed brakes; and, Ł Thrust reversers or equivalent (e.g., lift dump).

Source: Flight Safety Foundation 10.4.1 FSF Safe Landing Guidelines (2017) Design Rationale The following is the rationale behind the revised Flight Safety  Foundation guidelines for safe landing and achieving reliable  go-around decision making during the landing phase. As with  the stable approach and go-around decision guidelines, there  were several objectives, namely that the guidelines must: Ł Make operational sense for both flight crews and manage -ment to improve agreement with the policy; Ł Ensure safety during landing by mitigating the common types  of ALAs: landing runway excursions (overruns and veer-offs); Ł Ensure the resultant go-arounds are in situations of ap -propriate risk, and not those of very low risk in which a   transfer of risk to a go-around maneuver increases overall  risk, and unnecessarily increases demands on ATC; and, Ł Improve the flight crew™s collective situational awareness. The guidelines established here do not replace manufacturer   limitations and procedural guidance, or state regulations and  guidance. Excursions that occur following an unstable approach are  mitigated largely in the approach phase; however, they can still  52 |be prevented in the landing phase. Additionally, large numbers  of excursions occur following a stable approach that becomes  unstable only after the aircraft passes the runway thresh -old. Guidelines in this section are targeted at these types of  excursions. Landing excursions are of two types: overruns, in which  aircraft run off the end of the runway surface and veer-offs, in  which aircraft exit the side of the runway surface. To address  these types of ALAs, we will enhance landing guidelines in  four areas: Ł Longitudinal limit awareness (runway touchdown zone and   distance);Ł Lateral limit awareness (runway centerline); Ł Environmental variability and adjustments to established  policies; and,Ł Situational awareness and communication. Project findings include that collective situational awareness  is low during the landing phase. And although most opera -tors have policies defining where the touchdown should occur,   very few have guidance or SOPs on how to determine where  the touchdown occurs, or how and when to determine if a go- around should be executed. For example, most operators spec -ify that the aircraft should touch down in the touchdown zone   (TDZ), on the centerline; however, they do not train or specify  how to determine if the aircraft has passed the TDZ, who should  make the determination, or how much of a deviation from the   runway centerline is permissible before a go-around should be  conducted. Most pilots say either a gut feeling or experience  helps them judge when an aircraft has passed the acceptable  limit, even though they readily state that their experience does  not include go-arounds from the landing phase. The impact of improving collective situational awareness in  the landing phase can be significant. 10.4.2 Longitudinal Limit Awareness (Runway TDZ and Distance) Touchdown zones vary in length with one determining factor   being total runway length. Runways of 7,990 ft and longer  have touchdown zones 3,000 ft long (FAA), and runways of  2,400 m and longer have touchdown zones 900 m long (ICAO).  Relative positioning markings are present within the TDZ  and are clearly identifiable on a non-contaminated runway.  The aiming point is the widest marking located at the 1,000-ft  distance from the threshold (FAA), and 400-m distance from  the threshold (ICAO), with the end of the TDZ being identified  by the last marking at 3,000 ft (FAA) and 900 m (ICAO). Approach alerting and monitoring systems such as Smart -Landing provide aural alerts when an aircraft has passed a  company-defined touchdown area. When an aircraft passes   this area without touching down, an aural alert such as ﬁDeep   Landing, Deep Landingﬂ is given ( Honeywell International,  2009). SOPs then dictate a go-around. This objective warning  immediately enhances crew awareness and leads to better  decision making. In the absence of such a system, the PM,  through SOPs, can be directed to monitor the passing of TDZ  markings and make an active call such as ﬁTLﬂ [touchdown  limit], ﬁdeep landingﬂ or ﬁend of zoneﬂ after passing the last  marking indicating the passage of the TDZ. In cases in which the runway is contaminated and markings  are not visible, a couple of options exist. If available, runway-  remaining markers can be used, or, using the landing distance  ﬁRules of Thumb,ﬂ™ pilots can calculate that, for an aircraft  traveling 250 ft per second, the normal touchdown area of  1,000 to 2,000 ft will occur in four to eight seconds Š 250 fps  x 4Œ8 seconds = 1,000 to 2,000 ft. Calculations also will show that the end of the 3,000-ft-long  TDZ will pass in approximately 12 seconds Š 3,000 ft/250 fps  = 12 seconds. 10.4.3 Lateral Limit Awareness (Runway Centerline) Most operators specify that the touchdown shall occur on   the runway centerline, but do not say how this will hap -pen or who will determine when the aircraft is drifting. As   important as it is to have situational awareness regarding  a longitudinal limit, it is equally important to understand  lateral limits. Manufacturers often provide cockpit visual cues and  techniques for determining where the main landing gear is in  relation to the aircraft centerline. As an example, Boeing says that, for the 787, the view  through ﬁthe lower outboard corner of the pilot™s forward win -dow to the ground is a good visual reference for the outboard  side of the main landing gear wheels on the same side. The  lower inboard corner of the pilot™s forward window is also a  good reference for the opposite side main gear wheelsﬂ (The  Boeing Company, 2013). In the absence of other lateral limits, maintaining the most  outboard main landing gears on either side of the centerline  (straddling) is a reasonable limit. Using visual cues, as in the   example above, can help determine the positioning of the main  landing gear. This is considered a rough operational guide -line with its own limitations; however, there are no known   alternatives other than relying on ﬁgut sense.ﬂ The monitor -ing of this positioning can be performed by the PM during the   landing, and if he or she sees that the position of the aircraft is  incorrect, he can make an appropriate call Š ﬁDrift Limit.ﬂ In  that case, SOPs would dictate a go-around. 53 |10.4.4 Environmental Variability and Adjustments to   Established Policies Environmental variability can have a significant effect on land -ing performance and desired touchdown points. Operators  should consider giving flight crews the tools and guidelines to  determine when it makes sense to modify or adjust landing and  go-around policies for safety, and possibly operational efficiency.  It can be difficult for some operators to consider allowing a  crew to land beyond the TDZ; however, landing performance,  combined with sound guidance and policies for operating  outside normal definitions, makes sense when safe operations  are assured. ﬁBeyond over-proceduralization, we also have the   problem of rules with no room to apply judgment,ﬂ Kern said  in a 2009 book. ﬁMany of these policies begin with good intent.  But inside the good intent, we create systems that defy logic and  poison the well of fairness, which often results in an unintended  consequence Š loss of faith in the system of rulesﬂ (Kern, 2009). Problems can develop when environmental conditions are  such that operating outside established policies makes sense,  but there are no guiding principles on how to accomplish this.  For example, an aircraft landing on a 12,000-ft (3.7-km) run -way requires a 3,500-ft (1-km) landing distance. Although the  company policy states that a go-around should be initiated if  touchdown does not occur inside the TDZ, is it the best course   of action as opposed to an option of extending the touchdown  point to 4,000 ft (1.2 km), for example? Certainly, the answer   is yes, if the 4,000-ft mark is not definable. However, if the  flight crew can identify this point and if they have briefed the  revision to the policy, is it still the best course of action to  go around? In this case, the transfer of risk to a go-around is  questionable. A revised touchdown point can be determined  by citing a known distance point along the runway (e.g., taxi -way marking, runway distance marker or time period Š one   second approximates 250 ft (76 m) in distance). In another case in which weather and runway conditions  demand that touchdown occur before the end of the TDZ, guid -ance should give crews the methods and means to identify the  shorter touchdown limit. For example, if the crew wants to be  touching down within 2,000 ft (610 m) of the runway thresh -old, they need references to determine where this will occur,  using TDZ markings or time lapse (in seconds) from the time  the aircraft crosses the threshold. In any case, written policies and guidance must be in place  to give the flight crew permission, procedures and techniques   to modify a landing point limit. This should be briefed and  agreed upon by all crew.

In the  case of exceeding a centerline touchdown limit, it is difficult  to define a point in the TDZ where a positive centerline active  call can be made. Although not ideal, in this case, the use of  a passive/conditional call may be more operational; that is,  the call is made only when the drift limit is reached. Note that  stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems  accomplish the objectives of some active calls; therefore, flight  crew calls would not be required. 10.5 FSF Recommended Elements of a Stabilized Approach  (2000) [for reference] Recommended Elements of a Stabilized Approach All flights must be stabilized by 1,000 ft above airport elevation  in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and by 500 ft  above airport elevation in visual meteorological conditions (VMC).   An approach is stabilized when all of the following criteria are met: 1. The aircraft is on the correct flight path; 2. Only small changes in heading/pitch are required to main - tain the correct flight path; 3. The aircraft speed is not more than V REF + 20 kt indicated  airspeed and not less than V REF;4. The aircraft is in the correct landing configuration; 5. Sink rate is no greater than 1,000 fpm; if an approach re -quires a sink rate greater than 1,000 fpm, a special briefing   should be conducted; 6. Power setting is appropriate for the aircraft configuration   and is not below the minimum power for approach as   defined by the aircraft operating manual; 7. All briefings and checklists have been conducted; 8. Specific types of approaches are stabilized if they also fulfill   the following: instrument landing system (ILS) approaches   must be flown within one dot of the glideslope and   localizer; a Category II or Category III ILS approach must be   flown within the expanded localizer band; during a circling   approach, wings should be level on final when the aircraft   reaches 300 ft above airport elevation; and, 9. Unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions   requiring a deviation from the above elements of a stabi - lized approach require a special briefing. An approach that becomes unstabilized below 1,000 ft above   airport elevation in IMC or below 500 ft above airport elevation   in VMC requires an immediate go-around.

The customer stated   that the ramp at his airport is being repaved   and grounding points are not being re-  installed.    In recent years, there has been a change in   philosophy and practice with regard to   grounding. In the 1990 edition of the U.S.   National Fire Protection Association Standard   for Aircraft Fuel Servicing (NFPA 407), the   requirements for Ground ing were deleted and  requirements for Bonding were clarified.   The practice in the United States has been   to bond and ground, but tests have proven that   if the aircraft and fuel truck are properly   bonded, a grounding wire carries no electrical   charge at all. This is why NFPA 407 no longer   specifies grounding for safety during aircraft   fueling.  The NFPA determination was based on the   following points:  Ł Grounding does not prevent sparking at the   fuel surface  Ł Grounding is not required per NFPA 77,   Recommended Practice on Static Electricity   Ł Static electrical grounding points can have   high resistance, making them unsuitable for   grounding  Ł The wire/cable used for grounding might not   be capable of conducting current in the event   of an electrical fault in the ground support   equipment connected to the aircraft and could   become an ignition source if the wire fuses.     The Gulfstream Ground Handling and   Servicing Handbooks, and Aircraft   Maintenance Manuals have removed the   grounding requirement and call only for   bonding the fuel source to the aircraft during   any type of fueling or defueling operation.

We appreciate the input from our users  (Customers, Engineering, Tech Ops, and Field Service  Representatives) and their efforts for contributing  change requests during 2008. Anytime missing inform ation or incorrect information is identified, we  encourage you to notify us. This may be accomplis hed via a Field Service Report (FSR) or directly  through the Publications Change Request (PCR) system . Publications has taken an aggressive approach  to achieving our goals by increasing the number of  annual revisions to three for in-production aircraft  and two for out-of-production aircraft, for a total of 27 Maintenance Manual suites to be revised this year.  Technical Publications has also  launched a feasibility study for an  on-hands validation approach with  the help of the Service Facility. We are embedding te chnical writers on a non-interference basis to work  with technicians on the floor to better understand  their requirements and to allow them to give  immediate input when a publication change is required.   PlaneViewŽ Cert Delta Engineering released data  was included in 2008 revisions and enhanced the  accuracy of the G350/G450 and G500/G550 Maintena nce Manuals and Fault Isolation Manuals. The  Fault Isolation Manuals were further enhanced by intr oducing many of the observed faults that are not  electronically detected. We also enhanced the HyperNav  functionality that allows the technician to locate  components, connectors, splices, ground studs, and terminal junction physical locations on the aircraft.  In addition to maintaining this aggressive revisi on schedule, we are also  starting to develop the  Maintenance Manual Suite for the G650. Some of the te chnical writers have already been co-located with  the development engineers to begin writing the ma intenance procedures for the new Rolls-Royce BR725  engine.    The revisions Technical Publications has accomp lished to date in 2008 are  listed below with a short explanation of when the revision was distributed and what was incorporated.

AstraŽ/SPXŽ/G100®/G150®/G200® (ATA 27): Rudder Trim Actuator  Installation By Greg Miller, Director, Product Support GDAS    Rudder Trim installations on the Astra through G 200 aircraft are susceptible to water ingress into  the trim actuator housings. This has resulted in failure  either as a result of corrosion and/or freezing in  flight.    Each of the aircraft series has Aircraft Ma intenance Manual (AMM) instructions for the  removal/installation of the various Rudder Trim Compon ents. Included in the instruction is a callout for  the application of shrinkable tube, P/N ATUM-19/6-0,  at the Flexible Shaft-to-Rudder Trim Actuator  connections. These areas are highlighted below for th e respective aircraft Rudder Trim Actuators. There  is an additional callout for the G150 and G200 for blac k RTV (GE RTV-103) to be used as indicated in the  below illustrations.

ATUM tubing is radiation-cross linked, heat-shrinkable, and adhesive-lined to provide environmental sealing in a wide variety of  applications. The internal adhesive coating, when  heated, melts and flows to form a  positive environmental seal. The co ating adheres to the outer tubing  and the surface below, creating an excellent barrier to moisture penetration.    ATUM-19/6-0 has a 3:1 shrink ratio. ATUM is the se ries of tubing, the 19/6 is the expansion-to-shrink  ratio in millimeters, and the -0 is the color identifier for black.   Ensuring this procedure is properly accomplis hed will reduce the probability of premature failure.    G150® (ATA 24/49): APU Generator Grounding By Gary Schoonover, Service Engineering, Electrical/Avionics      Several G150 aircraft have reported  ﬁGEN LOAD UNBALANCEﬂ  status messages. In some  cases, the aircraft starts out with all generator   currents reading the same and the APU generator   current slowly decreases to zero.   A team from Dallas troubleshot the problem to   a poor ground for the APU generator return cable   at 10GND (see graphic). The plate to which the   ground is mounted was found  to be poorly bonded  to the aircraft structure. When the plate was   tapped, the APU generator current indication in   the cockpit would jump.    To correct the issue, technicians removed the   rivets, burnished the two mating surfaces, and   reinstalled the plate. Electr ical bonding practices in this area have been reviewed with production   personnel to ensure proper ground performance on   future aircraft.    If you have been experiencing load sharing issues  that have not responded  to previous maintenance  efforts, please consider this pote ntial solution. This condition is under evaluation by Gulfstream, and a  Service Bulletin is under consideration. Any futu re fleet actions will be communicated via normal  channels.     G200® (ATA 33): Operating Entry Light Switch Panel on Battery Power  By John Deputy, G150/G200 Model Manager     An issue surrounding the operational characterist ics of the Entry Light Switch Panel (CMS1 Cabin  System) has been brought to our attention by a G200 aircraft operator.    With the aircraft powered down and the battery ci rcuit breaker closed, depressing one of the entry  light switches causes the controller (P/N 2052-1-6) to  power up on aircraft batte ry power, initiate a 10- minute countdown timer and turn on the associated  light within the aircraft. The deviation between the  electrical drawing note and actual op eration comes about as a result of the length of time that the switch  is depressed.      The entry light switches are momentary switches that complete the circuit as long as the switch is   depressed. A momentary tap (  1 second) on one of the entry light switches completes the circuit long  enough for the controller to recognize the request to  power up in battery mode.  However, by the time the  Operating System (OS) and application software are  both running, the active low signal through that  entry light switch is no longer present, resultin g in a case where the 10-minute countdown timer and  10GND LOCATION  BREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    6associated light are unable to turn on, as both  of these functions are controlled from within the  application software.   Troubleshooting revealed that if the initial switch  press lasts for three to four seconds, there is  sufficient time for the controller to complete the boot -up cycle such that the OS and application software  are up and running. Once the application software  is running, the switch input can be recognized,  enabling the 10-minute countdown timer and determinin g which light switch was depressed to close the  appropriate contact that turns the light on. Altern atively, if the controller is powered up with the  momentary press on the entry light switch and is fo llowed up with a second pr ess a couple of seconds  later (now that the application software is running ), the 10-minute countdown timer is initiated and the  corresponding light is turned on.   The resulting action of a single momentary tap of  an Entry Light switch is the controller would be  powered up on the battery without the 10-minute count down timer being initiated that would eventually  turn it off.     GII®/GIII® (ATA 80): Both Engines Rotate with Left Start Initiation  By Bob Landers, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group     An operator contacted Gulfstream Customer Support , requesting assistance with an engine starting  problem on his aircraft. During left engine start,  when the start button was  depressed, both engines  began rotating. When he started the right-hand engine  first, the start sequence was normal; he then did  a left-hand engine start, with no problems reported.  Troubleshooting found there was 18 volts at the righ t engine starter solenoid connector with the left  selected for start and the start bu tton depressed. Next, the wire was removed from terminal 4 on the  start selector switch, finding 0 volts on the termin al, but there was 20 volts on the wire. The wire was  then removed from TJ6P terminal H,  and no voltage was indicated on the terminal, but there was voltage  on the wire.    The connector was disconnected from the Rotation  Amplifier with voltage going to zero. Removing the  cannon plug from the Rotation Amplifier, technician s determined there was an internal failure of the  unit. The Engine Rotation Amplifier, part num ber 26530335-01, was removed an d replaced, returning operation to normal.      GIV®/G300®/G400® (ATA 27): Control Wheel Oscillation from Horizontal Stabilizer By Denny George, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group     Recently, a GIV crew reported a control wheel osc illation related to the horizontal stabilizer. The  operator made a visit to a maintenance facility to ha ve the crew™s squawk investigated: Evaluate aircraft  for tail vibration, which occurs at 0.80 Mach or gr eater. Autopilot coupled  FGC 1 or 2, no aircraft  porpoising, occurs straight and level. Vibration stops with any pitch change.  The following was accomplished during subsequent maintenance:    Ł The elevators were removed, inspected, and balanced.     Ł Both elevator number four hinge bearin gs were replaced due to excessive wear  Ł Elevator curtains and attaching hardware we re inspected for defects; none were found.   Ł An elevator free-play check was completed with no defects.     Ł Elevator trim servo and cable tensio n was checked and found within limits.   Ł The primary elevator control cable rigging and c able tension were found to be within limitations.   Ł Numerous access panels relating to the horizo ntal stabilizer and elevators were removed and the  exposed areas inspected for defects. No defects were found.   Ł Horizontal stabilizer free play was checked from si de to side and the ﬁrub  blocksﬂ were found to be  within limits at all stabilizer settings.  BREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    7 Ł The elevator actuator was removed and re placed, and the removed unit was sent out for  evaluation.  An aircraft evaluation flight confirmed the orig inal squawk, with a few more comments: ﬁThe stab  appears to be loose. The horizontal stabilizer indicato r needle was moving in concert with elevator inputs,  with up elevator applied, stab needle would move up  and with down elevator input, stab needle would  move down.ﬂ   After reviewing all maintenance actions and co nsulting with Technical Operations and Service  Engineering personnel, it was dete rmined to investigate the horizontal stabilizer actuator. The unit was  removed, inspected, and found  to be defective. The stabilizer actuat or input shaft could be turned 6 to 10  revolutions in either direction before any actuator  movement was detected. There was also approximately  0.250 to 0.375 inches axial play when applying pre ssure in the extend and retract direction of the  actuator. These two conditions are what allowed th e oscillation to stop with pitch change and the  stabilizer indicator needle to move in concert with the elevators.    The horizontal stabilizer actuator was replaced, all  associated operational chec ks were completed, an  evaluation flight was made with no defects noted, an d the aircraft was returned to service. The defective  actuator was sent out for evaluation and failure analysis.   Gulfstream and Moog are investigating this di screpancy, and any future fleet action will be  communicated via normal channels.     G350®/G450® (ATA 32/33/38/73): Forthcoming ASCs By Merlisa Harrod, Customer Support Technical Bulletin Group    Following is a list of forthcoming Aircraft  Service Changes (ASCs) for G350/G450 aircraft.   ASC 045: Engine Fuel and Control (ATA 73) Engine Electronic Controller (EEC) Œ T5.1   Software Upgrade  Purpose/Discussion: This aircraft service change upgrades  the Engine Electronic Controller (EEC)  software from T4.0 to T5.1 and incorporates a forthcoming Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin.

Effectivity: Aircraft serial numbers 4001-4139 Status: This ASC is in development and targeted for release March 3, 2009.   ASC 050, Landing Gear (ATA 32) Dual Brake Metering Valve Replacement  Purpose/Discussion: This service change will improve the aircra ft braking characteristics during taxi  and anti-skid conditions. The Dual Brake Metering  Valve (BMV) has been redesigned to eliminate  sensitive behavior of the brake control system. The  dual BMV has an improved internal shuttle valve  that will eliminate pressure traps and pressure over-shoots, and reduce friction, oscillation, and delay. Effectivity: Aircraft serial numbers 4001-4139. Status: This ASC is in development and scheduled to release November 15, 2008.        BREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    8ASC 051, Lights (ATA 33) Light Emitting Diode  (LED) Tail Position Light Installation  Purpose/Discussion: This service change will replace the exis ting halogen tail position light with a  Light Emitting Diode (LED) assembly. The LED will  greatly improve reliability of the light with a  significantly longer service life.  Effectivity: Aircraft serial numbers 4001-4093. Status: This ASC is in development and scheduled to release December 12, 2008.   G350®/G450®/G500®/G550® (ATA 38): Leaking Lavatory Soap Dispensers By Denny George, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group       Several operators have commented  about soap leaking out of their  aircraft™s forward and aft lavatory  soap dispensers, Adams Rite Ae rospace Soap Dispenser Assembly  part number AR9116-DXXX. This  generally occurs only on high-altitude, long-range flights.    All incidents were narrowed down  to servicing of the soap dispenser. The filling instructions in the  Adams Rite Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) stat e: Fill the bottle with soap through housing. Do  not overfill.    The bottle capacity is listed at 5 oz. In the fault is olation section of the CMM, one of the remedies for  a bottle that does not dispense soap is to fill bottle  to capacity. However, when filled in this manner, the  bottle will leak soap due to pressurization at high al titude. The manual is not clear in exactly how much  soap should be used and indicates ﬁfullﬂ and ﬁfill to capacityﬂ as the reference marks to go by.  Based on service experience, it is recommended to  fill the soap bottles no more than three quarters  full, or 3.5 to 4.0 oz. This will prevent soap from oozin g from the assembly on long, high-altitude flights.  When serviced in this manner, no problems have b een noted. This informatio n will be added to the next  revision of the Completion Cent er Maintenance Handbook (CCMH).

As a result, we are pu blishing this reminder of the importance of using  the correct adapter when jacking the aircraft.    The latest style jack pad adapter was installed  by Aircraft Service Change (ASC) 155 for aircraft 501- 619 and is a production standard from aircraft 620  and subsequent. This modification removes the  existing MLG axle bushings, P/N 1159LM50156-1, and inst alls a Foreign Object Debris (FOD) cap at each  MLG axle jack point, which helps to minimize th e possibility of corrosion in the lower MLG axle.  Additionally, this modification changes the jack  pad adapter assembly  to a new part number,  1159GSE50214-3.

', ' The Missed Approach –\\nHey Where’s the Runway?1Missed Approach SegmentA Missed approach is a procedure used when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing\\nThe Missed Approach Segment is that part of an instrument approach procedure between the missed approach point (MAP), the missed approach way-point (MAWP), or the point of arrival at the decision height and the specified missed approach NAVAID (navigational aid), intersection, fix, or waypoint, as appropriate, at the minimum IFR altitude\\nIt is in this part of the approach procedure that the aircraft will climb and return to the en route structure or is positioned for holding or subsequent approach\\nThe missed approach route and altitudes are shown on the instrument approach charts2The Missed ApproachThe missed approach is one of the most difficult and critical phases of an instrument approach and is the one practiced the least\\nHigh workload, as the configuration of the aircraft must be changed (approach to climb out), coupled with new navigation route/Navaids\\nAn approach in actual conditions should be flown with the anticipation that the missed approach is an anticipated outcome\\nThe missed approach procedure typically includes an initial heading or track to follow, and an altitude to climb to.  This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix\\nBe sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach\\nFAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed:\\n1.  Whenever:\\nFlight visibility is less than the specified visibility for the approach\\nIf required visual references are not seen at either of the following times: \\nWhen the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or\\nUpon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DA/DH where a DA/DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that until touchdown.\\n2.  Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References\\nFAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA:\\nThe approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable\\nThe threshold\\nThe threshold markings\\nThe visual approach slope indicator\\nThe threshold lights\\nThe runway end identifier lights (REIL)\\nThe touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings\\nThe touchdown zone lights\\nThe runway or runway markings\\nThe runway lights\\nBasic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting\\n6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible\\nFull scale needle deflection past the final approach fix\\nNavigation equipment required for the approach fails\\nATC instructs you to go missed\\nUnsafe runway\\nTraffic\\nController or pilot navigation errors\\nWeather – e.g., thunderstorm cell\\nWhen the aircraft is being operated below MDA – loss of visual references\\nIf your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions\\nIf ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure\\nA controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions\\nVerbal Missed Approach Instructions\\nATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach\\nATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required\\nATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency].

', ' The Missed Approach – Hey Where’s the Runway?1Missed Approach SegmentA Missed approach is a procedure used when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing The Missed Approach Segment is that part of an instrument approach procedure between the missed approach point (MAP), the missed approach way-point (MAWP), or the point of arrival at the decision height and the specified missed approach NAVAID (navigational aid), intersection, fix, or waypoint, as appropriate, at the minimum IFR altitude It is in this part of the approach procedure that the aircraft will climb and return to the en route structure or is positioned for holding or subsequent approach The missed approach route and altitudes are shown on the instrument approach charts2The Missed ApproachThe missed approach is one of the most difficult and critical phases of an instrument approach and is the one practiced the least High workload, as the configuration of the aircraft must be changed (approach to climb out), coupled with new navigation route/Navaids An approach in actual conditions should be flown with the anticipation that the missed approach is an anticipated outcome The missed approach procedure typically includes an initial heading or track to follow, and an altitude to climb to.  This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix Be sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach FAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed: 1.  Whenever: Flight visibility is less than the specified visibility for the approach If required visual references are not seen at either of the following times:  When the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or Upon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DA/DH where a DA/DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that until touchdown. 2.  Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References FAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA: The approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable The threshold The threshold markings The visual approach slope indicator The threshold lights The runway end identifier lights (REIL) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings The touchdown zone lights The runway or runway markings The runway lights Basic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting 6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible Full scale needle deflection past the final approach fix Navigation equipment required for the approach fails ATC instructs you to go missed Unsafe runway Traffic Controller or pilot navigation errors Weather – e.g., thunderstorm cell When the aircraft is being operated below MDA – loss of visual references If your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure A controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions Verbal Missed Approach Instructions ATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach ATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required ATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency]. Be advised [Traffic...]“ If executing instructions different from those on the procedure as dictated by approach, call “on the go\" or \"executing climb out\" to reduce confusion 9Missed Approach Chart SymbolsTo provide ready missed approach guidance, approach plates use quick reference icons Due to limited space only four or less icons can be shown. Hence the icons may not show the entire missed approach procedure The full missed approach instructions are provided textually at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing10JEPP Missed Approach Chart Symbols11NACO Missed Approach Chart Symbols12Climb to altitudeTurn to specified headingTo Specified fixTrack RadialMissed Approach Point LocationThe missed approach point (MAP) on a non-precision approach is\\u2009not designed with any consideration to where the\\u2009aircraft must begin descent to execute a safe landing It is developed based on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and possibly air traffic considerations Descent below the MDA, including during the missed approach, is not authorized The Decision Altitude (DA) is an altitude derived location where a missed approach will be initiated on a precision approach Obstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach Decision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). 13Obstacle Protection Obstacle protection is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the DA/H or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA) A climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart When higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix Preplan your approach to ensure you can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile)  Higher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute) Tables for climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are on page D1 of U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets Formula: Required Climb Per Minute = ((_[climb gradient]_ ft/nautical mile) x ([ground speed] nautical miles/hour)/60) = 36,000 feet per hour = 14Beginning the Procedure Other Than at the MAP/DHIn the design of the missed approach procedure no consideration is given to an abnormally early missed approach turn from the approach course When an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC,  Fly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point  Remain at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver Can begin climb early, absent altitude restrictions Think CFIT when making an early missed!!15Circling Approach MAPExecuting the missed approach after starting the circling maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP The missed approach is executed for the runway the approach started on, not the runway you were circling to The initial turn on a missed approach will always be towards the landing runway until established on a segment of the missed approach Always think about how to execute the missed approach while circling so it is not a surprise if you enter IMC as aircraft is clear of obstacles only when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area16Since the circling missed approach maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost.Flying the Missed ApproachBefore the FAF  Memorize initial altitudes and headings Set up No. 2 Nav if possible for missed approach initial navaid course17Flying the Missed Approach Initial Missed Approach Segment ProcedureAt the MAP / DA Add climb power Rotate gradually (on-speed) to Vx Check for positive rate of climb Clean up the aircraft – gear and flaps up in the order specified by the POH Climb out at appropriate speed18CommunicateUpon execution of a missed approach and becoming stabilized in climb notify ATC If communicating with the Tower - \"[Place] tower, [Callsign], missed approach [Reason]\" If communicating with approach - \"[Place] approach, [Callsign] missed approach off of [Location] climbing through [Altitude] for [Altitude] with request\"19Lost Communications Missed ApproachIf communications are lost during the approach and you take a missed approach: Squawk 7600 Follow the published missed approach instructions to ensure adequate obstruction clearance Route: Proceed to the alternate IAF as filed and commence an approach Altitude: The EXPECTED altitude, if given one, after filing a “DRAFT” or; Your option of the highest of the two emergency safe altitudes depicted on the destination and alternate approach procedure charts if fields are within 200 NM of each other or At flight level 18,000\\' If destination altimeter is 29.92 inches or higher, fly FL180 If destination altimeter is less than 29.92, fly FL190 \"DRAFT\": Short flight plan including - a) Destination; b) Route; c) Altitude; d) Fuel State and e) Time En-route20NOW WHATDecide what your course of action will be Repeat the same approach at the same airport Another approach at the same airport Divert to planned alternate Divert elsewhere Hold for conditions to improve Consider fuel load and distance / time to a good alternate Inform ATC of your desires21Alternate Missed ApproachSome locations may have a preplanned alternate missed approach procedure for use in the event the primary NAVAID used for the missed approach procedure is out of service To avoid confusion, the alternate missed approach instructions are not published on the chart However, the alternate missed approach holding pattern will be depicted on the instrument approach chart  When the alternate missed approach procedure is implemented by NOTAM, it becomes a mandatory part of the procedure. The NOTAM will specify both the textual instructions and any additional equipment requirements necessary to complete the procedure You may reject an ATC clearance for an alternate missed approach that requires equipment not necessary for the published approach procedure when the alternate missed approach is issued after beginning the approach However, if the alternate missed approach is issued prior to beginning the approach the pilot must either accept the entire procedure (including the alternate missed approach) or request a different approach procedure22G1000 Missed ApproachAt the MAP, “SUSP” is displayed in the HSI and directly above the SUSP softkey Automatic sequencing of approach waypoints is suspended at the MAP A “FROM” indication is displayed on the CDI, but the course guidance is simply an extension of the final approach course  Do NOT follow this extended course When the message “RAIM is not available” is displayed in the Alerts Window on the PFD a missed approach must also be executed23G1000 Missed ApproachFlying the Missed Initiate the missed approach sequence by following the missed approach procedures as published / directed by ATC, for proper climb and heading instructions If not already using GPS as nav source, press the CDI softkey to switch external CDI output to GPS for guidance.  Press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic sequencing of waypoints If there is a missed approach course from a fix to altitude, Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to resume automatic leg sequencing After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD The G1000 will guide to the missed approach holding point and a recommended entry procedures for the holding pattern will be shown24G1000 Missed ApproachNote that the G1000 at the holding point again displays “SUSP” above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern The G1000 provides course guidance only on the inbound side of the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern to re-fly the approach, press the PROC key to “Select Approach” or “Activate Approach” (or use the Direct-To key to select another destination)  25G1000 Missed Approach Example Missed Approach Course From Fix To AltitudeAfter pressing the SUSP softkey, the missed approach sequence is automatically started with the course from fix to altitude leg After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey -  The G1000 returns to suspend mode when flying a course from a fix to altitude leg and indicates that automatic leg sequencing is suspended Fly the outbound course keeping the CDI needle centered. The Navigation Map Page depicts the flight path extending indefinitely from the Navfix. The distance increases and indicates the distance back to the Navaid Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic leg sequencing. Confirm that ‘SUSP’ no longer is displayed directly above the SUSP softkey The message “NEXT DTK 123” is the displayed, providing guidance to the holding fix. The actual desired track (DTK) depends on the ground speed and distance from the Navaid. Intercept and fly the inbound course, keeping the CDI needle centered As the plane approaches the Navaid (the missed approach holding point), a message in the navigation status bar recommends the holding pattern entry, e.g., “HOLD PARALLEL” Note that the G1000 again displays ‘SUSP’ above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern, press the PROC key to reactivate the approach or select a different approach, or press the Direct-To key to select another destination26G1000 Missed Approach Additional AutomationGA Switch (Go-Around)  Disengages the autopilot Selects the flight director Go-Around Mode, and  Activates the missed approach The GA Switch is located on the instrument panel above the throttle TOGA (Takeoff/Go-Around) Switch Offers automated go-arounds At the MAP, press the TOGA button Keeps the AP engaged Commands a climb Sets Autopilot to NAV mode and  Sequences to the missed approach 27Pitch-up IllusionPitch-up illusion is a significant hazard during the transition to climb out On approach the portion of the inner ear that provides sensory information related to acceleration—provides the sensation of stabilized speed, based primarily on the forces of gravity When acceleration and climb occur simultaneously as during the initial segment of a missed approach, two forces come together - gravity and acceleration The brain resolves the two forces (gravity and acceleration) as a single resultant force acting downward and backward. The brain incorrectly resolves the two forces as a single pitch-up movement When that occurs, the pilot feels as though the aircraft is climbing or that the nose is pitching up, when, in fact, it remains in level flight.   The normal reaction, absent visual clues, to the pitch-up illusion is to push forward on the stick with the risk of ground contact in a missed approach28Common ErrorsFailure to have essential knowledge of the information on the approach chart Failure to have initial steps of missed approach committed to memory Failure to identify DH or MAP or other condition requiring a missed approach Incorrect communication procedures  Noncompliance with ATC clearances, the published missed approach or an ATC instruction or failure to notify ATC of inability to comply Failure to accomplish checklist items Faulty basic instrument flying techniques Failure to accomplished a missed approach timely – e.g. motoring on to look for references29PTS Standards Area of Operation VI. C.Executes the missed approach procedure when the required visual references for the intended runway are not distinctly visible and identifiable: Non-Precision Approach – at the MAP Precision Approach - at Decision Altitude 30PTS Standards Area of Operation VI. C.Adequate knowledge of the missed approach procedure elements for standard approaches Initiates the missed approach promptly by applying power, establishing a climb attitude, and reducing drag in accordance with the aircraft manufacturer’s recommendations Reports beginning the missed approach procedure to ATC Complies with the published or alternate missed approach procedure Advises ATC or examiner anytime that the aircraft is unable to comply with a clearance, restriction, or climb gradient Follows the recommended checklist items appropriate to the go-around procedure Requests, if appropriate, ATC clearance to the alternate airport, clearance limit, or as directed by the examiner Maintains the recommended airspeed within ±10 knots; heading, course, or bearing within ±10°; and altitude(s) within ±100 feet during the missed approach procedure. Uses MFD and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position and track to help navigate the missed approach. Demonstrates an appropriate level of single-pilot resource management skills.31Questions32DisclaimerInstrument flight can be dangerous.

It’s European equivalent is ED-12B. A document that addresses the life process of developing embedded software in aircraft systems. It is a commonly accepted standard worldwide for regulating safety in the integration of software in aircraft systems.History of DO-178BSoftware in avionics has been around since the 1970’s By adding software to a system, certification becomes more complex. The RTCA creates DO-178 in 1980, while EUROCEA works on ED-35. The merged result is DO-178 / ED-12: the first common certification criteria for production of avionics software.Evolution of DO-178BIn 1985, revisions and updates were made to produce DO-178A / ED-12A. The documents became a worldwide basis for software certification in the aviation industry. DO-178B / ED-12B started in 1989 and finalized in 1992.DO-178B Document LayoutFigure 1-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”DO-178B Software LevelsDO-178B requires that all system requirements be mapped to one of the five software levels.  Level A - most critical failure level.  Failure at Level A results in catastrophic failure conditions for an aircraft.  Level B - the software at this level contributes to severe-major failure conditions.  Level C - software at this level contributes to major failure conditions.  Level D - software at this level contributes to minor failure conditions.  Level E - the software has no effect toward potential failure conditions.DO-178B Processes and OutputsDO-178B is divided into five main processes: Software Planning Software Development Software Verification Software Configuration Management Software Quality Assurance Each process has a set of expected documented outputs.Software Planning ProcessPurpose is to determine what will be done to produce safe, requirements-based software. Expected outputs: Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC) Software Development Plan Software Verification Plan Software Configuration Management Plan Software Quality Assurance PlanSoftware Development ProcessThe software development process is broken into four sub-processes: Software Requirements Process High-level requirements in relation to function, performance, interface and safety. Software Design Process Low-level requirements used to implement the source code. Software Coding Process Production of source-code from the design process. Integration Process Integration of code into a real-time environment.Software Development Process Continued…The following tangible outputs are the result of the combined four sub-processes: Software requirements data (SRD)  Software design description (SDD)  Source code  Executable object codeSoftware Verification ProcessThe purpose is to identify and report any errors resulting from the development process. The verification process objectives can be met with reviews, walkthroughs, unit testing, integration testing, and more. Proof of objectives is within the execution of the testing procedures. Outputs include: Software Verification Cases and Procedures Software Verification ResultsSoftware Verification Process Continued…Figure 6-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”Software Configuration Management ProcessThe purpose is to establish secure and effective configuration control for all artifacts. The following activities are done within the process: Configuration Identification Change Control Baseline establishment Archiving of the software Outputs include: Software Configuration Index, and Software Life Cycle Environment Configuration Index.Software Configuration Management Process (Continued…)Figure 7-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”Software Quality Assurance ProcessThe purpose is to provide assurance that the software life cycle process is going to yield quality software. Each process is analyzed to show that each process is producing the expected outputs. Any changes from originally proposed plans are reported, evaluated, and resolved to ensure process integrity.DO-178B Processes: ReviewDO-178B software life-cycle process is divided into five main processes: Software Planning Software Development Software Verification Software Configuration Management Software Quality Assurance The objective-based approach of DO-178B makes it flexible to individual projects.DO-178B CertificationD0-178B very specifically addresses the following which directly affects product development. Certification of a product applies only to it\\'s finished result. Certification includes approval of all systems and subsystems, hardware, software, firmware, development tools, production, and testing of the product. Certification is done on the individual application of the product Coding practices must be certified to ensure things like \"dead code\" are not allowed. Certification requires that \\'full testing\\' of the system and all of it\\'s components (including firmware) be done on the target platform in the target environment. Certification requires code testing at the MCDC level.The Future of DO-178CThe evolution of avionics software has forced a change upon the certification process. DO-178B was written absently in mind of older software tools. Advanced technologies and the growing complexities of newer avionics software needs to be addressed.The Future of DO-178CA committee has formed on behalf of the two major contributors (RTCA and EUROCAE) to produce DO-178C / ED-12C. Work has been started as of March 2005 and looks to be finished and published in December 2008. The document looks to tackle the introduction of new software development techniques among other things. I’m sure we’re all looking forward to it.References and Works CitedAvista Incorporated®, “DO-178B Basic Overview.” 7 July 2004.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The boundaries of the flight envelope will be defined within this document. All speeds are calibrated airspeeds (CAS) (requirement 4.4 ) and given in knots if not stated otherwise. All other units used are metric (SI units). The weights are given in mass units (kg) but the formulas require force units as input, therefore these are calculated in place wherever they are used. Note: The speeds defined within this document should be used for the placards, speed markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by flight test.

Maximum speed in level flight VH According to flight tests  at maximum weight and maximum continuous power at sea level conditions, the maximum speed in level flight has been determined:  Stall speeds VS, VS0, VS1 These speeds will be verified by flight test according to requirement 4.4.1 .  In order to calculate the stall speed, the maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane as a whole is determined first. The maximum lift coefficient of the aeroplane has been calculated starting from the polar curve of the wing profile taken form ref.  (p. 236, Re=2.9E6 flaps retracted  and p.237,  for the flaps in landing configuration, and  in take-off configuration). Considering the horizontal tail balancing force and the lower total wing lift due to wing lift distribution, the total aeroplane lift coefficient has been lowered by 15% with respect to the one of the profile.   Therefore aeroplane lift coefficient is estimated to   and for the landing configuration (since the span extension of the flaps is half of the span of the wing):  Stall speeds have been calculated based on these calculated lift coefficients. The wetted wing area SW is used instead of total wing area S because of a lower lift within the fuselage section of the span. Flaps retracted (take-off configuration):  Flaps extended (landing configuration):  Flaps extended (take-off configuration):  With . The stall speed in landing configuration (flaps fully extended to 40 degrees) is 44 kts. Therefore it is In accordance with CS-LSA.5 . In Take-Off configuration (flaps extended to 20 degrees) the stall speed is 47 kts. (Note: These speeds are estimates. The methods for the estimation can be various. It is important that these estimations are as precise as possible. Flight tests will be used to validate the stall speeds. In case the flight tests show different values, this might have an impact on the speeds used for design and ultimately might impair the compliance to the CS-LSA.5.)  Design manoeuvring speed VA According to requirement 5.2.4.1     Flaps maximum operating speed VF According to requirement 5.2.4.2 , such speed shall be not less than the greater of      and   The speed has been selected as:            This is the maximum flap operating speed for the take-off (at 20 degrees) and landing flap settings at 40 degrees. Flaps maximum extension speed VFE On this aeroplane the maximum flap extension speed is identical to the flap operating speed VF.  This speed is the maximum speed for flaps in take-off and landing configuration. Design cruising speed VC According to requirement 5.2.4.3    may not be less than:  and need not be greater than:  The speed has been selected as:  (Note:  can be selected to be higher than  .) (Note:  and VDF ,VD ,VNE correlate with each other. should be selected to allow for a minimum margin of 22% to VDF in order to be able to satisfy the requirements for the next subchapters.) Design dive speed VD According to requirement 5.2.4.4   For  a higher value than the one above has been chosen:  (Note: ASTM F2245-12d 5.2.4.4  requires an exact value for the dive speed. Indeed, such value should be understood as a minimum value. This will be clarified in the next amendment of the CS-LSA.)  Demonstrated dive speed VDF According to requirement 4.1.1.1  VDF must be less than or equal to VD. In this case VDF is equal to VD:  (Note: In case the demonstrated VDF is lower than VD then VNE needs to be limited accordingly which could have an impact on the selection of VC as well.) Never exceed speed VNE According to requirement 4.1.1.2  the VNE Shall be greater than or equal to:  and  must be less than or equal to:  The speed has been selected as:  Note: If the aircraft is equipped with retractable landing gear then VLO must be determined as well (CS-LSA.15 6.12.2). Altitude The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. In fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)  Manoeuvring and Gust load factors n Summary of limit load factors according to certification specifications and gust requirements. Table 2 – Manoeuvring limit load factors  Gust envelope Gust load factors need to be considered because they can exceed the prescribed maximum load factors at different weights and altitudes. Since gust loads depend on air density and aircraft mass they will be calculated for all twelve cases (sea level and 10000ft=FL100, maximum, minimum flying weight and minimum flying weight with full wing fuel tanks) according to requirement 5.2.3.3  with flaps retracted (requirement 5.2.6.1 ) and fully extended (requirement 5.2.6.2 ) at . The calculation is based on appendix X3 . To calculate the gust loads at altitudes other than at sea level the formula X3.1  is altered to include the density at sea level  as well:  The corresponding weights are defined within . Since the gust loads on the wing and tail have been chosen to be treated together,  is the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane (). (Note: the applicant should provide the method for the calculation of the slope of the lift-curve of the aeroplane)  Table 3 – Gust load factors V-n Envelope Below a typical flight envelope is shown. This specific one is corresponding to MTOW and FL100. For other design weights the shape of the envelope remains similar, with the difference that the gust lines will change (due to different load factors as per Table 3).

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. Within this document the loads on the wings are determined throughout the whole flight envelope  and for the design weights as determined in  under all loading conditions. The simplified criteria of requirement X.1  have not been used for these calculations. The Loads are calculated using literature methods taken from the documents referenced in chapter 1. The following assumptions are made: Applicable to LSA only; no compressibility effects; conventional configuration (e.g. no tandem aircraft, bi-plane or canard); no pitching moment of the horizontal tail (symmetrical profile); no winglets, no wing tip tanks; no sweep, straight leading edge, no twist, constant profile, no dihedral; effect of the wing deformation on the loads not considered; no spoilers or airbrakes; landing gear attached to fuselage;  no wing struts (cantilever wing);     References List of Abbreviations CG centre of gravity LE leading edge ISA international standard atmosphere by International Organisation for Standardisation  KEAS knots equivalent airspeed MAC mean aerodynamic chord MTOW maximum take-off weight SI international system of units  angle of attack of the wing [deg]  local angle of attack of the station i [deg]  wing zero lift angle of attack [deg]  profile zero lift angle of attack [deg] a lift curve slope [1/deg] AR wing aspect ratio calculated by  [] b wing span [m]  average wing span at station i (mid span position of station) [m]  wing span position of MAC [m]  average fuselage width at wing section [m]  maximum fuselage width (equals ) [m]  local angle between resulting force and normal force at station [deg]  average chord at station i [m]  mean aerodynamic chord [m]  chord at wing root  [m]  chord at wing tip [m]  shear axis relative position as a fraction of local wing chord []  drag coefficient  []  lift coefficient  []  fuselage pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift profile pitching moment coefficient []  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient [] D drag force on the wings [N] d span wise drag line loading []  wing sweep of the quarter chord line [deg]  g gravity acceleration [m/s2]  fuselage moment factor []  total wing lift force (on both wings) [N]  local lift at station i [N]  lift line loading on the wing [N/m]  total horizontal tail lift force [N]  total fuselage length [m]  fuselage length in front of wing quarter mean aerodynamic chord point [m]  taper ratio (equals  ) []  wing pitching moment with lift acting on its aerodynamic centre [N]  moments around y axis [Nm]  normal force [N] n load factor [] num total number of stations of a single wing; num = 10 []   density of ambient air at a specific altitude []  running horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  incremental horizontal shear force at station i (direction parallel to drag force) [N]  running vertical shear force at station I (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  incremental vertical shear force at station i (direction parallel to lift force) [N]  local resulting force at station i [N] S wing area (not including wing carry-through) []  local tangential force at station i [N]  total torsion around elastic axis of the wing (at wing root) [mN]  local torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  incremental torsion around elastic axis of the wing at station i [mN]  dynamic viscosity (for Reynolds number) [] v airspeed [m/s] W total aircraft weight [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload)  [kg/m2]  total weight of a single wing (with no fuel or payload) [kg]  local weight of the wing at station i (with no fuel or payload) [kg/m2] x longitudinal axis of the aircraft [m] distance to HT quarter chord line from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to aircraft centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to fuel centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local distance to wing centre of gravity from wing LE at station i [m]   aerodynamic centre shift due to fuselage pitching moment [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  aerodynamic centre of the wing-fuselage combination with respect to wing LE    (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local aerodynamic centre of the wing with respect to wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m]  local centre of pressure of the wing from wing LE at station i [m]  centre of pressure of the wing fuselage combination from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord)  [m]    shear axis of the wing from wing LE (at mean aerodynamic chord) [m] y lateral axis of the aircraft (span wise direction) [m]  average wing span position at station i [m]  spanwise width of station i [m] z vertical axis of the aircraft [m]  Throughout this document SI-units are used with speeds expected as m/s and angles in degrees if not stated otherwise. Requirements This document covers the following certification specifications requirements: Table 1 – Requirements   Input data The values shown below are derived from design data or other compliance documents for this particular aeroplane.   Load Calculation  The following steps have been followed: Load cases: First, the load cases have been identified in, in terms of weight, centre of gravity, speed, load factor, flap/aileron position, Altitude.  External Loads on the wing: for all load cases, the loads on the wing are calculated; Internal Loads in the wing: for the same load cases the internal loads in the wing (shear, bending moment, torsion) are calculated considering also the effect of the inertia of the wing;  Load cases Table 3 comprises all load cases corresponding to the points of the flight envelope  and design weights and centres of gravity .  Important:  Loads corresponding to flap deflected are considered not critical for the wing and will not be calculated in this document (flap loads will be calculated instead for the flap verification). Loads corresponding to landing conditions are considered not critical for the wing (since the landing gear is attached to the fuselage and no tip tanks or other large masses under the wing) and will not be calculated in this document. For the gust load calculations the wing and horizontal tail are treated together according to X3.1 in ref. . The resulting gust load accelerations are therefore calculated using the slope of the lift curve of the aeroplane (see also ) and treated as balanced flight conditions within this document.  Note: These assumptions have been considered realistic for this aeroplane but they are not of generic validity. It is the responsibility of the applicant to define the set of assumptions which can be acceptable for the particular aeroplane.   Altitude: The maximum permissible operational altitude is 13000ft. Despite the CS-LSA requirements do not require to accounts for the effects of altitude, such effects have been considered up to 10000 ft. in fact the gust load factor have been calculated at such altitude. This is considered acceptable since it covers the operational range within which the aeroplane will fly most of the time. (Note: the CS-LSA requirement does not require to account for the effects of altitude. Calculating the loads at sea level would be acceptable. In this case, the choice to consider such effect up to 10000 ft is a decision of a designer, which would be accepted by the team.)    Figure 1 – Reference flight envelope (WMTOW, FL 100) Table 2 – Design weights (explained in ref. ) Table 3 – Load cases Note: For this revision of this example document, asymmetric load cases have not been calculated. Loads on the aeroplane Reference axes and sign convention  Figure 2 – Aeroplane reference axes The origin is located at the airplane axis of symmetry (x axis) with the y axis passing through the leading edge of the mean aerodynamic chord section of the wing. Symmetrical flight conditions The loads on the wing structure arising from symmetrical flight manoeuvres according to requirements 5.2.2 and 5.2.3  are determined within this chapter.  The following abbreviations are used within this chapter (all measurements with respect to wing leading edge at wing mean aerodynamic chord, forces acting according to arrows are positive) x longitudinal axis of the aircraft z vertical axis of the aircraft CG aircraft centre of gravity HT horizontal tail L lift force on the wings  horizontal tail balancing force (HT lift force)  zero lift wing pitching moment coefficient (lift force assumed to act on  )  total pitching moment (must be zero for equilibrium) n W aircraft total weight force (= m*n*g )  distance to HT quarter chord line (of HT MAC as quarter chord line)  distance to aircraft centre of gravity  distance to wing fuselage combination centre of pressure   (lift force acting on not generating any pitching moment)  distance to wing fuselage combination aerodynamic centre   (lift force acting on generating constant pitching moment ) The external forces and moments acting on the aeroplane in a balanced flight condition have been determined. The\\xa0simplified scheme in Figure 3 is considered. The aeroplane is reduced to the wing and the Horizontal tail.  Figure 3 – Aeroplane simplified scheme The following forces are considered and placed in equilibrium:  Lift on the wing; Horizontal tail balancing load according to requirement 5.2.2.1 ; Weight of the aeroplane; For the calculation of the equilibrium, the z-axis of the aeroplane is assumed aligned with the direction of the gravity. In a second stage (section 6.4), once the forces are calculated, the corresponding angle of attack will be considered for the calculation of the correct direction of the forces on the wing;  Influence of thrust and drag (of the total airplane) are considered negligible at this stage of calculation of the vertical forces. The effect of the drag will be considered in a second stage on the wing only; The wing lift is assumed to act on the aerodynamic centre of the wing as a starting point. The contribution of the fuselage is accounted for as a shift of the point of aerodynamic centre. This is better explained in section 6.1.5. The HT lift is applied at 25% of the chord; Effects of structural flexure are considered negligible; Angular accelerations are disregarded until the aeroplane has attained the prescribed load factor (according to requirement 5.2.2.3 ); Note: The assumptions above provide a clear simplification to the calculations. The fact that they are used here does not mean that they can always be used. It is the responsibility of the designer to make the appropriate assumptions and to agree them with the Agency. Based on the above assumptions the following equilibrium equations are set. The basis system of equations include 4 equations with the following unknowns: L: wing Lift (including fuselage) CL: wing lift coefficient LHT: HT lift XAC f+w: aerodynamic centre w+f (wing + fuselage; see sec. 6.1.3 and 6.1.5) Equilibrium of moments  (f. 6.1.2.1) Equilibrium of forces   (f. 6.1.2.2) wing pitching moment   (f.6.1.2.3) (for wing) wing lift coefficient  (f. 6.1.2.4) Aerodynamic centre The aerodynamic centre is a characteristic of the wing and it is defined as the point about which the pitch moment does not change with changes of the angle of attack throughout the linear range of the lift curve.  According to  the aerodynamic centre can be estimated by adding a correction factor (shift) to the quarter chord point of the mean aerodynamic chord. The correction factor is a function of the maximum thickness of the profile which in this wing is 16% of the chord. For a tapered wing, the mean aerodynamic chord corresponds to the mean chord and it is  (see ). For this wing the correction factor is 0.012 (from Fig.2  at 16% thickness), so the mean aerodynamic centre of the wing without fuselage is    (f. 6.1.3.1) Pitching moment of the wing The pitching moment of the profile from two dimensional wind tunnel test data  does not represent the moment of a three dimensional with the profile. The pitching moment of the whole wing is calculated according to DATCOM method 1 (formula 4.1.4.1.a ).  (formula 4.1.4.1.a ) (f. 6.1.4.1) With quarter chord sweep angle of the wing .   Influence of the fuselage The fuselage is assumed to provide negligible lift. On the other hand, its influence on the aeroplane equilibrium is accounted for as a contribution to the pitching moment. In particular the following formula (taken from ref ) provides the shift of the aerodynamic centre of the wing due to fuselage pitching moment.  (f. 6.1.5.1) With  and  as input to the diagram in  yielding  and a correction factor of 1.05 due to low-wing configuration. The shift of aerodynamic centre, due to the fuselage, is calculated as:   (f. 6.1.5.2) Forces and moments acting on the wings In previous chapter the Lift and the lift coefficient have been determined. Having those as inputs, the drag and angle of attack are calculated. Total wing drag coefficient  (FIG. X2.1 of)(f. 6.2.1) Drag force on the wings  (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.2) The angle of attack (using as reference instead of ) for each load case is calculated using the following formula:   (FIG. X2.1 of) (f. 6.2.3) Where: lift curve slope    (FIG. X2.1 of ) (f. 6.2.4) and the zero-lift angle of the wing is taken as . This value is the zero-lift angle of the corresponding wing profile, taken from ref  (p.236).   The results of this chapter for the load cases highlighted in subchapter 0 are presented within the table below. Table 4 – Loads on the aeroplane Unsymmetrical flight conditions Note: These load cases will not be calculated within this revision of the example document.   Wing load distribution After having calculated the total load on the wing, the load distribution is calculated and shown in the following sections. Every load is assumed to act on the span wise centre of each station.  Figure 4 – Location of wing stations Wing lift distribution The wing lift distribution is calculated here. The lift contribution of the fuselage is assumed to be zero (this means that the load which would act in correspondence of the fuselage, is shifted externally to the wing) leading to more conservative results on the wing loads since they provide higher bending. Note: Alternatively, the applicant would have to determine the reduction in wing lift distribution at the location of the fuselage and demonstrate the validity of the approach.  Figure 5 – Effect of the fuselage, areas A (total lift calculated at the end of this chapter)  and B (total lift according to Schrenk) are of equal size   This approach is based on the approximation described by Schrenk  and requires adjustments: moving the apex of the elliptical distribution from the fuselage centre towards the wing root increasing lift of wetted wing sections to compensate for zero lift of fuselage wing section The formula for wing lift distribution is derived from Schrenk  and is altered to assume zero lift at the wing section within the fuselage as shown below. The formula gives the value of the lift for span unit. “i” identifies the individual station.   Figure 6 –  lift distribution with zero lift at fuselage wing section   ()  (f. 6.4.1.1) Now the lift of the wing section within the fuselage is redistributed across the wetted wing area to achieve conservative results. The lift distribution calculated above is adjusted by multiplication of a correction factor derived from comparison between total lift of the whole wing including the fuselage section and the wetted wing only.  Figure 7 – Fuselage wing section lift redistributed across wetted wing stations        or  (f. 6.4.1.2) The lift distribution corresponding to the formula above, gives a value of lift at wing tip which is higher than zero and therefore does not fully reproduce the actual loading (the winglift is normally zero at the tip). Nevertheless this assumption does not give significant changes and yields conservative results. The local angle of attack for the station I, as a result of this corrected Schrenk distribution, is given by the following formula:  (from f.6.2.3 and f.6.1.2.4) (f. 6.4.1.3) Note: FAA AC 23-19A, paragraph 23.301, contains other acceptable methods.   Figure 9 – Span wise lift distribution  Wing drag distribution Since the effect of the drag is negligible, when compared to the effect of the lift, the span wise drag distribution has been assumed constant throughout wing span. This is a conservative assumption. The drag loading per metre of span:   (f. 6.4.2.1) Wing and fuel mass distribution The local masses are calculated for each wing station to account for the mass of the structure of the wing including the systems and control surfaces (control systems, and other equipment). It is assumed that the wing has a linear distribution proportional to the chord. At each station the point of application of the mass is 45% of the chord.  Figure 10 – Wing mass distribution  Figure 11 – Fuel distribution A constant fuel distribution (at a point of application of 20% of the chord) is assumed throughout the fuel tank span.  Table 5 – Mass distribution with full fuel Wing torsion distribution At each station, the wing lift is assumed to be acting at the local centre of pressure, which is calculated using the formula:  (from eq. 9.17.(d) )  (f. 6.4.4.1) Where, ci is the chord at each station, cm0_w_i is the pitching moment around the aerodynamic centre of the wing section (it is -0.0436 across the wing from chapter 6.1.4), CL_i is the local lift coefficient and comes from the corrected Schrenk distribution () in 6.1.5. Therefore centre of pressure location is dependent on the local angle of attack. Each station’s lift force acts on its centre of pressure and imposes torsion around the wing elastic axis which for this aeroplane is located approximately at a constant chord percentage of 30% (see design data - the main spar is approximately at 25% of the chord) throughout the entire wing span with local positions  as local shear centres at the stations. Note: the location of the elastic axis for this wing has been assumed at 30%. It is responsibility of the applicant to determine and justify the location of the elastic axis.  Incremental torsion load on structure at each station with respect to local wing shear centre including contribution of fuel and wing structure inertia forces:   (f..2) Torsion at each station i (with respect to shear centre) is:    (f. 6.4.4.3) Distribution of internal loads The components of the internal loads on the wing structure are calculated in different steps for each station. The flight load factor n is assumed to act in parallel to the direction of the lift force instead of the direction of the normal force (As required by 5.2.1.1 of ref. ). The difference is assumed negligible. The incremental shear load parallel to lift force vector at station i is taking into account also the inertia unloading of the wing   (f. 6.4.5.1) Incremental shear load parallel to drag force vector at station i:   (f. 6.4.5.2) With  representing the width of the station i. The summation of incremental shear loads throughout the stations to obtain the absolute shear loads at station i is presented below. Shear load parallel to lift force vector   (f..3) Shear load parallel to drag force vector   (f. 6.4.5.4) The components of the loads along the normal and tangential directions are derived by using the following formulas and figure:  Figure 12 – Forces components on the wing (The tangential force is oriented opposite to the x axis and is therefore positive when directed towards the front of the aeroplane.) Resulting force angle   (f.6.4.5.5)  Shear loads along the directions of:  resulting force  (f. 6.4.5.6)  tangential force  (f. 6.4.5.7)  normal force  (f. 6.4.5.8) With the local angle of attack for the station i as a result of the corrected Schrenk distribution given by the following formula:  (from f. 6.4.1.4) Summation of shear loads to obtain the bending moments at each station and using the increased lever arm ( instead of  ) at the wing tip station results in slightly more conservative values. Bending moment along normal direction   (f. 6.4.5.9) Bending moment along tangential direction    (f. 6.4.5.10) The results are presented within the graphs and tables below.

The requirements are referenced in the compliance checklist of the certification programme ABCD-CP-00. The permissible centre of gravity range is dictated by the aerodynamic design requirements for the airplane. Then the centre of gravity locations corresponding to the critical weights are calculated. All units used are metric (SI units) except for airspeeds (CAS) given in knots if not stated otherwise. Note: The values defined within this document should be used for the placards, markings, aeroplane flight manual (limitations), load calculations and need to be verified by testing.

The data contained herein is used to establish aeroplane loading limits: Table 2 – Mass items (Note: In this document the weight of the empty aircraft is assumed to be determined through direct weighing. Such information might be needed during early phases of the design, when no prototype is available. In this case the weight of the empty aircraft should be determined through estimation. It is important in this case to have a breakdown of the main items in terms of weight and locations, so that the weight can be kept under control and avoid situations where the assumed envelope cannot be achieved.) Aircraft weights The following design weights have been identified since: either they are clearly required by the CS-LSA requirements, or they impose critical loads or flight characteristics. Basic empty weight WBEW The basic empty weight needs to be determined to identify its centre of gravity according to requirement 4.2.3  as empty CG. All load conditions determined within this document are based on the basic empty weight of the aircraft. It includes empty weight of the aircraft and the unusable amount of fuel. Basic empty weight has been determined to WBEW = 366 kg. Note: The basic empty weight must include all equipment for the operation intended including optional avionics packages – for example. Basic empty weight (366 kg) vs maximum empty weight WMEW (400kg) According to 4.2.1 of , the minimum useful load  should be 200kg consisting of 172Kg = both seats occupied with persons of 86kg each (4.2.1.1 ) 28kg = fuel for 1 hour flight at  as determined by  (4.2.1.2 ) According to 3.1.2  the maximum empty weight of the aeroplane shall be equal to: . The aeroplane complies with its Basic empty weight including unusable fuel: . Minimum flying weight Wmin (421kg) The minimum flying weight needs to be determined by requirement 4.2.2  and is a design load case leading to highest load factors during gust penetration. It assumes only a pilot of weight of 55 kg.  Minimum full fuel flying weight WminFF (495kg) The minimum flying weight with full fuel is a design load case imposing highest load factors on the fuel tank. This is critical for the fuel tank design and it can be critical also for the wing structure since in this scenario the highest inertia load on the fuel tank introduces torsion about the shear centre in the same direction of the wing aerodynamic load of the wing (the CG of the fuel is forward to the shear centre which is forward to the wing centre of pressure). Maximum zero wing fuel weight WZWF (600kg) The maximum zero wing fuel weight needs to be determined by requirement 5.2.1.3  and is a design load case for the wing loads due to lowest inertia discharge of the wing structure. In this aeroplane this weight equals the Maximum Take-off weight.  Maximum take-off weight WMTOW (600kg) The total aircraft weight must not exceed 600kg regardless whether the aircraft is on ground or in flight. The gross weight of the aeroplane shall not exceed WMTOW = 600kg. The maximum landing weight equals the maximum take-off weight. Loading cases The following loading conditions have been established to identify the critical cases. Table 3 – Loading cases for standard configuration   Centre of gravity location The maximum permissible centre of gravity locations are defined within this chapter. Flight limits The maximum permissible centre of gravity range during flight with respect to datum plane is most forward 0.25m   (required by  4.2.3) most rearward 0.39m   (required by  4.2.3) Limitations on ground The most rearward centre of gravity with the plane on ground must not exceed (with respect to datum plane) 0.46m to prevent the aircraft from flipping on the tail although not more than 0.41m might be reached with the most critical loading configuration. Centre of gravity envelope The following table of load cases defines the limits for the certified envelope of centre of gravity locations and the position of load cases of 6.7 within the envelope. Table 4 – Load cases on centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration   The centre of gravity envelope covers all valid loading cases.  Figure 1 – Centre of gravity envelope for standard configuration Expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification To cover alterations to the aeroplane where need might arise or after certification the aeroplane will be tested and certified against an extended envelope. Additional weights will be added during testing at their corresponding locations to establish the desired loading cases. Table 5 – Weights required to achieve expanded envelope for certification   The expanded centre of gravity envelope is defined by the load cases below using ballast weights at their corresponding locations. Table 6 – Load cases on expanded centre of gravity envelope for certification Note: The values above are preliminary assumptions. Ballast weights need to be checked to be in accordance with airframe strength limitations and their impact on the flight characteristics in terms of inertia before test flights. This might require narrowing the centre of gravity envelope.

Pilots are expected to remain within the protected airspace (the holding side). One of the elements which caus es unnecessary confusion and anxiety is  the holding pattern entry. Holding pattern entry procedures are not mandatory , they are merely a recommendation (as long as the airplane remains within the protected  airspace). The recommendation is based on three types of entries, depending on the sector from which the airplane arri ves at the holding fix. These are the direct, parallel and tear-dropentries.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding PatternsStandardholding  pattern -all turns made   to right.The inbound legof a holding pattern is 1 minuteat & below 14,000 ft. and 1.5  minutes above 14,000  ft.Outbound leg should be adjustedto yield a 1  minute inbound leg.Timing of the outbound leg should begin either abeam  the fix or after completing the outbound turn.Each holding pattern has a fix, a direction to hold FROM the fix, and an airway, bearing, course, radial, or route on which the aircraft is to hold.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding PatternsDME leg length may be used  instead of time  for holding  patterns.When used, DME leg length  refers to the  outbound leg  length.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding PatternsYou should triplethe crosswind  correction  needed on the  inbound leg to  determine the  outbound leg  heading.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Speed LimitsMaximum holding speeds are established to keep aircraft within the protected holding area during their one-minute (one-minute and a half above 14,000ft MSL) inbound and  outbound legs. Forcivil aircraft(notmilitary) in the United States, these airspeeds are:Up to 6,000ft MSL : 200 KIAS From 6,001 to 14,000ft MSL : 230 KIAS 14,001ft MSL and above: 265 KIASThe ICAO Maximum holding speeds  (international)Up to 14000ft: 230kts 14000ft to 20000ft: 240kts  20000ft to 34000ft: 265kts Above 34000ft: M0.83 With their higher performance characteristics, military aircrafthave higher holding speed  limits.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Adirectentryis performed exactly as it sounds: the aircraft flies directly to the holding fix, and immediately begins the first turn outbound.In aparallelentry, the aircraft flies to the holding fix, parallels the inbound course for one minute outbound, and then turns back, flies directly to the fix, and continues in the hold from there.In anoffsetorteardropentry, the aircraft flies to the holding fix, turns into the protected area, flies for one minute, and then turns back inbound, proceeds to the fix and continues from there.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbiVflkwyoQhttps://www.y outube.com/watch?v=47CTI7hzXX4Tutorial 1Tutorial 2 Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding ClearanceA holding clearance is give at least 5 minutes before arriving at  the clearance limit or fix. If the  holding pattern assigned by ATC is depicted on your aeronauticalc hart, you are expected to hold as published, UNLESS advised otherwise by ATC.  A holding clearance includes:ŁDirection from the fix  ŁName of the fix ŁCourse ŁLeg length  ŁIf appropriate, direction of tu rn if left turns are required ŁExpect further clearance time (i f you lose 2-way comm, the EFC  allows you to exit the holding pattern at a definite time  ŁPlan the last lap of the holding  patter to be at the fix as close as possible at the EFC time.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns ŒRECOMMENDED Entry ProceduresInstrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns -Entry Procedures Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns -Entry Procedures Note that outbound course falls into the direct sectorInstrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns -Entry Procedures Note that the outbound course falls into the teardrop (= tiny) sector.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Patterns -Entry Procedures Note that the outbound course falls into the parallel sector.Instrument  Ground School 2015 Holding Summary ChecklistŁA holding patter is a time delay used by ATC to help maintain separation and  smooth out the traffic flow.ŁYou may request a hold, for example, to wait for weather conditions to improve. ŁHolding pattern size is directly proportional to aircraft speed;doubling your speed  doubles the size of the holding pattern.ŁTurns are to the right in standard hol ding patterns, and to the left in nonstandard holding patters.ŁEach circuit of the holding pattern begins and ends at the holding fix. ŁAdjust the timing of you outbound leg to make your inbound leg one minute long. ŁTo correct for crosswind drift in the holding pattern, triple your inbound wind  correction angel on the outbound leg.ŁTo keep the volume of the protected airspace for a holding pattern within  reasonable limits, maximum holding airspeeds are designed according to altitude.ŁThe entry procedure for a holding pattern depends on your heading relative to the  holding course. The 3 recommended are direct, teardrop, and parallel.ŁA holding clearance should always contai n: holding direction, holding fix, and expect further clearance (EFC) time. If the holding pattern is not published, the clearance will also contain the holding course. For nonstandard patterns, left turns are specified. For patterns using DME, the clearance gives the outbound leg length in nautical miles.

Often,  performance monitoring will identify a need for  Boeing to assist in determining the solution to a  given in -service problem. However, with a good  understanding of the monitoring process and the  interactions among the variables involved, airlines  heir own problem  diagnosing and solving. Cruise performance monitoring has been used   for many years by airlines that strive to operate  their airplanes as ef˜ciently as possible.  These  airlines know that continuous cruise performance  monitoring of airplanes in their ˚eets can decrease  operating costs relative to airlines that do not   monitor airplane performance levels.  Continuous  cruise performance monitoring can give airlines  the information they need to:  A djust the baseline performance levels they  use for ˚ight planning and ˚ight management   computer (F MC ) fuel -required predictions   so that the correct amount of fuel is loaded   on each and every ˚ight.  I dentify normal deterioration for a ˚eet   of airplanes.  M atch the airplanes that perform best to   their longest routes.  I dentify high fuel burning airplanes for   possible maintenance.  Validate performance degradation for extended   twin -engine operations ( ETOP S) critical fuel  reserves planning (in lieu of the regulatory   requirement of 5  percent fuel mileage  deterioration allowance).  I ncrease ˚ight crew con˜dence in ˚ight plans  and possibly decrease the amount of  discretionary fuel requested and loaded. An additional, less recognized bene˜t of cruise  performance monitoring is diagnosing and solving  various airplane performance problems or issues.  These case studies show how cruise performance  monitoring was used to determine solutions to  three different problems. An airline that operates a 747 -400 airplane ˚eet  was concerned about what it considered to be   exce ssive fuel mileage deterioration relative to the  fuel mileage levels its airplanes exhibited when they   were new.  The airline requested help from both  Boeing and the engine manufacturer in dete rmining  what was causing this deterioration Š the   airframe, the engine, or both.  Through a better  understanding of the contributions that airframe  and engine deterioration make to the overall fuel  mileage deterioration, the airline could more  ef˜ciently focus its maintenance resources. To help resolve this issue, the airline proposed  an experiment involving an engine exchange  ˇ˙ ˛ :  Airframe versus engine Š   causes of fuel mileage deterioration ˇ˙ ˛ :  Airframe versus engine Š   causes of fuel mileage deterioration by Dave Anderson,  Flight Operations Engineer,  and Carolyn Hanreiter,  Aerodynamics Engineer 06 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 ﬁOLDﬂ 747-400 ﬁN EW ﬂ 747-400 TOTAL  FUEL MILEAGE  DIFF ERENCE 0.85%FROM OL D TO NE W AIRPLANE USING T HE OL D AN D NE W ENGINE Sbetween an old and a new airplane.  A six -year -old  747 -400, which was operating about 4.1  percent  below the ˚ight planning database level of fuel  mileage, represented the old airplane, while a  soon -to -be -delivered 747 -400 represented the  new one.  The airline requested assistance and  support from  Boeing and the engine manufacturer  in carrying out the experiment, which would:   M easure pre -exchange fuel mileage on both  the new and the old airplane (pre -engine swap).  Swap all four engines between the new and   old airplane.  M easure fuel mileage again on both the new  and the old airplane (post -engine swap). By using the same physical set of four engines  on two different airframes, the airline,  Boeing,   and the engine manufacturer agreed that any  measurable difference in fuel mileage for the same  set of engines on two different airframes could   be attributed to airframe effects alone Š that is,  drag deterioration. Boeing™s position was that proper maintenance  of the exterior of an airplane would lead to minimal  amounts of drag deterioration as an airplane ages.  As a result, the experiment began by putting the  old airplane through a complete D-check, including  a con˜guration inspection, so that it would be  considered as having a properly maintained  exterior before the engine swap.  Control surfaces  were rerigged, seals were repaired, and one engine  was replaced.  A minor leak in the pneumatic  system, discovered during the D-check, was not  ˜xed by the airline (determined to cause about a  0.1  percent penalty in fuel mileage). Fuel mileage  data was collected before and after the D-check to  determine any change across the check, especially  to quantify any changes resulting from rerigging  the ˚ight control surfaces and replacing any worn   seals. Fuel mileage improved 0.7  percent after the  D-check, with 0.3  percent attributed to proper  rerigging of the ˚ight controls and 0.4  percent  attributed to the changing of one engine. Fuel mileage data was then collected on   both the old and new airplanes before and   after the engine swap.  The data collected was   a combination of in -service data collected by   the airplane condition monitoring system ( ACM S)  and hand -recorded data that was collected under  more controlled test conditions. Average results from all four sets of data were  then compared to determine the differences in fuel  mileage between the old and new airplanes with  the same set of engines.  For both the old and new engines, the average  improvement in fuel mileage for the new airframe  relative to the old airframe was about 0.85  percent.  The initial conclusion could be that the older  airframe must contribute about 0.85  percent  toward the overall fuel mileage deterioration  originally observed on the old airplane and engine  combination. However, about 0.3  percent of that  difference is explainable.  Of the total calculated  difference of 0.85  percent, the pneumatic duct  leakage discovered on the old airplane during the   D-check contributed about 0.1  percent.  In addition,  the old airplane did not have the same revised   vertical ˜n fairing as the new 747 -400.  If the older  airplane had had the newer vertical ˜n fairing,   it is estimated that the fuel mileage would have   improved about 0.2  percent. After adjusting for the pneumatic system leak  and the newer vertical ˜n fairing, for the same set  of engines the old airplane™s fuel mileage averaged  about 0.5  percent worse than the new airplane.  The results are supportive of the position   that the drag deterioration of a well -maintained  airplane most likely will not exceed more than  about 0.5  percent. The experiment began by  putting the old airplane  through a complete  D-check, including a  conguration inspection.  07 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE NE W VERTICAL  FIN  FAIRING Œ 0.2% PNEUMATIC LEAKAGE Œ 0.1% ACTUAL UNEXPLAINABLE DIFF ERENCE = 0.55% Case Study 1:   To help determine the  primary cause of the fuel  mileage deterioration,  Boeing and the airline  collected fuel mileage data  on both a new and old  747-400 before and after  an engine exchange. An airline expressed concern to  Boeing that its  new 737 -800/ CFM56 -7B airplanes equipped with  Aviation  Partners  Boeing ( APB ) blended winglets  were exhibiting fuel mileage performance more than  2 percent worse than the  Boeing database level,  while its older, nonwinglet 737 -800s (all  approximately two years old) displayed fuel mileage  performance similar to the database level.  The  airline, which collects cruise fuel mileage data on an   ongoing basis, based its analysis on  ACM S-collected  cruise fuel mileage data analyzed using the  Boeing  Airplane  Performance  Monitoring ( APM ) program. In initial discussions between  Boeing and the  airline, it was explained that the database being used   by the airline to represent the 737 -800 with blended  winglets was based on the original winglet ˚ight test   results completed in early 2000.  This is the same  database used in the Flight  Crew  Operations  Manual,  the F MC , and the operational ˚ight planning  database.  Additional ˚ight tests had led to  Boeing™s  latest, best assessment of the delivered performance  of the winglets, which showed slightly less   improvement than the original testing.  This revised  database, based on several add itional ˚ight test  programs conducted in 2000 and 2001, includes a  different winglet drag increment (relative to a   nonwinglet 737 -800) and an aer oelastic correction  absent in the earlier database.  At  Mach  0.79, the difference between the two  databases varies from 0.2  percent to 2.3  percent,  depending on the exact conditions ˚own, with the  airline™s database predicting a better fuel mileage  increment because of the winglets in all cases.  Upon request, the airline provided  Boeing with  ACM S data for two of its 737 -800 airplanes with  blended winglets.  Boeing analyzed the data for  each airplane using both the operational database  and the revised database.  While the data was, on average, about  0.5  percent closer to the newer database level  than the operational database level,  Boeing™s  analysis did not agree with the airline™s analysis. Boeing™s analysis of the data using the revised  database concluded that two of the airplanes  appeared to display fuel mileage performance  about 3  percent below the latest  Boeing -assessed  winglet level Š even more than the 2  percent  originally suggested by the airline.  Further discussions with the airline revealed  that it had been using passenger weight allo wances  of 70 kg per passenger, including carry -on baggage,  and 13 kg per checked bag for all of its ˚ights.  As of June 1, 2002, the airline changed to the higher  passenger weight allowances recommended   in the Joint  Aviation  Requirements Œ  Operations  (J AR -OP S) 1.  Checked baggage would be weighed  whenever possible; otherwise, J AR -OP S 1 checked  baggage weight allowances would be used.  The  average passenger weight allowances are signi˜ -cantly higher than the 70 kg per passenger the   airline had been using.  Because the data sent   to  Boeing for the two winglet -equipped airplanes  was collected prior to June 2002, it was based   on the lighter weight allowance of 70 kg per  ˇ˙ ˛ :  Investigation of a cruise fuel  mileage shortfall ˇ˙ ˛ :  Investigation of a cruise fuel  mileage shortfall Boeing™s analysis of the  data using the revised  database concluded that  two of the airplanes  appeared to display fuel  mileage performance  about 3 percent below  the latest Boeing -assessed winglet   level Š even more than  the 2 percent originally  suggested by the airline.  08 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 passenger.  The airline™s analysis was based on  data using a combination of the weight allowances. As the investigation continued, the airline sent  additional data to  Boeing for the same two winglet -equipped airplanes Š but only for conditions  recorded after June 1, 2002, based on the higher  JAR -OP S weight allowances.  The airline also  included data for one more winglet -equipped  airplane, as well as for three nonwinglet airplanes.  The data for the two winglet -equipped airplanes  showed an immediate fuel mileage improvement   of about 2.4  percent for each airplane, based on  analyzing only the data from J AR -OP S weight  allowances collected after June 1, 2002.  This result  led quickly to the belief that the previous 70 kg per  passenger weight allowance was too light. Although both the fuel mileage and thrust  required changed signi˜cantly between data based  on 70 kg per passenger and data based on J AR -OP S passenger weight allowances, the thrust -speci˜c  fuel consumption ( TSF C) hardly changed.  Errors   in the estimated weight of an airplane present  themselves as high or low drag but do not affect the   fuel ˚ow (i.e.,  TSF C) deviations calculated by  APM .Although a signi˜cant improvement was  observed for both of the winglet -equipped airplanes  originally analyzed with data recorded before   June  1, 2002, the results for all six airplanes   were still not as good as what  Boeing experience  indicated for this model. Further investigation  determined that this airline operates its ˚eet of  737 -800s in a mix of both scheduled and holiday  charter ˚ights, using the speci˜c J AR -OP S weight  allowances called out for each.  The data sent to  Boeing for the six airplanes included a mixture of  data from both these types of ˚ights.  The average  passenger weight allowance recommended for  scheduled service is 84 kg per passenger and  76  kg per passenger for charter service (both are  higher than the 70 kg per passenger originally used   by the airline).  At  Boeing™s request, the airline  separated all of the post June 1, 2002, data into  two groups: charter service and scheduled service.   The data for each group was reanalyzed separately  (see ˜gs. 1 and 2).  The analysis revealed a signi˜cant discrepancy  in demonstrated fuel mileage and thrust -required  levels between the charter and scheduled ˚ights.   If airplane weight is underestimated, perceived  airplane performance will be poorer than expected.  Weight that is unaccounted for shows up as  increased airplane drag and decreased fuel   mileage.  In this analysis, the  TSF C deviations  remained consistent between both sets of data,  but the thrust -required (drag) deviations increased  signi˜cantly for the charter ˚ights Š a strong   indication of unaccounted -for airplane weight.  In this situation,  Boeing proposed that the  JAR -OP S passenger weight allowances as  recommended for holiday charter ˚ights were  underestimating the airplane weight for this particular  airline™s charter operations.  Although the airline  was receptive to the possibility that the J AR -OP S passenger weight allowances might be too light for its  holiday charter ˚ights, it was not fully convinced.  The  airline believed that the J AR -OP S weight allowances  for scheduled ˚ights could just as easily be incorrect,  in which case their airplanes were performing as  poorly as the charter ˚ight data indicated.  To determine which weight allowances were  correct, the airline and  Boeing agreed to collect  delivery ˚ight performance data on the airline™s   next new airplane delivery, a 737 -800 with  production blended winglets installed. The advantages of collecting delivery ˚ight   data as opposed to in -service data are:  T he performance level of the airplane could   be established at delivery.  T he airplane would be weighed at the  Boeing  factory with all the weight changes following  weighing but preceding delivery accurately  tracked and published in the Weight and  Balance  Manual.  Therefore, the delivery ˚ight  empty weight could be considered accurate.  Delivery ˚ights are ˚own with minimum crew,  so the issue of passenger weight allowances  would not exist. After collecting cruise performance data on   the delivery ˚ight, the airline would continue with  its standard in -service data collection on both  scheduled and charter ˚ights.  Comparing the  results from the delivery ˚ight with the results   obtained in -service would help determine which  JAR -OP S passenger weight allowances gave the  airline more accurate airplane gross weights.  If the  weight allowances were too heavy (the airplane was  actually lighter than estimated), then the in -service  performance would appear to be better than the   delivery ˚ight performance.  If the weight allowances  were too light (the airplane was heavier than   estimated), then the in -service performance would  appear to be worse than the delivery ˚ight level. The airline provided  Boeing with the ˜rst   10 weeks of  ACM S in -service data for the airplane  following delivery, separating the data for charter  ˚ights and scheduled -service ˚ights. For this  analysis, the data was analyzed relative to the   most recent 737 -800 with winglets database.  Although the delivery ˚ight results showed the  airplane to be slightly better than the demonstrated   database level, the early in -service charter ˚ight  results show the airplane with an average per -ceived fuel mileage 3.3  percent worse than the  demonstrated level (see ˜g. 3).  Unaccounted -for  weight shows up as airplane drag (thrust required).   According to the charter ˚ight data, the airplane  experienced a 4.4  percent increase in thrust  required on entering service, partially offset by a  0.7  percent drop in engine  TSF C, for a 3.6  percent  drop in fuel mileage from the delivery ˚ight level.   When the same ai rplane™s scheduled service data  for the same time period was analyzed, the fuel  mileage was much closer to the delivery ˚ight   level.  Average in -service fuel mileage for the ˜rst  10 weeks of operation deviated from the delivery   level by only 0.8  percent (only 0.5  percent below  the demonstrated level), which is within the  ACM S™s ability to determine fuel mileage over   a given time period. These results supported the conclusion that,  for this airline, the J AR -OP S passenger weight  allo wances for scheduled ˚ights more accurately  re˚ect the true weight of the passengers plus  carry -on baggage than the weight allowances  recommended for the charter ˚ights.  In addition, both are much more representative  than the original 70 kg per passenger the airline  had been using.  The weight allowances for  scheduled ˚ights of 84 kg per passenger produce  a more accurate zero fuel weight buildup and a  truer representation of the actual performance of  the airplane, with or without winglets. The results of this case study identi˜ed a  ˚eetwide airplane weight buildup issue for this   particular airline.  Boeing suggested that the  JAR -OP S holiday charter passenger weight  allowances appeared to be too light for this   airline™s operations, with unaccounted -for weight  showing up as excess airplane thrust required   (drag).  Using the J AR -OP S-recommended  passenger weight allowances for scheduled ˚ights,   the fuel mileage performance for its 737 -800s Š  with and without winglets Š is close to predicted  and re˚ects  Boeing expectations based on  numerous ˚ight tests and delivery ˚ight results.

The airline provided  ACM S-recorded data collected on each of the   14 airplanes, before and after the installation of   the winglets, to  Boeing for analysis and comment. Retro˜tting the winglets is a two -step process  comprising a structural reinforcement of the wing   followed by installation of the winglet.  Eleven of the  airplanes had the wing reinforcement completed  many weeks before the winglets were installed,  with the airplanes returning to service with the  reinforced wings. For these 11 airplanes, the  nonwinglet data was based on this reinforced wing   con˜guration.  Three of the airplanes had the wing  reinforced and winglet installed at the same time.  For these three airplanes, the nonwinglet data was   based on the production nonreinforced wing.  The  two sets of data were analyzed separately in order  to identify any differences in the improvement  based on differences in the baseline before the  winglets were installed. Boeing analyzed the data for all 14 airplanes  using the same in -house software tools used to  analyze  Boeing ˚ight -test data.  These software tools  are different from the  APM  software provided to  airline customers, but the analysis produces basically  the same results.  The main difference is that the  Boeing in -house software normalizes the data  points to nominal weight to pressure ratios (W  ) chosen by  Boeing while the  APM  software does not.  The improvements were plotted versus W    in order to illustrate that the magnitude of the  improvement depends on W   for a given  Mach  number.  This dependency on W   is because the  winglet improvement is a function of airplane lift  coef˜cient, which in turn is a function of weight,   altitude, and speed.  The improvements were  determined by comparing both the nonwinglet   and winglet fuel mileage results to the nonwinglet  737-800 database.  The performance improvement  because of the winglet is not the average winglet  deviation from the nonwinglet database; rather, it  ˇ˙ ˛ :  Performance improvement resulting from  737 -800 winglet retrot ˇ˙ ˛ :  Performance improvement resulting from   737 -800 winglet retrot DRA G IM PRO VEMENT RE SUL TING  FRO M  RETROF ITT ING 737-800   AIRP LANES  WITH  APB  BLENDED  WINGL ET S Figure 4 W/Ÿ 106 lb = Winglet installation plus  wing reinforcement relative  to baseline wing (based on in-service cruise  fuel mileage measurements  of three retro˜t airplanes)  = Winglet installation relative  to reinforced wing (based on in-service cruise  fuel mileage measurements  of eleven retro˜t airplanes)  = Predicted drag  improvement  (based on Boeing  ˚ight-test results) Boeing™s analysis of the  data indicated a slight  improvement in drag and  ed  weight) that resulted  from the reinforcement  of the wing structure.  11 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE 0.520.540.560.580.620.600.660.640.68Percent Change Fuel Mileage (+) GOOD  = Winglet installation plus  wing reinforcement relative  to baseline wing (based on in-service cruise  fuel mileage measurements  of three retro˜t airplanes)  = Winglet installation relative  to reinforced wing (based on in-service cruise  fuel mileage measurements  of eleven retro˜t airplanes)  = Predicted fuel mileage  improvement  (based on Boeing  ˚ight-test results) is the difference between the average deviations  for the winglet and nonwinglet, both measured  relative to the nonwinglet database.  This same  process was followed for each W  , and for the  various sets of data (see ˜gs. 4 and 5). Boeing™s analysis of the data indicated a slight  improvement in drag and fuel mileage (at a ˜xed  weight) that resulted from the reinforcement of the   wing structure.  The results indicated this improve -ment to be relatively small but still worth an   average of a few tenths of a  percentage at normal  cruise weights and altitudes.  Including the effects  of both the wing strengthening and the addition of   the winglets, the fuel mileage and drag improve -ments closely matched their predicted levels. Because the improvement in drag is a func -tion of W   for a given cruise speed, the actual  improvement in fuel mileage that the airline would  experience for any given ˚ight conditions depends  on the W  s ˚own during that airline™s operations.  The change in total fuel required to ˚y a given  route is determined by a combination of the  improvement in fuel mileage offset by any increase   in airplane weight.  Retro˜tting the winglets to the  737 -800, including wing reinforcement, currently  adds about 218 kg to the empty weight of the  airplane, and this additional weight alone would   increase fuel burn approximately 0.2  percent to  0.3  percent for an average 737 -800 ˚ight leg. An analysis similar to the  Boeing analysis   could have been carried out by the airline itself  using the spreadsheet output option from the   APM  software program.  The results of analyzing  the data in this manner would differ by only a  relatively small amount from the analysis carried  out using the  Boeing in -house software.  This same  method of analysis could be used to investigate  any type of modi˜cation to an airplane. Data  collected before and after a modi˜cation would   be compared to a reference database and the  difference between the two sets of data would  re˚ect the effect of the modi˜cation.  The bene˜ts of cruise performance monitoring   are well known by many airlines that include   the practice as part of their toolbox of practices  aimed at ef˜cient operation of their airplanes.   The three case studies in this article illustrate   the use of cruise performance monitoring to solve  various cruise performance issues.  Performance  monitoring can also be used to identify ˚ight plan -ning and F MC  performance factors and to monitor  perfo rmance deterioration trends.  Boeing has the  resources to assist airlines with cruise performance  monitoring analyses and to help them interpret  results.

Because airline  maintenance operations represent a  t, airlines have asked  Boeing for help in reducing this cost.  Recent results show that changing   the way service bulletins are prepared  and delivered Š combined with airline  process improvements Š can reduce  maintenance cosy and  improve the ability to show  conformance. Boeing has continually made enhancements to the content, format, and  delivery of its service bulletins.  Past enhancements include digital delivery,  simpli˜ed  English, and tabular work instructions. Boeing has been working directly with airlines to reduce end -to -end costs  for service bulletin incorporation. During this process, it was observed that  when airlines create their engineering orders, they rewrite or reengineer  service bulletins and rekit or repackage the kit of parts to match their own  engineering orders.  This reengineering causes unnecessary delays and  expense for the airlines in implementing service bulletins.  Boeing developed the ﬁ Enhanced Service  Bulletin,ﬂ also known as the  ﬁNext  Generation Service  Bulletin,ﬂ to minimize this reengineering effort while  making it easier and less expensive to implement service bulletins.  The  enhanced service bulletin, in conjunction with airline process improvements,  will enable a smooth work˚ow ensuring that information, parts, and tools are  staged in a coordinated manner to support the mechanic during service  bulletin incorporation. Boeing™s enhanced service bulletins incorporate four key features: lean  work instructions, faster access to essential information, improved kit  packaging, and selective information extraction.  These features have been  incrementally introduced into  Boeing service bulletins as they became  available beginning in mid 2003.  Today,  Boeing develops all new service  bulletins to encompass all four features whenever possible.

Lean work  instructions One of the most apparent changes in the enhanced service bulletin is that  ˜gure instructions are provided in a work breakdown of four hours or fewer.  This makes it possible for airlines to schedule mechanics™ time more  ef˜ciently and reduces the coordination dif˜culties associated with work   shift changeover. Each ˜gure in the enhanced service bulletin is a single con˜guration.  Previously, multiple con˜gurations were typically shown in a ˜gure.  This  required the airline engineer, planner, or mechanic to extract the steps  applicable to the speci˜c airplane.  One con˜guration per ˜gure simpli˜es  extraction of the applicable data and can prevent accomplishment of the  wrong steps.  Additionally, separate left and right side ˜gures are now  provided, which further facilitates extraction of the applicable data.  03. Improved  kit packaging Enhanced service bulletin kits are packaged to match the ˜gure instructions.  If operators use the service bulletin instructions as written, this new packaging  eliminates additional repackaging or sorting through parts.  This change alone  can result in a signi˜cant time savings in both the operations and  maintenance arenas.  04.  Selective information  extraction Enhanced service bulletins enable airline personnel to extract information  speci˜c to selected airplane con˜gurations.  This allows an airline to more  quickly identify and extract service bulletin information speci˜c to its airplane  con˜guration.  Once the data is extracted, it can easily be copied into an  airline™s own document management system. 02. Faster access to  essential information When viewed online,  Boeing™s enhanced service bulletins include hotlinks  within their text that provide direct access to referenced documents, making it  easier and faster to ˜nd the information needed. For example, hotlinks provide   quick access to relevant information in the  Airplane  Maintenance  Manual  (AMM ), Structural  Repair  Manual (S RM ), and other documents available on   the Web portal  MyBoeingFleet.com. 14 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 ONE CON FIGURATION PER  FIGURE PRO VIDES DIRECT ACCE SS  TO APPLICABLE  DATA.

Boeing worked with airlines to validate the bene˜ts of the enhanced service  bulletin.  As part of that effort,  Boeing coordinated closely with one airline to  study the predicted bene˜ts of the enhanced service bulletin. Study data from  the airline showed these predicted bene˜ts:  A  potential 60  percent reduction in defects attributed to the rewriting or  reengineering of the service bulletin data into the airline™s document  management system.  A  potential 77  percent reduction in labor hours to develop and release the  service bulletin data into the airline™s document management system. Based on the positive results of the study data,  Boeing continued to work  closely with the same airline to collect actual labor hour bene˜ts.  The actual  data was obtained by comparing airline incorporation of a conventional ser -vice bulletin on part of its ˚eet and an enhanced version of the same service  bulletin on the remainder of its ˚eet. Data from the airline showed these  actual results:   A  reduction in nonrecurring engineering labor hours to develop the airline™s  own engineering and job cards from 143 labor hours to 87 labor hours.  A  reduction in recurring kit packaging labor hours from 24 hours to   6 hours per airplane. To date,  Boeing has issued more than 1,300 service bulletins across all  Boeing model airplanes with one or more of the four key features described  above.  Boeing has been working with a number of airlines to assist in the  adoption and implementation of enhanced service bulletins into their operations  as well as to obtain airline user feedback. Such feedback is key to adding  improvements to the enhanced service bulletins.  Boeing understands that each airline™s maintenance operation is unique and is  willing to work with individual airlines to ensure that each leverages all of the  bene˜ts possible from enhanced service bulletins and that the bulletins ˜t well  with existing airline operations.  Airlines may contact their  Boeing Field Service  Representative for assistance in adopting enhanced service bulletins.

As a result   of this approach, the basic 787 -8 airplane will have 30  percent  lower airframe maintenance costs than any comparable product  and will be available for revenue service more often than any  other commercial airplane. The  Boeing 787 program has consciously  designed in new, state -of -the -art features and  performance that reduce cost and increase  airplane availability.  These features will lead to  additional savings and greater revenue for  Boeing  customers.  The 787 re˚ects a new life -cycle  design philosophy that has dictated some  signi˜cant changes in the way the airplane will be   built.  These changes include extensive use of  composites in the airframe and primary structure,  an electric systems architecture, a reliable and  maintainable design, and an improved  maintenance program.  Taken together, these  changes will offer customers a guaranteed  reduction in maintenance costs.  The life -cycle cost approach to design looks at the  total cost picture for design options by examining  all of the factors that affect an airplane over its  lifetime.  Traditionally, the value of a given design  solution has been measured using factors such as:   Drag  Weight  N oise (cabin and community)  Schedule reliability  Development cost  B uild cost Using these measures to compare design  options helps determine the optimum choice. With the 787,  Boeing has expanded the life -cycle design approach by adding two unique  performance measures: maintenance cost and   airplane availability.  Clearly, looking at the cost to  maintain systems over their lifetimes becomes a  signi˜cant factor when attempting to understand   the total effect of a design decision on an operator™s  cost structure.  Airplane availability includes not  only schedule reliability but also other factors such   as the length of time an airplane must be out -of -service when maintenance is required.  Obviously,  taking an airplane out of service for two days has a  much bigger effect on operator revenue than  taking it out of service for two hours.  ˜˘ -ˇˇ ˜ ˇ˚ ˘ˆ ˘ ˜˚˚ ˜˘ -ˇˇ ˜ ˇ˚ ˘ˆ ˘ ˜˚˚ Boeing 787 from the  Ground  Upby Justin Hale,  787 Deputy Chief  Mechanic 18 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 Advanced CompositesAluminumTitaniumSteel (primarily landing gear) 50%Other20%15%5%10%The  Boeing 787 makes greater use of composite  materials in its airframe and primary structure than  any previous  Boeing commercial airplane.  Under -taking the design process without preconceived  ideas enabled  Boeing engineers to specify the  optimum material for speci˜c applications  throughout the airframe.  The result is an airframe comprising nearly   half carbon ˜ber reinforced plastic and other   composites.  This approach offers weight savings  on average of 20  percent compared to more  conventional aluminum designs. Selecting the optimum material for a speci˜c  application meant analyzing every area of the  airframe to determine the best material, given the  operating environment and loads that a component  experiences over the life of the airframe. For  example, aluminum is sensitive to tension loads but  handles compression very well.  On the other hand,  composites are not as ef˜cient in dealing with  compression loads but are excellent at handling   tension.  The expanded use of composites, especially  in the highly tension -loaded environment of the  fuselage, greatly reduces maintenance due to fatigue   when compared with an aluminum structure.  This  type of analysis has resulted in an increased use  of titanium as well. Where loading indicates metal  is a preferred material system but environmental  considerations indicate aluminum is a poor choice,   titanium is an excellent low -maintenance design  solution.  Titanium can withstand comparable loads  better than aluminum, has minimal fatigue con -cerns, and is highly resistant to corrosion.  Titanium  use has been expanded on the 787 to roughly   14  percent of the total airframe.  Every structural  element of the 787 has undergone this type of life -cycle analysis and material types are based on a  thorough and disciplined selection process.  ˇ˚˝˚˘ ˘ˆ  ˙˘˙ ˝ ˙ˆ  ˘ ˝˙ ˛ˇ˛ ˇ˚˝˚˘ ˘ˆ  ˙˘˙ ˝ ˙ˆ  ˘ ˝˙ ˛ˇ˛ HOW  CO MPO SI TE  S OLU TIONS  ARE   APP LI ED  THRO UG HO UT THE  787 In addition to using a robust structural design   in damage-prone areas, the 787 has been designed  with the capability to be repaired in exactly the   same manner that airlines would repair an airplane  today Š with bolted repairs. These can be just as  permanent and damage tolerant as they are on   a metal structure.  19 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE In addition to lowering the overall airplane  weight, moving to a composite primary structure  promises to reduce both the scheduled and  nonroutine maintenance burden on the airlines. Reduced scheduled maintenance.  Exper ience  with the  Boeing 777 proves that composite stru ctures  require less scheduled maintenance than noncom -posite structures. For example, the 777 composite  tail is 25  percent larger than the 767™s aluminum  tail, yet requires 35  percent fewer scheduled  maintenance labor hours.  This labor hour reduction  is due to the result of a reduced risk of corrosion  and fatigue of composites compared with metal. Reduced nonroutine maintenance.  A com -posite structure also results in less nonroutine   maintenance.  The 777 ˚oor structure is all  composite and highlights the advantages of   this material when applied in a harsh environ -ment.  Airline operators are aware of the fatigue  cracking and corrosion dif˜culties experienced  with traditional aluminum ˚oor beams.  The 777  model has been ˚ying for more than 10 years with  more than 565 airplanes in the ˚eet and to date  has not replaced a single composite ˚oor beam.  Boeing has also implemented a rigorous  process for evaluating the use of aluminum that  combines likelihood of corrosion with consequence   of corrosion.  This scoring system provides a  de˜nitive measure for establishing acceptable  application of aluminum in the design with full  understanding of the maintenance implications. Corrosion and fatigue in a structure add  signi˜cantly to the nonroutine maintenance burden   on an operator.  Nonroutine maintenance frequently  doubles or even triples the total labor hours  expended during a maintenance check. With   the expanded use of composites and titanium  combined with greater discipline in usage   of aluminum,  Boeing expects the 787 to have  much lower nonroutine labor costs than a more  conventional metallic airframe. In addition to using a robust structural design  in damage -prone areas, such as passenger and  cargo doors, the 787 has been designed from the  start with the capability to be repaired in exactly  the same manner that airlines would repair an  airplane today Š with bolted repairs.  The ability to  perform bolted repairs in composite structure is  service -proven on the 777 and offers comparable  repair times and skills as employed on metallic   airplanes. ( By design, bolted repairs in composite  structure can be permanent and damage tolerant,  just as they can be on a metal structure.) In addition, airlines have the option to perform  bonded composite repairs, which offer improved   aerodynamic and aesthetic ˜nish.  These repairs  are permanent, damage tolerant, and do not  require an autoclave. While a typical bonded   repair may require 24 or more hours of airplane   downtime,  Boeing has taken advantage of the  properties of composites to develop a new line of  maintenance repair capability that requires less  The right material for the   right application.  Without  preconceived ideas, Boeing  engineers were able   to specify the optimum  material for speci˜c  applications throughout   the airframe. 20 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 than an hour to apply.  This rapid composite repair  technique offers temporary repair capability to get  an airplane ˚ying again quickly, despite minor  damage that might ground an aluminum airplane.  In total, the reduced risk of corrosion and fatigue  associated with composites combined with the com -posite repair techniques described will lower overall  maintenance costs and maximize airline revenue by  keeping airplanes ˚ying as much as possible.  The  Boeing 787 re˚ects a completely new  approach to onboard systems. Virtually everything  that has traditionally been powered by bleed -air  from the engines has been transitioned to an  electric architecture.  The affected systems include:  E ngine start  A uxiliary power unit ( APU ) start  Wing ice protection  C abin pressurization  Hydraulic pumps The only remaining bleed system on the 787   is the anti -ice system for the engine inlets.  While much can be said regarding the ef˜ciency  gains achieved by changing the means of extracting  power for airplane systems from the engines, the  787™s no -bleed architecture brings with it some sig -ni˜cant maintenance cost and reliability advantages   as well.  By eliminating the pneumatic systems from  the airplane, the 787 will realize a notable reduction  in the mechanical complexity of airplane systems.  The list below highlights just a few of the compo -nents eliminated as a result of this systems change:  P neumatic engine and  APU  start motors  APU  load compressor   P recoolers  Various ducts, valves, and air control systems  L eak and overheat detection systems Auxiliary power unit.  The  APU  provides an  excellent illustration of the be ne˜ts of the more -electric architecture.  One of the primary functions  of a conventional  APU  is driving a large pneumatic  load compressor.  Replacing the pneumatic load  compressor with starter generators results in  signi˜cantly improved start reliability and power  availability.  The use of starter generators reduces  maintenance requirements and increases reliability  due to the simpler design and lower parts count.   In terms of in˚ight start reliability, the 787  APU   is expected to be approximately four times more   reliable than conventional  APU s with a pneumatic  load compressor. Electrical power generation.  Another funda -me ntal architectural change on the 787 is the use  of variable frequency electrical power and the  integration of the engine generator and starter  functions into a single unit.  This change enables  elimination of the constant speed drive (also known  as the integrated drive generator,  IDG), greatly  reducing the complexity of the generator.  In addi -tion, by using the engine generator as the starter  motor (an approach used with great success on the   Next -G eneration 737  APU ), the 787 has been able  to eliminate the pneumatic starter from the engine.  ˆ˚-˜,  ˝˚  ˜ˇ˘ˇ   ˝ ˙ˇ˘ˇ˛ ˆ˚-˜,  ˝˚  ˜ˇ˘ˇ   ˝ ˙ˇ˘ˇ˛ NO BLEED / MORE ELECTRICARCHITECTUREBLEE D-AIR  POWERE DThe transition from  bleed -air power to an  electric architecture  reduces the mechanical  complexity of the 787.

Brakes.  One innovative application of the more -electric systems architecture on the 787 is the  move from hydraulically actuated brakes to  electric.  Electric brakes signi˜cantly reduce the  mechanical complexity of the braking system and  eliminate the potential for delays associated with  leaking brake hydraulic ˚uid, leaking valves, and  other hydraulic failures.  Because its electric brake  systems are modular (four independent brake  actuators per wheel), the 787 will be able to  dispatch with one electric brake actuator ( EBA ) inoperative per wheel and will have signi˜cantly  reduced performance penalties compared with  dispatch of a hydraulic brake system with a failure  present.  The  EBA  is line -replaceable enabling  in-situ maintenance of the brakes.  In general, electric systems are much easier   to monitor for health and system status than  hydraulic or pneumatic systems; the brakes take   full advantage of this.  Continuous onboard  monitoring of the brakes provides airlines with a  number of advantages, such as:  Fault detection and isolation  E lectrical monitoring of brake wear  A bility to eliminate scheduled visual brake   wear inspections  E xtended parking times Because the 787 brakes can monitor the  braking force applied even while parked, the  electric brakes enable extended parking brake  times by monitoring and automatically adjusting   its parking brakes as the brakes cool. At an airplane level, the reduction in   systems parts by moving to a primarily electric   architecture is signi˜cant.  Overall, the 787 will  reduce mechanical systems complexity by more   than 50  percent compared to a 767; elimination   of pneumatic systems is a major contributor.   As a consequence of this reduction in complexity,  airlines will experience reduced airplane -level  maintenance costs and improved airplane -level  dispatch reliability. In fact, the move to electric systems is expected  to cut about a third of the schedule interrupts com -pared to a 767 for the systems affected by the  no -bleed/more -electric architecture.  Other bene˜ts  include improved health monitoring, greater fault   tolerance, and better potential for future tech -nology improvements. In addition to major changes such as use of com -posites and the elimination of pneumatic systems,  the 787 takes advantage of new technologies to  increase reliability and improve maintainability.  Boeing has looked for opportunities large and  small to reduce maintenance costs while making  the 787 highly available for revenue service. Here are some wide -ranging examples that  illustrate the extent of these improvements. Advanced maintainability analysis.  A new  generation of digital analysis tools is enabling   Boeing to better understand future maintenance  issues during the design process.

Boeing has already identi˜ed about  4,000 areas of maintenance on the airplane   and will both digitally and physically validate   100  percent of 787 maintenance procedures   prior to entry into service ( EI S). Advanced maintenance computing  systems.  The 787 features greatly expanded and  improved systems monitoring capability coupled  with an advanced onboard maintenance computing  system.  This capability combined with e -enabling  technologies, which make real -time ground -based  monitoring possible, will signi˜cantly aid in rapid,   accurate troubleshooting of the 787.  Airplane  systems information used in conjunction with fully  integrated support products will help maintenance  and engineering organizations quickly isolate    failed components and reduce return -to -service  times.  Boeing expects the 787 to show a reduction  in no -fault -found ( NFF) removals of 58  percent  compared to the 767, reducing yet another major  cost driver for 787 operators. Selective paint stripping.  Boeing is pioneering a  new paint stripping technique that makes it possible  to chemically strip the paint on the airplane™s   composite airframe.  A three -hour chemical strip  removes decorative paint.  This eliminates the  hand -sanding requirement for paint removal on  composite structure and puts the 787 on par with  a metal airplane in terms of repaint times. Electro -chromatic dimmable windows.   The 787 replaces mechanical window shades   with highly reliable electro -chromatic dimmable  windows with a projected life of more than  20  years.  In addition to eliminating the  maintenance associated with light -leaking or  inoperable window shades, electro -chromatic  dimmable windows give cabin crews the ability to  dim or brighten an entire cabin at the press of a  single button.  Propulsion structure and airplane interface.   The 787 marks the ˜rst time  Boeing has made the  engine type interchangeable at the wings.  That  allows a 787 owner to quickly and easily convert  an airplane to a different engine brand in order to  place it into a ˚eet.  The 787 engine cowlings have  a quick composite repair capability, enabling small  damages to be repaired in one hour at the gate,  maximizing the airplane™s availability. High -intensity discharge (HID) and light  emitting diode (LED) lighting.  The 787  has replaced virtually all cabin, ˚ight deck and   exterior lighting with H ID and  LE D lighting technolo -gies.  Because these light types have no ˜lament,  the operational life of the lights is dramatically  longer than that of an incandescent bulb.

In the 787,  Boeing is demonstrating that generational  improvements in systems technology result in   airplane -wide reliability improvements.  At an  airplane level, component reliability is improved by   more than 15  percent when compared to the 767.  That translates into improved schedule reliability.  The 787 program is targeting a mature schedule  reliability of more than 99  percent. By working closely with airlines, major partners  and suppliers, and regulatory agencies,  Boeing  plans to deliver a scheduled maintenance program  approved by the  U.S. Federal  Aviation  Administra -tion and  European  Aviation Safety  Agency before  taking the 787 into ˚ight testing.  The 787 program  has set target intervals for  EI S that exceed those of  any other commercial airplane.  These target  intervals include a ˜rst external visual inspection of  the structure at 6 years and the ˜rst internal visual  inspection of the structure (heavy check) at 12   years.  The 787 maintenance program is on track  to deliver the target intervals at  EI S.  In addition to longer intervals between  scheduled maintenance checks, the 787 program  projects labor hours content will be reduced by   20  percent on a per -check basis and total scheduled  labor hours will be reduced by 60  percent over the  life of the airplane.  This reduction in required scheduled  maintenance is another signi˜cant contributor   to the overall 30  percent airframe and systems  maintenance cost reduction guaranteed by the 787. By designing the 787 with features and  performance that reduce cost and increase   airplane availability,  Boeing is developing an  airplane that promises to offer  Boeing customers  signi˜cant savings and greater revenue.

Boeing expects the 787 to  show a reduction in NFF removals of 58 percent compared to the  767, reducing yet another major cost driver for 787 operators.  24 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 BOEING  W OR KS W IT H THE IN DUSTR Y  TO  ENSURE  THAT  SC HED-ULE D  MAINTENANCE  PROGRAMS  MEET  THE HIG HEST  STAN DAR DS.Maintenance Program Enhancements by Brian  McLoughlin,   Maintenance Engineering Technical  Services  Manager,  and Jane Beck, 777  IS C Co-Chair 25 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE Boeing regularly works with an Industry Steering Committee to improve   the efciency of the maintenance tasks that operators use to create their  scheduled maintenance programs for their commercial airplane models.   These improvements optimize the content and interval of maintenance   tasks to maintain safety and reliability and achieve cos Improvements are based on Boeing analysis of in -service data collected from  the wort. All improvements are reviewed and approved through   an industry process involving Boeing, operators, and regulatory agencies. Over the decades,  Boeing has worked closely with the aviation industry to  develop robust processes that ensure scheduled maintenance programs  adhere to the highest safety and operational reliability levels.  In creating   and updating its scheduled maintenance programs,  Boeing uses a process   as outlined in Federal  Aviation  Administration  Advisory  Circular 121 -22 A (Maintenance  Review  Board  Procedures) that involves the establishment of   an  Industry Steering  Committee ( ISC), in -service data collection and analysis,  and a recommendation from  Boeing for each individual task under review. An  ISC comprises operators, manufacturers, and regulators who follow the  guidance outlined in  Advisory  Circular  AC  121-22 A to develop the scheduled  maintenance program for an airplane model and the resulting  Maintenance  Review  Board  Report ( MRBR ).  It is the function of the  ISC, under the direction  of a chairperson (an operator selected by its peer operators), to develop and   establish policy for the development of the  MRBR  proposal and participate in  the review and approval process of the  ISC.  ISC meetings for all models, which are held on an as -needed basis, take  place in Seattle, Wash., or  Long  Beach,  Calif., and generally last one week.  Meetings are open to all operators and typically cover a speci˜c  Boeing  airplane model or de˜ned set of models.  The airframe manufacturer serves as an  ISC co -chairperson and has   the duties of receiving in -service data to be analyzed for proposed  MRBR  changes, providing the  ISC with suf˜cient technical data to base decisions   on proposed changes, providing relevant training to the  ISC as needed, and  coordinating and participating in  ISC and working group activities.  The Federal  Aviation  Agency (F AA ) and  European  Aviation Safety  Agency  (EA SA) have  Maintenance  Review  Board ( MRB ) chairperson duties, which  consist of inviting other regulatory authorities, in coordination with the  manufacturer, to participate in the  MRB  process; reviewing and accepting   or rejecting the policy and procedures used throughout the process; and  providing ˜nal acceptance of the  MRBR .  The  ISC makes ongoing improvements to the scheduled maintenance  program using the most current maintenance philosophy (see ﬁHistory of  Main -tenanceﬂ on p. 28).  These improvements not only maintain the inherent safety  and reliability of the airplane but can also produce substantial savings for the  operators.  Any operator may become a representative voting member of an  ISC.  Operators strongly in˚uence the success of a scheduled maintenance  program revision by providing in -service data.  Boeing analyzes the ˚eetwide  data provided by the operators to identify important trends for incorporation   into the scheduled maintenance programs through the  ISC process.  The operators and  Boeing work together to identify areas within the  scheduled maintenance program to review for optimization.  In-service data   is collected by the operators and sent to  Boeing for review and analysis. For  each identi˜ed maintenance task,  Boeing reviews the data and analyzes the  positive and negative in -service results.  Boeing also reviews service bulletins,  reliability data, service letters, airworthiness directives and any other pertinent   documents, and coordinates proposed changes with other  Boeing or supplier  engineering groups.  Once the analysis is complete,  Boeing makes a recommendation for each  individual task under review and presents it to the  ISC- participating operators  and the regulatory agencies.  Each operator is entitled to one vote on the  Boeing proposal.  The entire process is observed by the regulatory agencies,  which ultimately can approve or reject any proposed changes.  Accepted  changes are incorporated into the  MRBR , requiring acceptance from the  MRB  chairperson (the F AA  and  EA SA).  The changes are also incorporated into the  Boeing  Maintenance  Planning Data ( MP D) document and  Boeing -con˜gured  task cards, which are issued to the operators for inclusion in their own  scheduled maintenance programs. The  ISC process (see ˜g. 1) ensures that operators have ef˜cient scheduled  maintenance programs with the highest possible levels of safety and reliability.  The combination of operators™ experience and  Boeing™s design -based analysis  ensures that all safety items on the airplane are supported by scheduled   maintenance tasks with appropriate intervals.  The result is increased reliability  with decreased labor hours and maint enance costs (see ˜g. 2).  Boeing  engineering design groups can develop resolutions to technical issues arising   from the in -service data.  The new design or process changes can improve  reliability and result in maintenance cost avoidance for the entire ˚eet. ˘ˆ˛  ˘ˆ  ˇ˚˝˝ ˘ ˘ˆ˛  ˘ˆ  ˇ˚˝˝ ˘ ˘ˆ-˘ˇ ˙˙ ˇ˚ ˜˜ ˇ˘˚ˆ ˙ˆ ˙ˆ˙ ˜˘ ˘ˆ-˘ˇ ˙˙ ˇ˚ ˜˜ ˇ˘˚ˆ ˙ˆ ˙ˆ˙ ˜˘ 26 AERO QUARTERLY    QTR_04 | 06 INDUS TR Y  STEER ING   CO MMI TTEE  PROCE SS Figure 1 INDUSTRY  S TEERIN G COMMITTEE Boeing /  Airlines / F AA  /  EA SA Review Data  for  Acceptance MRBR  Acceptance   by FAA  /  EA SABoeing  MP DIssuance   Generated Incorporation in  Operator  Maintenance Program Boeing  Recommendation to  ISCData  Analysis by  Boeing In-Service  Airline Maintenance  Data  Collection Engineering Enhancements In-Service Operators 27 BOEING.COM/COMMERCIAL/AEROMAGAZINE 777  TECH NI CA L DIS PATCH  RE LI AB ILI TY AND S CHED UL ED  MAIN TE NANCE   LABOR  HO URS Figure 2 Reduction in scheduled  maintenance cost has had  no adverse effect on tech -nical dispatch reliability. 2,5500™96™01™06100%97.9%         =Scheduled Maintenance Labor Hours per 10,000  Flight Hours =777 TechnicalDispatch ReliabilityA recent evaluation of the scheduled maintenance program for the 777  illustrates the  ISC process.  This evaluation included a review of approximately  400 777 maintenance tasks.  The new program extends the maintenance inspection interval for zonal and  structural tasks, involving such areas as doors, fuselage compartments, struts,  and ˚ight controls, from 25 to 37 months.  Under the previous  MRBR , an airplane  was pulled out of service for approximately 5 days to perform required mainte -nance checks every 25 months.  The addition of 12 months to this maintenance  interval provides signi˜cant ˜nancial and scheduling opportunities to 777 opera -tors.  Other tasks that have been escalated in the new maintenance program  include many general inspections, which have increased from 100 to 125 days. The result saves more than 400 labor -hours per airplane per year and  increases airplane availability by providing airlines with one additional day of   revenue operation annually for each 777 in their ˚eet.  Using industry averages,  the reduced maintenance costs and increased revenue opportunities added   more than $100,000  USD in annual value to each 777 in operation.  In total, the evaluation resulted in an escalation (i.e., lengthening of   the interval between maintenance task accomplishment) of approximately   100 line maintenance phase check tasks (similar in content to the block  program  A- check) and approximately 250 hangar -level -check tasks (similar   in content to the block program  C- check).  The  ISC, however, did not escalate  approximately 12  percent of the tasks reviewed and de -escalated (i.e., short -ened the interval between maintenance task accomplishment) one task based  on the ˜ndings from the in -service data.  For example, one task that was escalated on the 777 was ﬁoperationally  check ˚ight deck indicator lights in dim and bright mode,ﬂ which is considered  an economic, not a safety, task.  Operators provided 1,500 test results for this  task with no adverse ˜ndings, and the  ISC determined that the interval for   this task could be extended from 1,200 to 1,500 ˚ight hours.  As with the  other tasks that were escalated, this change enables operators to arrange their  maintenance programs in a more ef˜cient manner without compromising safety. Boeing continues to seek optimization of its maintenance requirements using  improved data collection and the  ISC processes.  Boeing is currently developing  a program that collects and stores real -time in -service data from scheduled  maintenance visits in a line and hangar environment and ass ociates this   data with the scheduled maintenance task.  The program enables data to be  gathered and analyzed centrally for use by the industry in adjusting current  scheduled maintenance tasks or check intervals based on in -service ˜ndings. This will allow  ISCs to be more proactive in managing scheduled maintenance  programs.  It also will allow operators to benchmark against other participating  operators, expedite ground times for line and hangar maintenance visits, and plan  spares and consumables using worldwide averages for scheduled maintenance. The  ISC process maintains safety and reliability standards and reduces waste  by ensuring maintenance tasks are performed at the proper level of intensity  and interval, based on industry in -service ˚ight data and each airplane  model™s inherent design characteristics. Data collection and operator participation in the  ISC process remain key  factors in future scheduled maintenance program improvements.

The  programs were simple and without analytical  basis.  The formation of airlines created the need  for new regulations and broader regulatory  involvement in maintenance requirements. With the entry of large jet airplanes into the  commercial market in the 1950s, the airplane  manufacturer became the source of maintenance  program development.  The underlying concept was  to overhaul every component at a given time. In 1960, the industry formed a task force to  investigate the capabilities of preventive main -tenance.  The ˜ndings of the task force led to a  new type of maintenance called ﬁon -conditionﬂ  maintenance. The handbook ﬁ Maintenance  Evaluation   and  Program Development,ﬂ also referred to as  ﬁMSG- 1,ﬂ was developed in 1968 for the 747 by  the  Air  Transport  Association ( ATA )  Maintenance  Steering  Group ( MSG), a group of airframe  manufacturers, airlines,  U.S. Federal  Aviation  Administration (F AA ) repr esentatives, and  suppliers.  MSG- 1 used decision logic to develop  scheduled maintenance.  For aircraft in the 1970s, the document  ﬁAirline/ Manufacturer  Maintenance  Program  Planning,ﬂ or ﬁ MSG- 2,ﬂ was developed.  It was  process oriented and analyzed failure modes   from the part level up.  The  MSG- 2 philosophy   was based on the theory that all airplanes and  their components reach a period when they should  be ﬁzero timedﬂ or ﬁoverhauledﬂ and restored to  new condition.  In 1978,  United  Airlines, commissioned by the  Department of Defense, developed a methodology  for designing maintenance programs based on   tested and proven airline practices.  This new  methodology was the basis for  MSG- 3, the current  industry standard.  This methodology has a task -oriented  approach to maintenance that analyzes system  failure modes from a system level, or top down.  Maintenance tasks are performed for safety, oper -ational, or economic reasons.  They involve both  preventive maintenance and failure ˜nding tasks.  Revisions to the  MSG- 3 philosophy have  provided added methodology for improving  coverage of all modes of failure, such as inclusion  of the  Corrosion  Prevention and  Control  Program,  Enhanced  Zonal  Analysis, and  Lightning/High  Intensity  Radiated Fields.  Boeing continues to work with airplane  operators, regulators, and the  ATA  to update   MSG- 3 to enhance the methodology.  history of  maintenance11.25\" Bleed 8.75\" Bleed 11\" Trim 8.5\" Trim Scale: 1.0\" = 1\" 10.5\" Live 8\" Live Date:6/20/06le Name: BOEG_BCAG_787_4453M_MOutput printed at: 100%Fonts:Helvetica (Bold), Helvetica (Plain), Agenda Light Media:Aero Boeing Space/Color: Live:8 in. x 10.5 in.

Celestial navigation will now be a way of life for you.  The phe-  nomenal accuracy of GPS, along with the KLN 89(B)Õs user-friendly operation and graphics display will make flying a delight.  Not only will the KLN 89(B) help you to navigate more easily and more accurately, its trip planning features, air data calculations, and other useful fea- tures will make you feel like youÕre flying with a true flight management system.In addition, KLN 89B may be IFR approved for En route, Terminal,and Non-precision Approach operations.  We think youÕll find that  having an abundance of navigational data (not to mention a moving map!) available to you will make non-precision approaches more pre- cise and more enjoyable.This Pilot\\'s Guide will be of great help to you.  It is written in plain, simple English and it assumes you are not an experienced user of GPS or other type of long range navigation equipment.  If you are  experienced, so much the better.  This Pilot\\'s Guide also includes  hundreds of sample screen figures and other illustrations to make your learning easier.  It is designed so that you can start at the front  and progress in the order presented; however, you may want to skip around and learn things in your own order.  Also, on page iv, there is  an index of frequently used procedures which will help you find the page that describes how to do exactly what you want to do.  There  are also several appendices in the back of the manual that you may find useful from time to time.Be sure to keep this Pilot\\'s Guide handy with you in the airplane.  It is designed to fit easily in the glove box, or in the seat pocket.  The KLN  89(B) is very simple to operate, but the Pilot\\'s Guide can sure be of help to you.One last thing.  Don\\'t get so involved in learning to use the KLN 89(B)that you forget to fly the airplane. Be careful, and remember to keep a close eye out for other aircraft.KLN 89(B) SNEAK PREVIEWIf you absolutely canÕt wait to use your KLN 89(B) until youÕve readthis PilotÕs Guide, this section is for you.  This page will teach you just  enough to get going and then learn by doing.  This operational pre-  view assumes the KLN 89(B) has been properly installed, the unit  was previously operational in the same general geographical loca-  tion, and that no peripheral equipment interfaced with the KLN 89(B) (such as external HSIs, CDIs, autopilots, moving map display, etc.) is to be used at this time.  If you are using this operational preview in  flight, do so only in good VFR conditions and only with an alternate means of navigation (including pilotage) available to cross-check position.1.Turn the unit on with the On/Off knob (the small knob in lower left hand corner).2.For a few seconds, the Power On Page is displayed while the unit runs a self-test. Afterwards, the Self-test Page is displayed. If the KLN 89(B) is receiving an altitude from an encoding altime- ter, the present indicated altitude will be displayed on line 2. The bottom line should display Passand a flashing Ok?. Press thebutton to approve the Self-test Page.3.The Initialization Page will now be displayed.  If the date and time are incorrect by more than 10 minutes, refer to section 3.2 of this PilotÕs Guide. The right side of the screen should show the identi- fier of the nearest airport to the initial position, along with a radial and distance from that airport waypoint. Press  with the cur-sor flashing over Ok?to approve the Initialization Page.4.If you are using a KLN 89, or your KLN 89B has been configured for VFR use only, the VFR page will now be displayed to notify you of the VFR limitation. Press to approve this page.5.The Data Base Page is now displayed showing the date the data base expires or the date it expired.  Press  to acknowledgethe information displayed on this page.IntroductioniiKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideIntroduction iii6.The next page displayed will probably be a page showing the VHF communication frequencies for the airport you are at. For now, use the right outer knob to turn to the NAV page type (watch the lower left corner of the screen and the small bar at the bottom to know when you are there). Then use the right inner knob to select the NAV 2 page if not already there. The NAV 2 page shows your present position relative to a nearby VOR. Verify that this position is correct before proceeding.7.Press the  button.  A page with the words  DIRECT TOis nowdisplayed on the screen.In step 8 you will enter the ICAO identifier of the airport.  The identifi- er will have a ÒKÓ prefix for a Continental U.S. airport, a ÒCÓ prefix for  a Canadian airport, or a ÒPÓ prefix (in some cases) for an Alaskan air- port if the identifier is all letters.  For example, LAX becomes KLAX.  For these countries if the identifier contains any numbers, there is no prefix.  For example, TX04 is entered TX04.  For other areas of the  world the airport identifier should be entered identically to how it is charted.8.Rotate the right inner knob until the first character of the airport identifier is displayed. Turn the right outer knob one step clock- wise to move the flashing segment to the second character position. Rotate the right inner knob to select the second charac- ter of the identifier. Use this procedure to enter the complete airport identifier.9.Press  .  The display will change to a page showing the identi- fier, name, city, and state/country of the airport just entered. Confirm that the correct airport is displayed. Press  a secondtime to approve the airport data.10.A Navigation page (specifically the NAV 1 page) is now on the screen. It displays the desired ground track, actual ground track, bearing, and ETE to the destination airport. In addition, it displays a course deviation indicator (CDI).SeeÑwasnÕt that easy?IntroductionivHOW-TO INDEX This index will help you quickly find important procedures at a glance.The list is

KLN 89(B) SYSTEM COMPONENTSA basic KLN 89(B) system consists of a panel mounted KLN 89(B)GPS and a KA 92 GPS antenna.  An altitude input is required to  obtain full navigation and operational capabilities. Additional system components may be added or interfaced to the KLN 89(B) which increase its features and capabilities.  Some of these optional compo- nents include an external course deviation indicator (CDI) or horizontal situation indicator (HSI), autopilot, and external annuncia- tors. Typically, an altitude input, an external indicator, and external annunciators are required for IFR approach certification.The KLN 89(B) panel mounted unit contains the GPS sensor, thenavigation computer, a Gas Plasma Discharge Display, and all con- trols required to operate the unit.  It also includes the data base card  which slides into the left side of the front panel.The KA 92 GPS ÒpatchÓ antenna is available for use with the KLN89(B). It is designed to always be mounted on the top of the aircraft.The KLN 89(B) has analog outputs to drive the left-right deviation barof most mechanical CDIs and HSIs. In addition, the NAV mode of the Bendix/King KFC 150, KAP 150, KAP 150H, KAP 100, KFC 200, KAP 200, KFC 250, KFC 275, KFC 300, and KFC 325 flight control systems may be coupled to the KLN 89(B). Many other autopilots may also be coupled to the KLN 89(B). Actual autopilot performance and capability when coupled to the KLN 89(B) may vary significantly from one autopilot model to another.Altitude may be provided to the KLN 89(B) from an encoding altime- ter or blind encoder. Altitude is used as an aid in position  determination when not enough satellites are in view. All IFR installations require remote annunciators to be mounted in theaircraft panel in order to select and indicate the status of certain KLN 89(B) functions.  En route and terminal IFR certifications require  annunciators for message (MSG) and waypoint alert (WPT).  Non-  precision approach certifications also require a switch/annunciator to select and display when the approach mode is armed or active.Each KLN 89(B) system includes a configuration module which isattached to the KLN 89(B) mounting rack.  The module allows the  KLN 89(B) to be configured for the unique characteristics of your equipment installation.  Parameters that are set by the configuration  module include:¥àWhether the KLN 89B may be used for IFR operations or not,and if it may be used for non-precision approach IFR operations.  KLN 89 may only be used for VFR navigation.¥Whether or not the altitude alert function in enabled.  See section 4.3.¥Whether or not an external fuel management system is interfaced to the KLN 89(B).  See section 4.8.¥Whether or not an external air data computer is interfaced to the KLN 89(B).  See section 4.9.¥The conditions for the aircraft bus voltage alert to activate.  See section 3.16.The configuration information is stored both in the module and in theKLN 89(B) internal memory.  If the KLN 89(B) detects a difference  between the configuration stored in the module and the configuration stored in the internal memory (which should only occur following the exchange of KLN 89 or KLN 89B units), the configuration information will automatically be updated to the configuration specified in the configuration module.If an error is detected in the configuration data, a warning pagestating Configuration Mem Errorwill be displayed during theKLN 89(B) start-up sequence, and the configuration memory will be set to arbitrary default values.  See an authorized Honeywell Service  center to correct the configuration memory error.System Components1-2System ComponentsChapter 1KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideSystem Components 1-3System ComponentsChapter 1This page intentionally left blank Data BaseData BaseChapter 22-0CANADAUSALATIN AM PACIFIC SOUTH PAC SOUTH AMEUROPEEAST EURMID EASTAFRICASOUTH PAC PACIFIC 756045301501530456075604530150153045601651501351201059075604530150153045607590105120135150165180Pacific Data Basecoverage areaOverlap in Pacific & Atlantic  Data Base coverage areasAtlantic Data Base coverage areaAmericas North Data Base coverage areaAmericas South Data Base coverage areaOverlap in Americas North & Americas  South Data Base coverage areasFigure 2-1 KLN 89(B) Data Base Geographical RegionKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideData Base 2-1Data BaseChapter 22.  DATA BASE 2.1. DATA BASICS The data base provides two primary functions.  First, it makes pilot interface with the GPS sensor much easier.  Rather than having to  manually look up and then enter the latitude and longitude for a spe- cific waypoint, it allows you to merely enter a simple waypoint identifier.  The data base automatically looks up and displays the lati-  tude and longitude associated with the identifier.  It should be obvious that the data base saves a lot of tedious latitude/longitude entry and also greatly reduces the potential for data input mistakes.The second function of the data base is that it serves as a very con-venient means to store and easily access aeronautical information. Want to know the name of the airport, the nearest city, or the airport  elevation?  Just unleash the power of the KLN 89(B) and display the  information right on the screen.àThirdly, the KLN 89B data base stores non-precision approaches intheir proper sequence.  This allows you to select an approach as a  whole, rather than entering the approach waypoint by waypoint.2.2. DATA BASE CONTENTS AND COVERAGE AREAS There are four data base coverage areas available for the KLN 89(B). They are referred to as the ÒAmericas NorthÓ data base, the  ÒAmericas SouthÓ data base, the ÒAtlanticÓ data base, and the ÒPacificÓ data base.The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and AeronauticalRadio, Inc. (ARINC) break the world into the ten geographic regions shown in figure 2-1.  The KLN 89(B) Americas North data base con-  tains aeronautical information for the group of ICAO regions consisting of Canada, USA and Latin America. The KLN 89(B) Americas South data base contains aeronautical information for the group of ICAO regions consisting of USA, Latin America and South America. The KLN 89(B) Atlantic data base provides information for the ICAO regions Europe, Africa, East Europe, and Mid East. Likewise, the Pacific data base contains information for East Europe, Mid East, Pacific, and South Pacific.Data Base2-2Data BaseChapter 2The following is a listing of the KLN 89(B) data base contents:AIRPORTS Identifier Name City, State or Country Use type (if heliports, military, or private) Latitude and Longitude Elevation Runway numbers, lengths, surfaces, and lighting Fuel availability Approach types available (precision, non-precision, or none) Radar approach/departure environment Time difference relative to UTC.

ICAO IDENTIFIERS Waypoints are stored in the KLN 89(B) database almost exclusivelyby their ICAO identifiers. ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) is an internationally accepted reference for the data.  In  almost all cases the proper ICAO identifiers may be taken directly from Jeppesen-Sanderson or NOS aeronautical charts.Airport identifiers in the contiguous United States, Alaska, andCanada are special cases in the ICAO system.  Many airport identi-  fiers for these areas have four letters beginning with a prefix letter that corresponds to the geographic area in which it is located.  The  prefix letter for the contiguous U.S. is ÒKÓ.  Thus, the identifier for  Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is KDFW, not DFW (which would be identical to the VOR identifier).  Likewise, the identifier for  Orlando Executive Airport is KORL while the VOR identifier is ORL. The prefix letter for Canada is ÒCÓ and for Alaska is ÒPÓ.NOTE: There are several exceptions in Alaska.  In many cases, air- ports with three letter identifiers receive the prefix ÒPÓ, but there are many that donÕt.  The most reliable method of determining an Alaska  airport identifier is to look it up from the airport name or city.  See sec- tion 3.7.4, ÒSelecting Waypoints by Name or CityÓ.Incidentally, you can program the KLN 89(B) to default to a certain letter (such as ÒKÓ) when you are entering a waypoint identifier. See section 3.4.2, ÒData EntryÓ to learn about this handy feature.Not all airport identifiers receive the prefix letter.  Airport identifiers which are combinations of letters and numbers do not apply to the prefix rule.  Examples of airport identifiers not using the prefix are  3C2, 7TX6, and M33.So remember, if you are entering or looking for an airport identi- fier that is all letters (no numbers) then it will begin with a ÒKÓ prefix in the contiguous U.S., a ÒPÓ in Alaska (in some cases), or  a ÒCÓ in Canada.  If there are numbers in the identifier then a  prefix is not used.  For other areas of the world the airport iden-  tifier stored in the KLN 89(B) data base is identical to how it is charted.2.4. UPDATING THE DATA BASE The information stored in the data base would eventually become obsolete if there wasnÕt some means to update it.  For example, new  airports open, navaids can move or change frequency, communica- tion frequencies can change, and on and on.Data Base2-4Data BaseChapter 2àAdditionally, by FAA regulation, you are required to have a currentdata base in order to use the KLN 89B for a non-precision approach.The data base is contained in a small card which plugs into the leftside of the KLN 89(B) front panel.  It is designed so that there are two  ways for the user to easily keep the data base current.  The first is to  electronically update the data base by means of a 3.5-inch diskette supplied by Honeywell and an IBM-compatible personal computer. This method does not have to involve removing the KLN 89(B) from the aircraftÕs instrument panel.  A jack, usually mounted in the air-  craftÕs instrument panel, provides a means of interfacing the KLN 89(B) with the computer via an interface cable. The diskettes are not returned to Honeywell.The second method of data base update is to remove the old cardand insert a current card.  This method involves returning the old card to Honeywell.Every 28 days, Honeywell receives new NavDataªinformation from Jeppesen Sanderson.  This information is processed and down-  loaded onto both diskettes and data base cards.  Honeywell makes  these two types of update services available to you in a choice of several subscription or random update programs.  See section 2.6 for  details on these programs.NOTE:Honeywell sends the update so that it arrives prior to the nexteffective date.  The new update may be installed any time prior to the  effective date and the KLN 89(B) will use the previous data up to the effective date and automatically begin using the new data on the effective date.  WARNING: The accuracy of the data base information is onlyassured if it is used before the end of the effectivity period. Use  of out of date data base information is done entirely at the userÕs own risk.2.4.1.  COMPUTER UPDATING OF THE DATA BASE Update information is sent to you on 3.5Ó disks. In order to use theupdate program you must have access to a computer having a disk drive capable utilizing 3.5-inch 1.44 megabyte high density diskettes. This computer also needs to have an available COM 1 or COM 2 ser- ial port. If you wish to perform updates in the cockpit, an optional PC  Interface kit must be used.  Included in the kit is an interface cable  that plugs into both the computer and into the data loader jack. The data loader jack is included with the KLN 89(B) installation kit and is typically installed in the aircraftÕs instrument panel.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideData Base 2-5Data BaseChapter 2Data Base2-6Data BaseChapter 2CAUTION:  The data base must be updated only while the air- craft is on the ground.  The KLN 89(B) does not perform any  navigation function while the data base is being updated.  Since  a data base update takes approximately 5 minutes it is a good  idea to turn off all electrical equipment on the aircraft except for the KLN 89(B) to avoid running down the aircraft battery.NOTE:The diskettes sent to you can only be used to update oneKLN 89(B), although they can update that specific unit numerous times.  The first time the diskettes are used in an update operation, a  unique identification code from the KLN 89(B) being used is uploaded to the diskettes. These diskettes may be used in this specific KLN 89(B) an unlimited number of times which could be required if you switch back and forth between the Americas North, Americas South, Atlantic, and Pacific data bases during one update cycle. These diskettes may not, however, be used to update other KLN 89(B)s. This update protection ensures that Jeppesen Sanderson is properly compensated for the use of their NavDataª.To update the KLN 89(B) data base by computer:1.Plug the 9 pin female connector end of the interface cable into a COM serial port of the computer. If the computer has COM 1 and COM 2 serial ports, either may be used. Some computers use a 9 pin COM serial port connector while other computers use a 25  pin connector.  If the computer being used has a 9 pin connector,  the interface cable connector will plug directly into the computerÕs 9 pin connector. If the computerÕs COM serial port uses a 25 pin connector, use the 25 pin to 9 pin adapter included in the PC  interface kit to adapt the interface cableÕs connector to the  computerÕs connector.2.If you are using the PC interface kit in the cockpit, plug the other end of the interface cable (4 conductor male connector) into the data loader jack that is mounted in the aircraft panel.3.Insert the diskette into the computerÕs disk drive. Turn on the computer being used for the data base update. The program on  the disk will automatically ÒbootÓ (load) and the computer screen will display ÒReadyÓ when the computer is ready to continue withthe data base update operation.4.Turn on the KLN 89(B).  Press  as required to approve theSelf Test, Initialization, and Data Base pages.  Use the right outer knob to select the Setup (SET) type pages and the right innerKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideData Base 2-7Data BaseChapter 2knob to select the SET 3 page (figure 2-2).NOTE: The database key is shownon the SET 3 page for ORS 02 soft- ware only.5.Press  .

The estimated load time in minutes is now displayed (figure 2-4).NOTE:In step 6, repeatedly pressingwill terminate the update processand bring the display back to the orig- inal SET 3 page shown in figure 2-2.7.Press  to acknowledge the estimated load time and begin the erasing of the existing data base. The unit will now display Erasing data base.  After the data base has been erased, the loading of the new data automati- cally begins. As the new data is being loaded, the percentage of transfer is displayed (figure 2-5).8.The KLN 89(B) will indicate when the data base update is complete as shown in figure 2-6. You may either turn the KLN 89(B) off at  this point or press to restartthe KLN 89(B).9.Remove the interface cable. Remove the disk from the computer.

If you have a problem that you canÕt resolve, write down any error messages to aid your Honeywell Service Center in identifying the problem.2.4.2 CARD EXCHANGE UPDATING OF THE DATA BASE Having the front-loading data card makes KLN 89(B) very easy to update the data base by exchanging cards.Enclose the expired data base card in the mailer that the new cardwas sent to you in.  A return shipping label is included in the mailer.  Please affix this label to the outside of the mailer. Also, peel off the protective backing from the adhesive on the end flap of the mailer.  Press the flap against the adhesive to seal the container.Please return the expired card promptly by mailing immediately atany mailbox.  No postage is required if mailed from within the U.S.  Users will be billed for cards not returned and no additional cards will be sent until either the expired card or payment for the expired card is received.2.5. USER DEFINED DATA BASE In addition to the published data base of airports, VORs, NDBs, and Intersections stored in the Jeppesen data base, you may create up to 500 other user-defined waypoints.  Section 4.6, ÒCreating User-  defined waypointsÓ describes this further.The KLN 89(B) contains an internal lithium battery that is used toÒkeep-aliveÓ the user-defined data base as well as flight plans.  This  battery has a typical life of three to five years.  It is highly recom-  mended that the battery be replaced every three years at an authorized Honeywell Service Center.2-8Data BaseChapter 2Data Base2.6.

COVERAGE AREA The KLN 89(B) was designed to provide worldwide navigation cover-age from North 74¡latitude to South 60¡Latitude (figure 3-2).  Outside this area, magnetic variation must be manually entered as discussed in section 4.10, ÒOperation Outside the Primary Coverage AreaÓ.   See section 2.2 for the data base geographical regions.3.2. TURN-ON AND SELF TESTWell, itÕs time to get down to business and actually use the KLN 89(B)!  Figure 3-1 can be folded out and used as a reference  during the following procedures.  This is especially handy if youÕre  learning while away from your GPS.  The steps below take a lot of  words to explain, but before you know it, you will be ÒflyingÓ through them.NOTE:When power is applied to the KLN 89(B) it always ÒwakesupÓ in the Leg mode. Only the Leg mode is described in this chapter. In this mode the KLN 89(B) performs great circle navigation (the  shortest distance between two points located on the earthÕs surface). The course deviation output displayed on the unitÕs internal course deviation indicator (CDI) and provided to an external horizontal situa- tion indicator (HSI) or CDI is five nautical miles (full scale sensitivity) left and right in Leg mode. The other modes are described in section 4.7 and chapter 5.Figure 3-2 KLN 89 Navigation Coverage Area74¡60¡45¡30¡15¡0¡15¡30¡45¡60¡74¡60¡45¡30¡15¡0¡15¡30¡45¡60¡Basic GPS Operation3-2Basic GPS OperationChapter 3To turn on and initialize the KLN 89(B):1.Turn on the KLN 89(B) by turning the small power knob clockwise.The Power-On page (figure 3-3)will be displayed for a few seconds.  During this time, the  KLN 89(B) performs an extensive internal test.  The operational  revision status (ORS) level num- ber in the upper right corner ofthe display should match the ORS level indicated on the cover of this PilotÕs Guide .When the internal test is complete, the Power-On page will automatically be replaced by the Self Test page (figure 3-4).NOTE:If the KLN 89(B) is operatingin the Take-Home Mode, the Take- Home Warning Page (figure 3-5) is displayed first and must be acknowledged by pressing . Seesection 4.11 for more information on the Take-Home mode.NOTE:If the data base card is notinstalled in the KLN89(B), a page will be displayed as in figure 3-6. Turn the KLN 89(B) unit power back off, and replace the data base card in the left side of the front panel. Once the card is in place, you may apply power once again and the unit will operate properly.2.Verify that the data displayed on the Self Test page is the same as is being displayed on the appropriate equipment in the aircraft which is interfaced to the KLN 89(B).  If the KLN 89(B) is not  connected to any other equipment in the aircraft, you may skip to step 3.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    MFigure 3-4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-6KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-3Basic GPS OperationChapter 3The distance field in the upper left corner always displays 34.5 nm(or 63.9 km). If the KLN 89(B) is interfaced to a compatible indicator that displays DME distance, the indicator should be displaying 34.5 nautical miles.If the KLN 89(B) is interfaced with a NAV indicator such as anHSI or a course deviation indicator (CDI), the deviation bar (D- bar) should be indicating a half scale deviation to the right.  The  TO/FROM indicator should be showing FROM.If the KLN 89(B) is interfaced with a NAV indicator such that theKLN 89(B) can ÒreadÓ the selected course from the NAV  indicator, then the OBSfield should display the same selectedcourse as on the NAV indicator.The RMIfield always displays 130 degrees. If the KLN89(B) is connected to a compatible RMI in the aircraft, the RMI should indicate a bearing to the station of 130 degrees.If any of the above checks fail, do not use the associated indicator with the KLN 89(B).3.If the KLN 89(B) has passed the internal self test, the bottom of the Self Test page will display Passand all external annunciatorsshould be illuminated.  If instead,  Failis displayed, recycle powerto the KLN 89(B).  If the Self Test page still displays  Fail, theKLN 89(B) requires repair and should not be used for navigation.4.When you are ready to approve the Self-test page, press the  button while the Ok?is flashing.  If it happens not to be flashing, press the button and use the right outer knob to move thecursor there.5.The next page displayed will be the Initialization page (figure 3-8). Verify that the date displayed in  the top left corner of the Initialization page is correct.  The  KLN 89(B) has an internal battery powered calendar/clock, so the date and time normally donÕt require setting.  The battery has a life of approximately 3 years.  In addition, the KLN 89(B)Õs system date and time are automati- APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-8cally updated very precisely when at least one satellite is beingreceived.  However, if for some reason the date or time are incor-  rect, it is necessary to enter the correct date or time so that the KLN 89(B) can reach the navigation mode quickly. The date should be correct and the time should be correct within ten minutes so that the KLN 89(B) will start looking for the correct satellites.If the date is incorrect, rotate theright outer knob counterclockwise until the cursor is over the entire date field (figure 3-9).  Rotate the  right inner knob until the correct day of the month is displayed (figure 3-10).  Then, move the  cursor to the month field by rotat- ing the outer knob one click clockwise and change the month as necessary.  Use the same  methods to select the correct year (figure 3-11).  When the date is  correct, press .6.Verify that the time displayed in the upper right corner of the Initialization page is correct to within ten minutes of the actual time.  Remember, once the  KLN 89(B) receives the first satellite, it will automatically be  very accurately updated by the satellite to the correct time.  However, you are responsible for assuring the desired time zone is selected on the KLN 89(B).  If it is  necessary to reset the time,  position the cursor over the time zone field  (figure 3-12) and  select the desired time zone (figure 3-13).Basic GPS OperationBasic GPS OperationChapter 33-4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-12APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˆ˙˘  Figure 3-13APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-10APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-11APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-9KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs Guide 3-5Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Basic GPS OperationThe KLN 89(B) is capable of displaying the following time zones:UTCCoordinated Universal Time (Zulu)GSTGreenland Standard Time (UTC - 3)GDTGreenland Daylight Time (UTC - 2)ATSAtlantic Standard Time (UTC - 4)ATDAtlantic Daylight Time (UTC - 3)ESTEastern Standard Time (UTC - 5)EDTEastern Daylight Time (UTC - 4)CSTCentral Standard Time (UTC - 6)CDTCentral Daylight Time (UTC - 5)MSTMountain Standard Time (UTC - 7)MDTMountain Daylight Time (UTC - 6)PSTPacific Standard Time (UTC - 8)PDTPacific Daylight Time (UTC - 7)AKSAlaska Standard Time (UTC - 9)AKDAlaska Daylight Time (UTC - 8)HASHawaii Standard Time (UTC - 10)HADHawaii Daylight Time (UTC - 9)SSTSamoa Standard Time (UTC - 11)SDTSamoa Daylight Time (UTC - 10)LCLLocal Time Zone (user-defined)You will be able to change the time zone any time you desire onseveral other pages, so donÕt worry if youÕre not sure which time zone to choose.

Check to see if the displayed initial position is where you actually are.  This latitude/longitude is the last known position before the  power was shut down the last time.  Unless the unit has been  moved since its last use, this position should be correct.

Press to acknowledge the informationon the Data Base page.àNOTE:In some installations, KLN 89B is configured for use in IFREn route and Terminal operations, but not for non-precision approaches. If this is the case, line 3 will read GPS ApproachesDisabledand you will not have access to approaches in the database.WARNING:  The accuracy of the data base information is assured only if the data base is current.  Operators using an out- of-date data base do so entirely at their own risk.NOTE:If your KLN 89(B) is interfaced with a remote Shadin fuel/air data computer but no fuel flow indicator, the Fuel on Board page will be displayed following the Data Base page (figure 3-21). This page allows you to set the amount of fuel on board (FOB) and initializes the Other (OTH) 7 and 8 fuel planning pages. Possible units are gallons (GAL),pounds (LB), imperial gallons (IMP),liters (L), or kilograms ( KG). If you wish to manually set the FOB, usethe right outer knob to move the cursor to line 2 and use the right inner knob to select the desired value. Another option is to move the cursor to Full?and press , which will update the FOB to thetanks-full value set at the time of installation. To go on, move the cursor to Ok?and press .A waypoint page for the waypoint which was active when the KLN89(B) was last turned off will be displayed on the screen.  If the last  active waypoint was an airport, the APT 5 page showing the airportÕscommunications frequencies will be displayed (figure 3-22).  We thought  youÕd like that!  Almost always, the  waypoint which was active when you last turned the KLN 89(B) off is the airport where you landed.  Therefore,  when you get ready to depart, the airport communication frequencies for that airport will automatically  be displayed for you!APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-22APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-21Basic GPS Operation3-8Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Next, youÕll probably want to check the NAV 2 page to see your presentposition.  Use the right outer knob to select the NAV page type and  then the right inner knob, if necessary,  to select the NAV 2 page.  It is quite  likely that the present position will be dashed at first (figure 3-23).  It takes  the KLN 89(B) a couple of minutes to  acquire the GPS satellites and to make its initial calculation of your position. When the KLN 89(B) reaches a NAV ready status and is able to navigate,  the NAV 2 page will display your pre- sent position relative to the nearest VOR (figure 3-24).  Verify that the pre-  sent position shown on the NAV 2 page is correct.NOTE:In order to reach a Nav ready status, the aircraft must be away from obstructions blocking the  GPS antennaÕs view of required satel-  lites.  If the KLN 89(B) fails to reach a Nav ready status within five  minutes refer to section 3.6, ÒInitialization And Time To First FixÓ.3.3. DISPLAY FORMAT The KLN 89(B) uses a Dot Matrix Gas Plasma Display.  In normal  operation, the display screen is divided into two segments by a vertical line, called the page divider.  In some cases, such as the display of  system messages or the turn-on and self test sequence, the page divider disappears and you have a Òfull-screenÓ page.Aeronautical information is presented on the screen in the form ofÒpagesÓ.  A page is a presentation of specific data in an organized for-  mat.  Various page ÒtypesÓ are used to display related kinds of data.  For example, one page type is NAV (navigation).  NAV pages show  information such as distance, groundspeed, bearing, course, and other  data relating to navigation.  Another page type is APT (airport).  APT  pages contain information pertinent to a specific airport such as name,  city, state, elevation, and direction and distance relative to the aircraftÕs  present position.The units of measure for displayed information can be changed using the SET 8 page. (Refer to section 2-12 for details on this page.) The  altimeter barometric setting can be set to inches of Mercury (Ò), mil- libars (mB), or hectopascals (hP). Altitude, airport elevation, and runway lengths can be set to feet (ft) or meters (m). Finally, distances  and velocities can be set to nautical miles (nm) and knots (kt) or kilo- APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-23APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-24KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-9Basic GPS OperationChapter 3meters (km) and kilometers/hour (k/h). Changing any of the units of measure only affects the information displayed on the unit. It does not affect any of the data output by the unit.The brightness of the display is controlled by a photocell on the    KLN 89(B) front panel.  The brighter the light level, the brighter the display  will be.  The minimum (nighttime) brightness is set at the factory to a  level that is appropriate for most installation.  In some cases, however,  it may be desired to change the minimum brightness level (e.g. an  unusually dark cockpit environment). The SET 11 page controls the  minimum brightness.To adjust the minimum display brightness: 1.Select the SET 11 page (figure 3-25) and turn on the cur-  sor (). The display brightnesshas a range of zero (0) to 9 with zero being the dimmest, 9 being the brightest, and 4 being the normal default level.2.Turn the right inner knob to select the desired brightness (figure 3-26).  To test the bright-  ness level, you will probably want to be in a dark-cockpit condition.If desired, you can also test it out by placing your finger over the photocell in the upper left corner of the KLN 89(B)3.Turn off the cursor ( ).The top left corner of the screen always displays distance to the active waypoint, in nice large numbers (figure 3-27). The identifier of the active waypoint is usually displayedon the second line. This area of the display will be particularly useful to you if you are shooting non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B, since it lets you know where youÕre going and how far until youget there.NOTE:In cases when the activewaypoint identifier is displayed on the right side of the page divider, line 2  will display the current groundspeed (figure 3-28).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-28APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-27APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-25APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    &Figure 3-26Basic GPS Operation3-10Basic GPS OperationChapter 3NOTE:For purposes of this PilotÕsGuide, many of the screen  illustrations do not show actual  navigation data in this area as in figure 3-29. In these cases, the  displayed data is not relevant to the discussion of the KLN 89(B)Õs operation.The third line of the left side has threepurposes: (1) If the KLN 89(B) is  ready for you to approve something,  such as a selected waypoint, the ÒEntÓ prompt will flash (figure 3-30),indicating you should press the button to continue. (2) If the KLN  89(B) has a new message for you which must be viewed on a message page, a large ÒMÓ will flash in thesame area (figure 3-31) telling you to press the button and view thenew message. (3) Immediately to the right of the Òmessage/enterÓ  display area, the navigation mode (see section 4.7 for details) is dis- played. If the KLN 89(B) is in the Leg mode (the normal mode of operation), ÒLegÓ will be displayed here.The bottom line on the left side of the page divider indicates the pagetype that is being displayed on the right side of the screen. In figure 3-31, the NAV 1 (Navigation 1) page is being displayed.You might think of the page types as the chapters in a book and thepage numbers as the pages within a chapter. Just as a chapter in a book may have from one to many pages, a KLN 89(B) page type may have from three to 25 pages associated with it. There are, for  example, 25 flight plan pages (FPL 0, FPL 1, FPL 2, É FPL 25) in the flight plan page type and up to eight airport pages (APT 1, APT 2, É APT 8) in the airport page type.Figure 3-32 shows an example of an APT 5 page.

In this case the Ò+Ó sign indicates that there are two or more APT 5 pages. Figure 3-33 shows the second APT 5 page for KICT (Wichita Mid-Continent Airport).The lower left corner of the display,where the page type and number are usually displayed, can also display short operational messages to the user called Òscratchpad messagesÓ. These messages are displayed forapproximately five seconds, then this area returns to a display of the page type and number.  Figure 3-34 shows an example of a scratch-  pad message indicating a duplicate identifier. A complete listing of scratchpad messages is available in Appendix C of this PilotÕs Guide.3.4. BASIC OPERATION OF PANEL CONTROLS The KLN 89(B) controls are very easy to use.  Most of the page  selection and data entry is done with the knobs on the right side of the front panel and the cursor () button immediately above them.There are seven buttons across the bottom: (Message), ,(Altitude), (Nearest), (Direct To), (Clear), and  (Enter).The cursor position is indicated by flashing, underlined text on thescreen.  Many pages allow you to add, delete, or change data on the  screen by first pressing the button to turn the cursor function onand bring the cursor on the screen. The right knobs are then used to enter or change data.  When the cur-  sor is on the screen, the lower left corner of the screen will show  *CRSR*rather than the page namefor that particular page (figure 3-35). The cursor is over PRESENT POSN.In addition, this PilotÕs Guide uses white ÒwhiskersÓ to depict flashingcharacters on the screen.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ( Figure 3-34APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-35APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-333.4.1. PAGE SELECTIONIt is now time to learn to select a desired page.NOTE:The cursor function is not used in selecting pages and thebutton should not be pressed at this time.  If  CRSRis annunciat-ed in the lower left corner of the display, press the button to turn the cursor function off.The right outer knob is rotated to select one of eleven page types forthe display.  These eleven page types are the following:Remember that the page type is displayed at the lower left corner ofthe screen.  The first three letters of the page type are often used for  annunciation on the screen, for example, CALrepresents Calculatorpage.  The page type is also annunciated by means of a bar at the  bottom of the display, which moves as you turn the right outer knob.  All the page types are listed across the front panel directly under thedisplay, and the bar will always be over one of them.  For example, letÕs  say you were on a NAV page    (figure 3-36) and you wanted to turn to a SET page.  You would look at the list  and see that the SET pages are three places to the right of the NAV pages.Basic GPS Operation3-12Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-36Chapter Name/ Page # RangePage TypePage Functions APT 1-6*AirportDirectory of published airports  VOR 1-2VORDirectory of published VOR stations  NDB 1-2NDBDirectory of published non-directional beacons (NDB)  INT 1-2IntersectionsDirectory of published named intersections  USR 0-3User WaypointDirectory of user-defined waypoints  ACT **Active WaypointInformation about the active waypoint  NAV 1-4NavigationNavigation data  FPL 0-25Flight PlanActive and stored flight plans  CAL 1-8CalculatorDistance, bearing, time and fuel calculator; air data calculations based on pilot-entered inputsSET 1-11SetupSetting initial position and date/time, updating the data base, and selecting certain featuresOTH 1-6***OtherStatus reports, and deleting user wpts and remarks  *KLN 89B\\'s which are approved for non-precision approaches have 8 airport pages. **Varies with the type of waypoints in the active flight plan.  ***Up to 12 with fuel management system and air data interfaces. KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-13Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Therefore, turning the right outerknob three clicks clockwise will get you to the SET pages (figure 3-37). The annunciator bar and the page labels work kind of like a map to get you from one page type to another.  The page type selection wrapsaround from Other (OTH) to Airport (APT); that is, the knob has no  mechanical stops.Once you have selected the desired page type using the right outerknob, you may select the page number by rotating the right inner knob.  LetÕs use an example to make sure you understand.  You are  presently viewing the APT 2 page and you wish to view the NAV 3 page.  Rotating the right outer knob 6 (six) clicks clockwise will  display the NAV page that you last viewedÑweÕll say the NAV 2 page.  Turning the right inner knob one click clockwise or three clicks  counterclockwise will bring you to the NAV 3 page.  Got it?NOTE:In this PilotÕs Guide the right smaller knob is assumed to bein the ÒinÓ position unless it specifically states that the knob should be in the ÒoutÓ position.  Therefore, the words Òrotate the right inner  knobÓ mean to turn the right inner knob while the knob is in the ÒinÓ position.3.4.2. DATA ENTRY Now that youÕve learned how to select the desired page, youÕre readyto learn the means of entering data.  It is necessary to enter data, for  example, in order to specify a waypoint of your choice to go Direct To.  The general procedure for entering a waypoint identifier is described below and is shown in fig- ures 3-38 through 3-46 for entering a  waypoint (in this case, First Flight air- port in North Carolina, identifier KFFA) on the Calculator (CAL) 1 page.To enter a waypoint identifier: 1.If the cursor is not on the screen (figure 3-38), press to turn onthe cursor function (figure 3-39).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-39APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-38APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-37Basic GPS Operation3-14Basic GPS OperationChapter 32.If required, rotate the right outer knob to position the cursor (figure 3-40).3.Rotate the right inner knob to select the first character of the waypoint identifier (figure 3-41).4.Turn the right outer knob one click clockwise to move the cursor to the second character position (figure 3-42).5.Rotate the right inner knob to select the second character (figure 3-43).6.Use the right outer and inner knobs in this manner until the complete waypoint identifier is  displayed (figure 3-44).  Note that  you may not have to enter the last characters of the identifier because each time you enter a character, the KLN 89(B) offers you the first identifier in the data base beginning with the charac- ters you have entered.7.If  Entis flashing on the left side of the screen, then press  .This will prompt the KLN 89(B) to  display a waypoint page for the waypoint identifier you just entered (figure 3-45).8.Verify the waypoint information displayed, and then press again to approve the waypoint  page.  The display will return to  the page previously displayed (figure 3-46).Often, you will find yourself enteringairports that begin with the same  character over and over again.

Also, many airport identifiers in  Europe begin with the letter E or the letter L. Especially when flying VFR, you will mostly want to enter Direct To or Flight Plan waypoints which are airports. The KLN 89(B) has a great feature that will save you turns of the knob when you know that the first character will probably be a K, E, L, or other letter that is commonly used in your part of the world.  You can set the default first waypoint identifier  character on the SET 5 page.To change the default first way-point identifier character:1.Select the SET 5 page (figure 3- 47) and turn on the cursor ( )(figure 3-48).2.Use the right inner knob to select the desired character (figure 3-49), such as a K in the U.S., a C in Canada, a P in  Alaska, an E or an L in Europe,  etc.3.Turn off the cursor.  To try it out, proceed to the SET 1 page (initial position).  Turn the cursor ( )on (it will come on over the way- point field).  Try turning the right  inner knob one click clockwise (figure 3-50). ThereÕs the character you just selected on the SET 5 page!3.4.3. THE DUPLICATEWAYPOINT PAGEThere are some waypoints in the data base whose identifiers are notunique.  That is, more than one waypoint has the same identifier.  When a waypoint identifier has been entered which is not unique to a single waypoint, a Duplicate Waypoint page appears on the screen. The Duplicate Waypoint page is used to select which of the waypoints having the same identifier is actually desired.  The  waypoint identifier is displayed on the top left of the page.  To the  right of the identifier is the number of waypoints in the data base  having the identifier.  Below the identifier is a list of the waypoint APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH a  Figure 3-50APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-47APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-48APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   \\'Figure 3-49Basic GPS Operation3-16Basic GPS OperationChapter 3types (APT, VOR, NDB, INT, USR) and the associated countrieswhich use the identifier.To see an example of a Duplicate Waypoint page, try entering the identifier ÒDÓ as a Direct To waypoint or a Flight Plan Waypoint:1.Press  .2.Select the letter Ò DÓ as thewaypoint identifier (figure 3-51).

At  the time of this writing, there were  three waypoints in the Americas data base having the identifier D.If there are more than four waypoints having the same identifier, only the first three are initially shown.  The list includes an NDB in Canada, an NDB in Cuba, and an NDB in the U.S.  The cursor  will be over the first waypoint listed.  They are listed with the way-  point closest to the aircraftÕs present position displayed first and the waypoint farthest from the aircraft displayed last.  To view the  rest of the choices, rotate the right outer knob clockwise.  Doing  so will move the flashing cursor over waypoints two, three and then will cause the waypoint list to ÒscrollÓ so that the other way- points in the list may be seen.4.To select the desired waypoint, move the cursor over the  appropriate choice (figure 3-53).5.Press  and the display willchange to the waypoint page for the selected waypoint (figure 3- 54).6.Press  again to approve thewaypoint page.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-53APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-54APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-52APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-513.4.4. CYCLIC FIELDSOn many of the KLN 89(B) pages,there are cyclic fields, which are pre-ceded by a carat (>).  A cyclic field is one that you as the pilot can select from two or more options.  For exam-  ple, in figure 3-55, the field  >135¡To(magnetic bearing to Austin VOR) is a cyclic field.  In this case, the  second option is the magnetic radial from Austin VOR to presentposition.To change a cyclic field: 1.Turn on the cursor by pressing the button (figure 3-56).2.Using the right outer knob, move the cursor over the cyclic field you wish to change (figure 3-57).3.Press the  button to changethe cyclic field (figure 3-58).  Notice that repeated pressesÒcycleÓ you through the choices. In this case there are only two, so works like a toggle switch.3.5. MESSAGE PAGE Whenever the KLN 89(B) wants to get your attention, the message  prompt (a large ÒMÓ on the left side of  the screen) begins flashing (figure 3- 60).  If you have a remote message  annunciator in your aircraft, it will also begin flashing at that time.  You should view the message at your  earliest opportunity because the unit may be alerting you to some sit- uation of immediate concern to its condition or to your flight. A description of each possible message is included in Appendix B of  this PilotÕs Guide.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-17Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-60APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-55APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH =:  Figure 3-56APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-57APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-58To view a message:1.Press the  button.

If all of the messages cannot be displayed on  one Message page, repeated presses of will show the othermessages before returning to normal operation.  If a message con-  dition exists which requires a specific action by you, the message prompt will remain on but will not flash.3.6. INITIALIZATION AND TIME TO FIRST FIX Since the KLN 89(B) stores its position and other required parameters  in memory when power to the unit is removed, it is seldom necessary  to aid the unit in reaching a NAV ready condition.  The time required  from power on until the KLN 89(B) determines its present position and  is therefore ready to navigate is called Òtime to first fix.Ó  The time to first  fix is normally a few minutes or less. In order for the KLN 89(B) to reach a NAV ready condition, it is necessary to meet the following con- ditions:1.The KLN 89(B)Õs ÒalmanacÓ data should be current.  Almanac data is orbital information for all the satellites and is used for initial acquisition when the KLN 89(B) is first turned on.  This data is  stored in the KLN 89(B)Õs non-volatile memory and is considered  current for up to six months.  Each satellite sends almanac data for  all satellites.  Since the KLN 89(B) routinely updates the almanac  data during normal operation, the almanac data will become out of  date only if the KLN 89(B) hasnÕt been used for the previous six  months or longer.  Collecting new almanac data takes place auto-  matically if the data is more than six months old. If the almanac data is out of date and needs to be collected, the KLN 89(B) will  take a few minutes to acquire your present position (usually about  six (6) minutes, but not more than 12 minutes). The Self Test, Initialization, and Data Base pages should be approved.  2.The aircraft must be located such that the GPS antenna has an unobstructed view of the sky so that required satellite signals are Basic GPS Operation3-18Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-61KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-19Basic GPS OperationChapter 3not being blocked.  If possible, position the aircraft away from hangars or other obstructions. 3.It is very helpful for the KLN 89(B) to have the correct time, date and position to be able to determine which satellites should be in view. This information is stored in the battery backed memory of  the KLN 89(B) so it is not normally required to update it. If the KLN  89(B) has the correct time, date and position, then the time to first  fix will usually be less than two (2) minutes. If this information is not  correct, then the KLN 89(B) will start to look for any satellites. Eventually, the KLN 89(B) will find enough satellites to determine the position of the aircraft. This process can take as long as 12 minutes. It is possible for you to update this information manually,  which will allow the KLN 89(B) to reach a NAV ready status much  faster. To set the time and date follow steps 5 and 6 in section 3.2,  ÒTurn-On and Self-Test.Ó The initial position is usually set during turn-on and self-test, but if for some reason it is necessary to update the position after the power-on sequence, then use the fol-  lowing steps. Remember, if acquisition time is not important then it  is not necessary to update the time, date or position.To initialize the position from the SET 1 page: 1.If the cursor is not on the screen (figure 3-62), press the buttonto bring it on the page over the INIT POSfield (figure 3-63).2.Using the right inner and outer knobs, enter the identifier for the airport where you are presently located or the identifier of a navaid  or other airport which is close to your present position (figure 3-64).  Any waypoint in the data base which is within 60 miles is accept- able, but the closer the better. Remember, if you are entering an  airport identifier that is all letters (no numbers), then it will begin with a ÒKÓ prefix in the contiguous  U.S., a ÒPÓ in Alaska (in some cases; in others, the prefix is not added), or a ÒCÓ in Canada.  If there are numbers in the identifier  then a prefix is not used.  Outside the contiguous U.S., Alaska, and Canada, use the airport identifiers as they are charted.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-62APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-63APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˇ//  Figure 3-64Basic GPS Operation3-20Basic GPS OperationChapter 33.Once you have entered the complete identifier, press .The display will change to the waypoint page for the waypoint  you entered (figure 3-65).4.If this is the waypoint you intended to enter, press  again.  The display will change back to the SET 1 page.NOTE:As an alternative, you can also enter the approximate latitude and longitude of your present position directly on the SET 1 page instead of entering a waypoint.5.With the right inner knob, position the cursor over Ok?, if it is notalready there (figure 3-66).6.Press  to approve the initialposition. The cursor will  automatically be removed from the screen.NOTE:If the KLN 89(B) is in the Take-Home mode, you are allowed to  enter the groundspeed ( kt) and head-ing (¡) fields in order to simulate flight (figure 3-67).  They are not used for  actual initialization in an aircraft. However, entering a ground speed will  allow the KLN 89(B) to ÒflyÓ along the active flight plan (or to a direct to  waypoint) starting from the initialization waypoint.  A heading may be  entered in the initial heading field while in the Take-Home mode if the  one offered is not desired.  See section 4.11 for more details on the  Take-Home mode.7.Select the NAV 2 page. When the KLN 89(B) reaches the NAV ready status and is therefore able to navigate, the NAV 2 page will display the present position. Verify that the latitude and longitude or the waypoint, radial, and distance display of present position are  correct.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-67APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-66APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-653.7. SELECTING AND SCANNING WAYPOINTS There are five types of waypoints: airports, VORs, NDBs, intersections,and user waypoints.  Waypoints in the published data base fall into one  of the first four types.  You can create up to 500 user waypoints to  supplement the waypoints in the data base (see section 4.2.1 to create  a user waypoint).There are three methods you may use to select a specific waypoint for viewing.  You may enter the waypointÕs identifier directly, you may scan  through the waypoint identifiers in alphabetical order, or you may enter  the waypointÕs name.  If the waypoint is an airport, you may also select  it by entering the city where the airport is located.3.7.1. SELECTING WAYPOINTS BY IDENTIFIER The most direct way of selecting a specific waypoint is to simply enterthe waypointÕs identifier directly on the appropriate waypoint page type (APT, for example).  LetÕs use Chicago OÕHare International  Airport whose identifier is KORD as an example.To select a waypoint by identifier from a waypoint page: 1.Use the right outer and inner knobs to select the Airport 1 (APT 1) page (figure 3-68).  (Actually,  the airport identifier can be  entered on any of the Airport pages but weÕll use the APT 1 since it displays the airport name and city).2.Turn on the cursor ( ) andmake sure the right inner knob is pushed in.  The cursor will  appear over the first character of the airport identifier (figure 3-69).3.Turn the right inner knob to select a ÒKÓ as the first character (figure  3-70).  You may turn the knob  either clockwise or counterclock- wise, and the letters and  numbers wrap around with a blank character separating the Ò9Ó and the ÒAÓ.  Notice that as  you turn through letters, the KLN 89(B) automatically fills in the identifier of the first waypoint in alphanumeric order in the data-KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-21Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-68APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH /  Figure 3-69APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH \\'  Figure 3-70Basic GPS Operation3-22Basic GPS OperationChapter 3base which matches what youÕveentered so far (in this case, Hall Airport in Kaufman, Texas).  Go  ahead and experiment a little bit.4.Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the second  character and select an ÒOÓ  (figure 3-71).5.Use the same process to select an ÒRÓ and then a ÒDÓ          (figure 3-72).  You are now viewing the  APT 1 page for KORD.The KLN 89(B) feature of filling in characters of the identifier can be atime saver!  For a second example, letÕs select Bloomington VOR  whose identifier is BMI.More selecting a waypoint by identifier:1.Make sure you have turned the cursor off from the previous example.  With the right knobs,  select the VOR 1 page (figure 3-73).2.Turn the cursor ( ) on.3.Change the first character to a ÒBÓ (figure 3-74).4.Move the cursor to the second character and select Ò MÓ(figure 3-75).  Eureka!  When you  entered the ÒMÓ, the KLN 89(B)searched its data base for the first VOR identifier beginning with the letters ÒBMÓ and found BMI.Many times you will only have to enter two or three characters of the waypoint identifier and the KLN 89(B) will furnish the rest.5.Turn off the cursor ( ).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-73APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-74APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH 0  Figure 3-75APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-71APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-723.7.3. SELECTING WAYPOINTS BY SCANNINGYou may also select waypoints by scanning through them.  This may be done with the cursor either on or off.To select a waypoint by scanning with the cursor off: 1.Select the page type for the waypoint you are looking for (APT, VOR, NDB, INT or USR).2.Pull the right inner knob to the ÒoutÓ position.  3.Turn the right inner knob clockwise to scan through the waypoints in alphabetical order, or counterclockwise to scan in reverse alphabetical order.  Remember that numbers are  considered lower in order than letters.  Thus, the airport identifier  KA2comes before KAAF.NOTE:The faster you turn the knob while scanning, the larger thestep through the waypoints.  This variable rate scanning allows you to get from one end of the list to the other very quickly.  When the knob  is turned slowly, you will go through the waypoints one at a time.You may also want to scan waypoints with the cursor on.  This is especially useful if you remember the first part of the identifier, or if you wanted to scan all airports that start with a KL, for example.LetÕs give it a try.To select a waypoint by scanning with the cursor on: 1.Select the page type for the waypoint you are looking for (APT, VOR, NDB, INT or USR).  In this case, we want the APT 1 page.2.Turn on the cursor ( ).  It will appear over the first character of the waypoint identifier.

SELECTING WAYPOINTS BY NAME OR CITY When you know the identifier of the desired waypoint you will useone of the two methods just described to select it.  However, what if  you know the name but you donÕt know the identifier of your desired waypoint?  YouÕre in luck because the KLN 89(B) will allow you to  enter the first few characters of the name to help you find it in the data base.  We will use a couple of examples to illustrate how this is  done.  For VORs and NDBs, you may use the navaid name.  For air-  ports, you may use the airport name or the city name (where the  airport is located).In this first example we want to view the information in the KLN 89(B)data base for Napoleon VOR (located just east of Kansas City) but we donÕt remember the identifier for it.To select a VOR or NDB by navaid name:1.With the cursor off, use the right knobs to select the VOR 1 page  (figure 3-79).  The VOR waypoint  in view is not important.2.Press  and then make surethe right inner knob is pushed to the ÒinÓ position.3.With the right outer knob, move the cursor over the first character in the VOR name which is being displayed (figure 3-80).4.Change this first character to an ÒNÓ in this case (figure 3-81).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˜ Figure 3-80APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-81APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-79APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-78KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-25Basic GPS OperationChapter 35.Move the cursor one space to the right and select the second char- acter, ÒAÓ (figure 3-82).6.Select the third character, Ò PÓ(figure 3-83).

LetÕs use this method to find La Guardia Airport in New York City.To select an airport by scanning the airport name: 1.With the cursor off and the right inner knob in the ÒinÓ position, select the APT (Airport) 1 page.  The airport displayed at this time is not important.2.Turn on the cursor ( ).3.Move the cursor over the first character in the airport name (figure 3-84).4.Change the first character to an ÒLÓ.5.Move the cursor one place to the right, and select an Ò AÓ(figure 3-85).6.Now, move the cursor one place to the right and pull the right inner knob out.

ÒNEARESTÓ FUNCTIONSAt any time, you can have access to the nearest airports, waypoints,Special Use Airspace (SUA), Flight Service Station (FSS) frequen- cies, and Center frequencies to your position.  Your ticket to do this is  the handy button.When you first press the button,a page is displayed asking which nearest function you would like to  select (figure 3-88).  The choices are:APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-88APTAirportsVORVORsNDBNDBsINTIntersectionsUSRUser-defined waypointsSUASpecial Use AirspacesFSSFlight Service Station FrequenciesCTRCenter FrequenciesTo select the desired nearest function, use the right inner knob tomove the cursor to the desired selection and press .  Notice that the cursor is initially over the APTfield, so you may press thenpress immediately to access the nearest airports.Selecting any of the waypoint types(APT, VOR, NDB, INT, or USR)takes you immediately to the way-  point page for the first nearest  waypoint of that type, for example, the nearest airport (figure 3-89).3.8.1. VIEWING THE NEAREST WAYPOINTS There are actually two waypoint scan lists for airports, VORs, NDBs,intersections and user-defined waypoints.  These two lists are the  ÒcompleteÓ list and the ÒnearestÓ list.  The complete list contains all of  the waypoints in the data base for a waypoint type (all the airports, for example).  The nearest list consists of the nine nearest waypoints (of  that type) to your present position.  Therefore, if you are in the near-  est airport list, it will contain the nine nearest airports relative to your location.The nearest list is positioned in front of the complete list.  That is, instead of using the button, you may scan backwards (turn theright inner knob counterclockwise while in the Òpulled outÓ position) through the complete list to reach the nearest list.  You will know  when you have reached the nearest list because the top middle por- tion of the waypoint page will flash the relative position of the waypoint to your position.  Ò 1Ó indicates nearest (figure 3-89) while Ò9Óindicates the ninth nearest (figure 3-  90).  As you scan clockwise with the  right inner knob Ò1, 2, 3, ..., 9Ó, thenext scan position is the beginning of the complete list.  The nearest list can KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-27Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-89APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-90only be reached by scanning backwards. It does not wrap aroundafter the last waypoint in the complete list.Waypoint pages displayed in the nearest list do not contain a latitudeand longitude position as they do in the complete list.  Instead, the  bearing and distance to the waypoint (or the radial and distance from the waypoint) are displayed.  In addition, nearest airport pages dis-  play the length, surface, and lighting of the longest runway.  Once the  nearest waypoint is being displayed, the other waypoint pages (for example, APT 2 and APT 3) for that airport are available for display by making sure the right inner knob is pushed in and then turning it to select the desired airport page.3.8.1.1  Nearest Airport CriteriaThe nine airports in the nearest list are the nine airports which meetthe criteria selected on the Setup 6 (SET 6) page. For example, youprobably wouldnÕt want to take a turboprop into a 1500 foot grass strip! The SET 6 page allows you to specify what criteria you want an airport to meet before it is considered for the nearest airport list.To specify the nearest airport criteria: 1.Select the SET 6 page and turn on the cursor ( ).2.Use the right inner knob to select the minimum length runway desired for the airport to qualify for the nearest airport list (figure 3-91).  Values between 1000 feet  and 5000 feet or between 300m and 1500m in 100 foot or meter increments may be selected.3.Rotate the right outer knob clockwise to move the cursor over the runway surface criteria.4.Turn the right inner knob to select either  HRDor ANY.  If  ANYischosen, then both hard and soft surface runways meeting the required runway length will be included in the nearest airport list. If HRDis chosen, then only hard surface runways will be includ-ed.  Hard surface runways include concrete, asphalt, pavement,  tarmac, brick, bitumen, and sealed.  Soft surface runways include  turf, gravel, clay, sand, dirt, ice, steel matting, shale, and snow.For example, if the minimum runway criteria selected is 2200feet inlength and HRDsurface, then only airport having a hard surface runwayat least 2200 feet in length will be displayed in the nearest airport list.Basic GPS Operation3-28Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-91KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-29Basic GPS OperationChapter 33.8.1.2  Continuous Display of Nearest AirportWhen the nearest airport page is initially displayed, Ò1Ó is displayed inthe upper right hand corner of the page to designate this airport as the nearest airport.  However, if you continue to fly along your flight  plan with this page selected, the same airport will be displayed and its position in the nearest airport list will change from 1to 2, 3, 4... 9until finally it wonÕt be in the nearest airport list at all.  The reason for  this is that in the event of an actual emergency once you have determined which airport you are heading for, you donÕt want the nearest airport list to update while you are maneuvering or looking up data on the other airport pages for that airport.There may be times, however, when youÕre flying over ÒunfriendlyÓterrain when you wish to always have the nearest airport displayed on the screen.To display the nearest airport continuously: 1.Display the nearest airport page by pressing  followed bypressing .2.Turn on the cursor ( ).3.Rotate the right outer knob clockwise to position the cursor over Ò1Ó (figure 3-92).  As long as the cursor is left in this position, this page will update so that the nearest airport is always shown as the flight progresses.3.8.2. VIEWING THE NEAREST SPECIAL USE AIRSPACES The KLN 89(B) data base stores the locations of areas of special useairspace (SUA).  The types of SUA areas stored in the data base and the abbreviations used to denote these areas are the following:Class BCL BClass CCL CControl Area (used outside USA)CTATerminal Area (used outside USA)TMAAlert AreaALRTCaution AreaCAUTDanger AreaDNGRMilitary Operations AreaMOAProhibited AreaPROHRestricted AreaRESTAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH $  Figure 3-92Basic GPS Operation3-30Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Training AreaTRNGWarning AreaWARNTerminal Radar Service AreaTRSAThe nearest special use airspace fea-ture is constantly keeping track of the five nearest areas of SUA.  Pressing  the button and selecting the SUAoption will display the SUA 1 page for the nearest SUA to your location, including those which you are inside(figure 3-93).  Turn to section 3.17 to learn more about how an alti-  tude input affects special use airspace sensing and how the KLN  89(B) determines if you are inside special use airspace or not.The SUA 1 page displays the following information: Line 1:The name of the special use airspace area.Line 2:The SUA type (see the list of abbreviations above, thisparticular SUA is Class B airspace), and the sequence number (1st nearest, 2nd nearest, etc.).Line 3:The altitude limits of the SUA.Line 4:The proximity of the nearest point on the border of the SUA,in the form of the absolute bearing, relative bearing, and distance to the SUA border.  The absolute bearing is the approximate heading  you would fly to most quickly get into the SUA.  The relative bearing  arrow in the middle of this line points to the SUA border, telling you if it is directly ahead of you (cc), straight off your left wing (dd), etc.  Finally, the distance to the SUA is displayed on the right side of line 4.If the aircraft is inside the SUA, line 4 will read *A/C INSIDE SUA*, ifyou are above or below the SUA, as indicated by the encoding altimeter, line 4 will indicate this (*A/C ABOVESUA* or *A/C BELOW SUA*).A single clockwise turn of the rightinner knob selects the SUA 2 page, which displays either the controlling ATC facility (figure 3-94), or if the spe- cial use airspace is a Class B, Class C, CTA, or TMA, the page will be dis- played as in figure 3-95, instructing you to press to see the APT 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-94APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-95APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-93KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-31Basic GPS OperationChapter 3page (airport communications) for the primary airport so that the cor-rect communications frequency may be determined.To scan through the remainder of the nearest SUA areas, pull theright inner knob to the ÒoutÓ position and turn it clockwise to view the SUA pages for the  second nearest through fifth nearest SUAs.NOTE:The KLN 89(B) displays the five nearest SUAs regardless ofyour present altitude and the altitude limits of the SUA.  For instance, it will include SUAs specified as ÒBelow 6000ftÓ even if you are cruis- ing at 10,000 feet.3.8.3. Viewing the Nearest Flight Service Station FrequenciesThe KLN 89(B) stores in its data base the locations of Flight ServiceStations (FSS) and their remote communications sites.  In addition,  the KLN 89(B) determines which two of these FSS points of commu- nication are closest to your present location.  What a convenience for  you!  Next time you want to file a flight plan from the air or contact an  FSS for some other reason, you can easily use the KLN 89(B) to determine a suitable FSS and the appropriate frequency. NOTE:In some areas of the world the KLN 89(B) provides the loca-tion of the nearest point of communication with a facility providing information (INF) or radio (RDO) services.Pressing the button and selecting the FSSoption will display twoof the nearest points of communication with Flight Service Stations. There will normally be two FSS 1 pages, one for each of the two points of contact.  The name of the FSS is at the top of the page.  There can be from one to three frequencies included for a point of contact (figure 3-96).  Remember that  in the U.S. the frequency 122.00 MHz is used for ÒFlight WatchÓ and the fre- quency 123.60 MHz is used for  Aeronautical Advisory Service.  As  you know, it is often possible to com- municate with an FSS by transmitting on 122.10 MHz and listening on the VOR frequency.  In cases like this,  the FSS 1 page displays the frequen- cies to use for transmit and receive and also the name of the VOR  through which you are communicat- ing (figure 3-97).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-96APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-973.8.4. Viewing the Nearest Center FrequenciesThe KLN 89(B) also stores in its database the low altitude boundaries of each of the ARTCC ÒCentersÓ.  The  KLN 89(B) determines the proper Center to contact and the appropriate frequencies to use for the aircraftÕs present position.  Pressing the  button and selecting the CTRoption will display this information toyou (figure 3-98).  Next time you wish to obtain VFR flight following or  communicate with Center for any reason, you have a quick way to get a frequency for establishing contact!  Appendix D contains a list-  ing of Center abbreviations used on the CTR page.NOTE:Frequencies for Area Control Centers are displayed on theCTR page for some areas of the world.3.9. DIRECT TO OPERATION The button is used to initiate DirectTo operation (navigation from your pre- sent position direct to your destination). When is pressed, the Direct Topage will be displayed with a flashing  cursor over a waypoint identifier (figure 3-99).  The waypoint identifier which appears on the Direct To page is  chosen by the KLN 89(B) according to the following rules:1.If the Flight Plan 0 (FPL 0) page is displayed on the screen and the cursor is over one of the waypoint identifiers in FPL 0 when  ispressed, then that waypoint identifier will appear on the DIR page. You will appreciate this feature when you learn to use flight plans in section 4.2.2.If the KLN 89(B) is displaying the NAV 4 page and the right inner knob is in the ÒoutÓ position, then the waypoint highlighted in the lower right hand corner of the NAV 4 map display will be the default waypoint. You will also find this feature useful when operating from the active flight plan especially during approaches with the KLN 89B.OR . . . 3.If there is any waypoint page (APT, VOR, NDB, INT, USR, or ACT page) in view when  is pressed, then the DIR page will contain the identifier for the waypoint just viewed.Basic GPS Operation3-32Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ,aFigure 3-99APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-98KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-33Basic GPS OperationChapter 3If none of the conditions above are occurring, then:4.When  is pressed, the waypoint identifier for the current active waypoint will be displayed. àHowever, if the KLN 89BÕsactive waypoint is the Missed Approach Point and the aircraft has flown past the MAP, then the KLN 89B will display the first way- point of the missed approach procedure on the Direct To page.If there is no active waypoint when is pressed, then:5.The Direct To page displays blanks in the waypoint identifier field.  In order for there not to be an active waypoint, there is no  Direct To waypoint and there are no waypoints in Flight Plan 0.3.9.1. INITIATING A DIRECT TO Now that you know the ground rules, letÕs go ahead and try somepractical examples.  First, letÕs say we wanted to fly directly to  Wexford County Airport in Cadillac, Michigan.  Its ICAO identifier is  KCAD.To fly Direct To a waypoint (procedure 1): 1.Press  . The Direct To page isdisplayed (figure 3-100). The cursor will already be on. A waypoint identifier may or may not be displayed, it doesnÕt matter at this point.2.Rotate the right inner knob to select the first character of the desired waypointÕs identifier, in this case, a Ò KÓ (figure 3-101).Remember to enter the ÒKÓ, ÒCÓ, or ÒPÓ prefix for certain airports in  North America, if required (see  section 2.3, ÒICAO IdentifiersÓ).3.Turn the right outer knob one click clockwise to move the flash- ing portion of the cursor over the second character position (figure 3-102).4.Rotate the right inner knob to select the second character of the identifier (figure 3-103).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ,aFigure 3-101APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,\\'aFigure 3-102APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,aFigure 3-100APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,\\'aFigure 3-103Basic GPS Operation3-34Basic GPS OperationChapter 35.Use right outer and inner knobs as in the previous steps until the desired identifier is completely displayed (figure 3-104).6.Press  to display the waypointpage for the selected waypoint (figure 3-105).7.Press  again to approve thedisplayed waypoint page.  The  screen will change to the NAV 1  page, and the selected waypoint will now be the active Direct To waypoint (figure 3-106).àNOTE:In some cases duringapproach operations, the KLN 89B presents a page asking how a way- point is used when the waypoint identifier is entered character by char-acter. When this page is presented, simply choose the desired use of the waypoint (e.g. FAF or MAHP) by moving the cursor with the right outer knob and pressing . Choosing the correct use of the way-point is required to ensure proper waypoint sequencing once the aircraft reaches the waypoint.To fly Direct To a waypoint (procedure 2):1.Select the desired waypoint page (APT, VOR, NDB, INT, or SUP) on the screen (figure 3-107) using one of the three procedures  explained in section 3.7.2.Press  . The Direct To page isdisplayed and it contains the desired waypoint identifier (figure 3-108).3.Press  . The display will revertto the NAV 1 page with the  selected waypoint as the Direct To waypoint.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH , Figure 3-107APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,aaFigure 3-108APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH , Figure 3-105APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-106APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,\\'ˇaFigure 3-104KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-35Basic GPS OperationChapter 3If you get off course and wish to recenter the left/right deviation bar(D-Bar) to proceed to the same waypoint, use the following procedure.To recenter the D-Bar by going direct to the active waypoint: 1.Select a non-waypoint page ( NAV, FPL, CAL, SET, or OTH) onthe screen.2.Press  .  The Direct To page is displayed on the left, contain- ing the active waypoint identifier.3.Press  .àNOTE:If the KLN 89B is in the approach mode and this method isused to center the D-bar when the missed approach point is the active waypoint, then the approach mode will be cancelled and the KLN89B will revert to the approach arm mode.3.9.2. CANCELLING A DIRECT TOThe primary reason for wanting to cancel Direct To operation is to return to flight plan operation which is described later in section 4.2.4 ÒCombining Direct To and Flight Plan OperationÓ.To cancel Direct To operation: 1.Press  .  2.Press  to blank out the way-point identifier field (figure 3-109).3.Press  .3.9.3. WAYPOINT ALERTING FOR DIRECT TO OPERATION Approximately 36 seconds prior to reaching a Direct To waypoint, thearrow preceding the waypoint identifier on the waypoint page for the active waypoint will begin flashing.  This arrow will also be flashing on  any NAV or FPL page displaying the active waypoint identifier.  This  is called Òwaypoint alertingÓ.  If an external waypoint alert (WPT)  annunciator is mounted in the aircraft, this annunciator will begin flashing at the same time.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ,55555aaFigure 3-1093.10. NAVIGATION PAGES As you would expect, the NAV (navigation) pages contain informationrelating specifically to the KLN 89(B)Õs navigation capabilities.  The  KLN 89(B) has four NAV pages.  The procedure for selecting specific  pages, including the NAV pages, was described in section 3.4.1,  ÒPage SelectionÓ.3.10.1.THE NAVIGATION 1 (NAV 1) PAGE  The NAV 1 page is the primarynavigation display, and is shown in  figure 3-110.  In normal flight, you will  probably rely on this page quite a lot. A NAV 1 page displays the following information:Line 1:The active navigation leg.  For Direct To operation this con- sists of the Direct To symbol, XXY Y, followed by the active Direct Towaypoint identifier (figure 3-110).  For  the leg of a flight plan this consists of the ÒfromÓ waypoint identifier and the active ÒtoÓ waypoint identifier     (figure  3-111).  An arrow  YYprecedes theactive waypoint identifier.Line 2:A cyclic field which can either be (1) a course deviation indicator (CDI) that graphically displays left and right deviation from desired course (figure 3-111), (2) The direction to fly to intercept thedesired track and the crosstrack distance (figure 3-112), or (3) the current CDI scale in use. This is a  cyclic field, so you can change back and forth between the three options by turning on the cursor () overthe second line and pressing the button.The CDIÕs vertical bar operates like a navigation deviation needle ona conventional CDI or HSI using VOR/Localizer navigation.  An on-  course indication is displayed when the vertical deviation bar is centered on the triangle in the middle of the CDI.  In en route use,  each dot represents one nautical mile deviation from the desired  track. Different CDI scales are used during terminal and non-preci- sion approach flight with KLN 89B. For now, letÕs talk only about en route operations.

The center triangle also serves asthe CDIÕs TO/FROM indicator andoperates in the same manner as a conventional CDI TO/FROM indica- tor; a triangle pointing up indicates  ÒtoÓ the active waypoint while a  ÒdownÓ triangle (figure 3-114) indicates ÒfromÓ the active waypoint. The word FLAGis displayed over theCDI when the KLN 89(B) is not  usable for navigation (figure 3-115).The numerical crosstrack distancedisplay is especially handy when more than five nautical miles off of course (naturally, you yourself would never deviate more than five nm off  course, but not everyone is as good a pilot as you are!)  If your crosstrack  distance was 13.1 nautical miles left of course, the graphic CDI needle will be pegged on the right side (which doesnÕt tell you much).  But this  presentation will show you exactly how far off course you are (figure 3-116).  When the KLN 89(B)  is not usable for navigation, the crosstrack distance will be dashed out (figure 3-117).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-114APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-115KBGR KAUG2 NMAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH `\\\\MHHH Figure 3-113APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-117APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-116Basic GPS Operation3-38Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Line 3:Magnetic desired track, and magnetic actual track (seeAppendix A for navigation terms).

This condition is most  likely to occur when long distances are involved, and/or you are operating in very northerly or southerly latitudes.  See figure 3-118 for  an example depicting a case like this. The aircraft is somewhere over Georgia, and the active waypoint is KPHX. The bearing to steer is 269¡, and radial is 72¡. Generally, you will want to use bearing (not radial) when long distances are involved.Line 4 also displays the estimated time en route (ETE) from present position to active waypoint.NNKPHX72269Figure 3-118KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-39Basic GPS OperationChapter 33.10.2.THE NAVIGATION 2 (NAV 2) PAGE The NAV 2 pages in figures 3-119 and 3-120 display the aircraftÕs  present position in one of two  formats.  The first line is a cyclic field  which allows you to toggle between formats.  When the NAV 2 page is  first displayed, it defaults to present  position in terms of the radial and distance from a nearby VOR.  You  can change the reference waypoint from the nearby VOR to any  waypoint.To change the NAV 2 page present position reference waypoint:1.With the NAV 2 page on the radial and distance from a  reference waypoint format, turn on the cursor () and move itto the Ref:field (figure 3-121).2.Use the right inner and outer knobs to enter the waypoint you wish to use as a reference.3.Press  .

Otherwise, the last waypoint in your active flight  plan will be the destination.Line 4:The elapsed flight time, which will be the hours and minutessince the departure time.3.10.4.THE NAVIGATION 4 (NAV 4) PAGE  The NAV 4 page is a graphical moving map which offers excellent ÒbirdÕs-eye-viewÓ situational awareness to you as the pilot in com- mand.  This page can show you where you are and where youÕre  headed relative to your active flight plan or leg, your destination way- point(s), the nearby airports and VORs, and even the boundaries of nearby special use airspace!The NAV 4 page (figure 3-124) is alittle bit different than some of the other KLN 89(B) pages.  Instead of  displaying the page type and number (i.e. NAV 4) in the lower left corner of the screen, an additional piece of nav- igation data is displayed here.  WeÕre  willing to bet youÕll know this is the  NAV 4 page anyway, because of its unique graphics.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-123APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-124KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-41Basic GPS OperationChapter 3The left side of the screen displays the distance to go, active way-point identifier, and mode annunciation (either Leg, or the OBSselected course), just like it usually would, but the fourth line is a cyclic field for which you may select:Magnetic Desired Track (degrees)DTK123Groundspeed (knots or kilometers/hour)123ktEstimated Time Enroute (hours:minutes)1:23Crosstrack Correction1.21YYNOTE:Magnetic desired track may only be selected whenKLN 89(B) is in the Leg navigation mode.  When the KLN 89(B) is in  the OBS mode, the Òdesired trackÓ is the same as the OBS selected course displayed on line 3.To change the data displayed in thiscyclic field, simply turn on the cursor (), rotate the right inner knob counterclockwise to position the cur- sor over this field (figure 4-125), and press the button to choose thedesired information.Now we move on to the map display area on the right side of the screen.  In all KLN 89(B) installations there are three common map  orientation formats that may be selected on the NAV 4 page: a True North up display, a desired track up display, or an actual track up dis- play.  In addition, if the KLN 89(B) is interfaced with a source of  heading in a compatible format then a heading up presentation may also be selected.  When the North up display is selected, viewing the  NAV 4 page is like looking at a navigation chart with North at the top. When the desired track up display is selected the NAV 4 page is like looking at a chart that is turned so that your course line is always pointing up.  When the actual track up display is selected, viewing the  NAV 4 page is like looking at a chart that is turned so that the direction the aircraft is tracking over the ground is pointing up.  In a  no-wind condition, actual track is identical to the aircraftÕs heading.CAUTION:  When using the actual track up format it is typical for there to be a slight delay from the time a heading change is made until the correct map orientation is displayed.  Be careful  when using either the desired track up display or the actual track up display to not think that a heading up display is being used.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  (Figure 3-125Basic GPS Operation3-42Basic GPS OperationChapter 3When you are navigating with a flight plan (see section 4.2), the NAV4 page displays the waypoints of the active flight plan (FPL 0) with their waypoint identifiers (figure 3-125). Course lines connect the flight plan waypoints.When operating Direct To a waypointwhich is not in the active flight plan, the direct to waypoint is shown on the map, and although the waypoints of  the active flight plan are still shown onthe screen, they are not connected by course lines (figure 3-126).In the lower left corner of the map dis-play area is the map range scale in nautical miles.  The range scale indi-  cates the distance from the aircraftÕs position to the top of the screen.  You  may select a range scale of 1 NM to  500 NM (2 km to 925 km) with several choices in between by turning on the cursor (), and using the rightinner knob to select the desired range scale.  For example, figure 3-  127 illustrates the results of changing the range scale of the map in figure 3-126 from 60 nautical miles to 30 nautical miles.Additionally, there is a choice called AUTO, for automatic range scal-ing.  This choice is sandwiched between the 1 NM (2 km) scale and  the 500 NM (925 km) scale, such that it is ÒbelowÓ 1 NM (2 km) and ÒaboveÓ 500 NM (925 km).  The AUTO scale factor feature ÒzoomsÓ  the map in and out in a useful way so that you donÕt have to.  Specifically, AUTO chooses the smallest map scale that will display the active waypoint and, if there is one, the waypoint after the activewaypoint.  Choosing the AUTO scale  factor means there is one less item for you to worry about.  This is espe-  cially helpful when conducting non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B.Aside from changing the map range scale, all other customization ofthe map display is done from the menu.  Notice that when you turn on the cursor (), the Menu?fieldappears above the range scale.  Turn  the right outer knob one step counter- clockwise to move the cursor over the Menu?field (figure 3-128) and press.  The menu now Òpops-upÓ on the screen (figure 3-129).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-126APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-127APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 3-128APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  :=\",˘ˇˆ,.CC \"+@,.CC Figure 3-129KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-43Basic GPS OperationChapter 3To select the desired NAV 4 orienta-tion, you must first select the menu,  then use the right outer knob to posi- tion the cursor over the map  orientation field (figure 3-130).  Rotate the right inner knob to display NforNorth up, DTKfor desired track up(figure 3-131), TKfor actual track up, or HDGfor heading up.  The heading up selection is not presented as a choice if heading is not provided to the KLN 89(B).  If the cursor is  located on a field other than the map orientation field, then the DTK, TK,or HDGannunciation is replacedwith the actual value. The  123¡dis-played in figure 3-132 shows how the actual track is displayed when the  cursor is not over the map orientation field.If a heading input is available to the KLN 89(B) then heading up isusually the best map orientation to select.  Otherwise, actual track up  display is usually preferred for use in flight.  However, the track up  display is only usable when the aircraft is moving 2 knots or more so the North up display may be a good choice if you are stationary.Notice that in both the North up format and the desired track up for-mat, the aircraftÕs position is depicted by a diamond.  In the actual  track up format and the heading up format, the aircraftÕs position is depicted by an aircraft symbol.You may choose to have nearby airports, VORs, and special use air-space (SUA) displayed on the moving map!  To do so, use the  pop-up menu by turning on the cursor and selecting Menu?.When the menu is first displayed the cursor will be on the SUA selec-tion field.  Rotate the right inner knob to select  onor off. When SUAsare selected, the five nearest SUAs are displayed.  However, they will not be displayed on map range scales larger than 160 NM (300 km). Special use airspace areas are displayed regardless of your altitude relative to the airspace.  The nearest SUA feature (section 3.8.2) and  the SUA alerting feature (section 3.17) will indicate the altitude limits of the airspace to you. Section 3.17 will also help you understand more about the KLN 89(B) special use airspace features as well as the types of SUA that are included in the KLN 89(B) data base.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  :=\",˘ˇˆ,.CC \"+@,.CC aYFigure 3-130APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  :=\",˘ˇˆ,.CC \"+@,.CC aYFigure 3-131APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  :=\",˘ˇˆ,.CC \"+@,.CC Figure 3-132Basic GPS Operation3-44Basic GPS OperationChapter 3NOTE:Only the outer lateral boundaries are displayed for Class B,Class C, CTA, and TMA airspace.

The example in figure 3-133 shows SUAs and airports having been selected.When the desired selections havebeen made, press the button toremove the menu from the screen (figure 3-134).  Notice that the nearest  airports are depicted with a small +symbol, while the VORs are shown as a small box ().One last item of interest on this page: you may change the activewaypoint to any of the flight plan waypoints without having to leave the map display.  This is done by pulling the right inner knob to the  ÒoutÓ or ÒscanÓ position.  This will cause the identifier for the active  waypoint to be displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen(figure 3-135).  The waypoint  displayed in this area will be the default waypoint when ispressed.  By turning the right inner  knob it is possible to scan through the waypoints of the active flight plan  (FPL 0).  Turning the knob clockwise  will scan through the waypoints in sequence until the end of the flight plan is reached.  Turning the knob counter-clockwise will scan  through the active flight plan in reverse order until the beginning of the flight plan is reached.  Pushing the right inner knob back to the  ÒinÓ position will remove this text from the map display area.The following hints will make using the NAV 4 page more enjoyable.¥It is easy to clutter the display with so much data that it is unus- able.  Select a range scale that allows an uncluttered  presentation of the chosen SUAs, VORs, and airports.  Or,  select another combination of these from the menu.

WAYPOINT PAGES NOTE:Each of the waypoint page types includes a cyclic field whichdisplays present magnetic bearing to or magnetic heading from the waypoint.  Due to Ògreat circleÓ courses and magnetic variation  differences between present position and the active waypoint, the To bearing and From radial may not be exactly 180¡different from each  other.

That is, a frequency may be used only within a cer-  tain range of radials from a designated reference location.  The  format for displaying the sectorization is to show the frequency first, followed by the identifier of the associated reference point, followed next by the associated altitude restrictions.

ALTITUDE PAGES The ALT (altitude) pages are used to control and display most of the altitude-related functions of the KLN 89(B), including minimum safe alti-  tudes and vertical navigation (VNAV).  The ALT pages are accessed  by pressing the button.  The first time the  button is pressed,the ALT 1 page is displayed (figure 3-169).  If the  button is pressedagain while the ALT 1 page is dis-  played, the display changes to the ALT 2 page.  Pressing  a third time goes back to the page which you were on before you changed to the ALT pages.NOTE:For a detailed discussion of the ALT 2 page, see section 4.4,ÒAdvisory VNAV OperationÓ.The ALT 1 page is used to set the current barometric pressure or Òbaro settingÓ.  Since all encoding altimeters and some air data computers  output pressure altitude, it is often required that you manually input the  proper baro setting in order to get accurate altitude functions.  The KLN  89(B) functions which use the altitude input are special use airspace  (SUA) alerting, altitude alerting, and vertical navigation (VNAV).  It is a  good idea to update the altimeter baro setting on the ALT 1 page each  time you make a change to the aircraftÕs altimeter setting.To Change the Baro Setting: 1.Press  .  The ALT 1 page will be displayed with the cursor over the altimeter baro setting field (figure 3-169).NOTE: The SET 8 page (figure 3-170)is used to set the unit of measure for  various parameters. The altimeter barometric setting can be set to inches of Mercury (Ò), millibars (mB), or hec-  topascals (hP). Altitude, airport elevation, and runway lengths can be set to feet (ft) or meters (m). Finally, distances and velocities can be set to nautical miles (nm) and knots (kt) or kilometers (km) and kilometers/hour (k/h). To change a unit of mea- sure: select the SET 8 page; turn on the cursor (CRSR) and move it  over the desired unit of measure using the right outer knob; turn the right inner knob to select the desired unit of measure;  and turn the cur-  sor off again. This format for the SET 8 page applies to ORS 02 software. ORS 01 software only allows the selection of barometric set-  ting units.

This altitude is derived by Jeppesen for sectors which are  one degree of latitude by one degree of longitude in size.  One degree  of latitude is 60 nautical miles.  One degree of longitude is 60 nautical  miles at the equator and progressively less than 60 nautical miles as one travels away from the equator.  One degree of longitude is approx-  imately 50 nautical miles at the southern most parts of the U.S. and is  approximately 40 nautical miles at the northern most parts of the U.S.  The MSA altitude information is contained in the data base and is  updateed when the data base cartridge is updated.The minimum safe altitude (MSA) provides Òreference pointÓ clearance within these one degree latitude by one degree longitude sectors. Jeppesen defines a reference point as Òa natural (Peak, Knoll, Hill, etc.)  or man-made (Tower, Stack, Tank, Building, etc.) objectÓ. Jeppesen states the following about the Grid Minimum Off-Route altitude:  ÒGrid  MORA values clear all reference points by 1000 feet in areas where  the highest reference points are 5000 feet MSL or lower. MORA values  clear all reference points by 2000 feet in areas where the highest refer-  ence points are 5001 feet MSL or higherÓ.  The KLN 89(B) displays  dashes for areas outside the data base coverage area or for areas where the Grid MORA is not defined.Line 4 displays the Minimum Enroute Safe Altitude (ESA).IMPORTANT:When the KLN 89(B) is in the Leg mode, the minimum enroute safe altitude is the highest MSA sector altitude from the pre-  sent position to the active waypoint, then to the destination waypoint along the active flight plan.

VIEWING AND SETTING THE DATE AND TIME The KLN 89(B) system time and date should seldom, if ever, require updating because they are automatically updated when at least one satellite is received.  In addition, the KLN 89(B) contains an internal  battery powered calendar/clock to keep system time and date when the unit is not being used.  You will normally check to make sure the KLN  89(B) is set to the correct  time and date shortly after you turn the unit  on while you verify the Self Test Page.  You can, however, also check  the time and date on the Setup (SET) 2 page anytime you desire. There are several pages as well as some internal functions of the KLN 89(B), such as magnetic variation and proper use of data base informa- tion, that depend on having the proper time and date.NOTE:You will not be able to update the time or date if the KLN 89(B) is receiving a time and date from a satellite.To set the date on the SET 2 page: 1.Select the SET 2 page (figure 3- 173).2.Turn on the cursor.  The cursor will be over the entire date field (figure 3-174).3.Select the correct day of the month with the right inner knob.4.Move the flashing part of the cursor to the month field (middle three dashes) with the right outer knob, and select the proper month  (figure 3-175).5.Move the flashing part of the cursor to the tens digit of the year  field, and select the proper number (figure 3-176).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-175APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-173APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-174KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-61Basic GPS OperationChapter 36.Repeat step 5 for the ones digit of the year field.7.Press  to start the KLN 89(B)using the newly entered date (figure 3-177).To set the time on the SET 2 page: 1.Select the SET 2 page if it is not already selected.2.Turn on the cursor and move it to the time zone field (figure 3-178).3.Change the time zone with the right inner knob, if desired   (figure  3-179).

This includes which satellites are being tracked, the  satellitesÕ health, the signal strength for each of these satellites, the elevation of each satellite above the horizon, the azimuth of each  satellite referenced to your present position, the estimated position error, and the present GPS-derived altitude.The GPS receiver in the KLN 89(B) is capable of using signals fromup to eight satellites to determine its position.  A valid position may be  determined using as few as four satellites alone or three satellites with a valid electronic altitude input.  However, four satellites alone or  three satellites with an altitude input do not necessarily ensure that navigation can take place.  The satellites must be positioned relative  to your location such that sufficient ÒgeometryÓ exists to determine an accurate position. The satellite constellation geometry is continually changing as each satellite, ÒrisesÓ, travels across the sky, andeventually ÒsetsÓ relative to your position.  The GPS satellites are not in geosynchronous orbits positioned over the same spot on earth at all times like some television communication satellites with which you may be familiar.  Rather, the GPS satellites are in orbits that allow  them to circle the earth about two times each day.A representative OTH 1 page is shown in figure 3-183.  The OTH 1  page displays the GPS receiver state and the systemÕs estimate of the posi-tion error expressed in nautical miles or kilometers.The GPS state is indicated on line 1.

Next, the receiver collects data from its own  memory to determine which satellites should be visible.  After  completing the initialization process the receiver begins the  acquisition process.  During this time, the visible satellites are being  acquired and data is obtained from them.The transition state indicates an adequate number of satellites fornavigation has been acquired and is being tracked but no position data can yet be produced.Normal navigation is indicated by a NAV, NAV A, or NAV DGPSstate.  NAV Aindicates that the altitude input is being used in the position solution.  NAV Dindicates that besides calculation position,the receiver is collecting and storing in its memory additional data from the satellites (called ephemeris and almanac data).Line 2 of the OTH 1 page displays the present GPS-derived altitude,that is, the altitude that is being indicated by the GPS position solution.WARNING: Do not use the GPS-derived altitude for navigation. Due to Selective Availability position degradation and other fac-  tors, the GPS altitude is normally 300 feet or more in error, which is unacceptable for vertical navigation.Lines 3 and 4 of the OTH 1 page dis-play the KLN 89(B)Õs estimatedposition error.  The KLN 89(B) Õs posi-tion error depends upon such factors as the number of satellites being received, the strength of the GPS sig- nals, and the geometry of the  satellites presently being used for navigation.Figures 3-184, 3-185 and 3-186 showa representative example of a set of OTH 2 pages.  There will be three  OTH 2 pages if more than six satellites are being received as in this example.

A * symbol to the right of the satellite  number indicates this particular satellite is not presently being  tracked by the receiver.NOTE:At some times, you may desire to deselect certain satellites ifyou know them to be inaccurate, so that they are not used to deter- mine the GPS position. Should a satellite be inaccurate, it could cause a RAIM failure, rendering the system unusable for primary IFR  navigation. To deselect a specific satellite, turn on the cursor ()and move it over the desired SV number (figure 3-187). Turn the right inner knob to deselect (or reselect) the desired satellite.¥The satelliteÕs ÒhealthÓ (Hlt) is indicated to the right of the satellitenumber.  The health of the satellite can be described as  GdforGood, Wkfor Weak, and Bdfor Bad.   Dsindicates the satellitewas deselected by the pilot.  Fdindicates the receiver detected afault and excluded that satellite.¥The signal strength (Sg) for each satellite is displayed next andindicates the signal strength for each satellite in the range of 0 (zero) to 9 (nine). The higher the value the stronger the signal.¥The elevation (El) above the hori-zon for each satellite is provided  in the right column and will range from 5¡to 90¡.¥The local azimuth ( Az) of thesatellite relative to your present position, referenced to true north (rather than magnetic north).

REMOTE MOUNTED ANNUNCIATORS The KLN 89(B) has outputs capable of driving two remote annunciator lights: waypoint alert and message.  Although these annunciators are  optional, it is desirable to have them mounted in the  pilotÕs normal scan area so that these annunciatorsare easily seen.  A typical annunciator is shown in  figure 3-197; however, actual annunciation abbrevi- ations and configurations may be different.The remote waypoint alert annunciator is on whenever waypointalerting is occurring.  See sections 3.9.3,  ÒWaypoint Alerting for DirectTo OperationÓ and 4.2.2, ÒTurn Anticipation and Waypoint AlertingÓ.The remote message annunciator is on whenever the messageprompt  is on.

It  gives you a digital readout of the voltage supplied to your avionics, down to tenths of volts.  You will find this feature valuable as an extra  layer of security in cases of electrical or charging system problems.A voltage alert feature is also available on this page, to warn you ofan electrical system problem, regardless of whether you are viewing the SET 10 page or not.  It is set up so that the avionics bus voltage  must drop below the alert limit for a certain length of time.  This time  delay is so that brief power interruptions don\\'t trigger the voltage alert.The alert voltage and the alert delay are set at the time of installationand stored in the KLN 89(B) configuration module.  As the pilot, your  two options are to have the voltage alert disabled, or to have it enabled with the predefined voltage and time delay values.To enable the voltage alert feature: 1.Select the SET 10 page (figure 3-198) and turn on the cursor ().2.Turn the right inner knob to enable the alert feature.  The  alert voltage and alert delay will be displayed on lines 2 and 3 (figure 3-199).3.Turn off the cursor ( ).If the avionics bus voltage dropsbelow the alert voltage for the speci- fied delay time, the message*Low Bus VoltageCheck Charging Systemwill be displayed.  This message may be indicative of a problem with the aircraft\\'s charging system.

You may desire to turn off some of the aircraft\\'s electrical devices which are non-essential for your particular phase(s) of flight, so that the battery will not discharge as quickly.Appropriate alert voltage and alert delays will vary from aircraft to air- craft.  If your KLN 89(B) is frequently giving you this alert message, it  may become a nuisance, and you may desire to have your  Honeywell Service Center adjust the voltage alert parameters.3.17.SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE ALERTING The KLN 89(B) data base contains the location of areas of special  use airspace (SUA).  The types of SUA areas stored in the data base  and the abbreviations used to denote these areas are the following:Class BCL BClass CCL CControl Area (used outside USA)CTATerminal Area (used outside USA)TMAAlert AreaALRTCaution AreaCAUTDanger AreaDNGRMilitary Operations AreaMOAProhibited AreaPROHRestricted AreaRESTTraining AreaTRNGWarning AreaWARNTerminal Radar Service AreaTRSAThe KLN 89(B) will normally alert youprior to entering one of these areas with a message prompt.  When the  Message page is viewed it will display Airspace Alert and will also display the name and type of the special use airspace (figure 3-200).  If the special  use airspace is a Class B, Class C, CTA, or TMA, the message page will also instruct you to press the but-ton if you wish to see the Airport 5 page (airport communications) for the primary airport so that the correct communications frequency may be determined (figure 3-201).Basic GPS Operation3-68Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-200APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 3-201NOTE:In addition to the message page messages that alert you tospecial use airspace, the KLN 89(B) can also display the five nearest areas of SUA.  It will even give you the direction and distance to the  nearest edge of the SUA.  See section 3.8.2 for more details.The SUA alert feature is three dimensional.  The SUA areas are stored in the KLN 89(B) data base with regard to altitude when the actual SUA altitude limitations are charted in terms of mean sea level (MSL).  Therefore, if you are flying either above or below an SUA  area you wonÕt be inconvenienced with nuisance alert messages.However, if the actual lower limit of an SUA is charted in terms of an altitude above ground level (AGL), then it is stored in the KLN 89(B) as all altitude below the upper limit of the SUA.  If the actual upper  limit of an SUA is charted in terms of AGL, it is stored in the KLN 89(B) as ÒunlimitedÓ.If the altitude input to the KLN 89(B) is pressure altitude from an alti- tude encoder or air data computer, then you must manually update the KLN 89(B) with an altimeter setting (baro correction in order to receive accurate SUA alerting. You may easily update the altimeter setting by pressing the button todisplay the Altitude 1 (ALT 1) page  (figure 3-202) The right inner knob is used to change the altimeter setting. When the setting is complete, press twice to return to the page previ-ously in view.CAUTION:  Failure to keep the altimeter baro setting updated will result in inaccurate special use airspace alerting. If this fea-  ture is used, it is a good idea to update the altimeter baro setting on the ALT 1 page each time you make a change to an aircraftÕs  altimeter setting.NOTE:If there is no altitude input to the KLN 89(B), all altitudes willbe regarded as being within the boundary of the SUA area.Only the outer lateral boundaries are stored for Class B, Class C, CTA, and TMA airspace.  These SUA areas are stored as  ÒcylindersÓof airspace so all altitudes below the upper limit of these areas are considered to be in the SUA.The message prompt for a special use airspace alert will occur whenthe aircraftÕs position is at a point such that a projection of the air- craftÕs existing track over the ground is approximately 10 minutesfrom penetrating the outer boundary of one of these areas.  It will alsoKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-69Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH \"!;!#L  Figure 3-202occur if the aircraft iswithin approximately two nautical miles of one of these areas even if the aircraftÕs projected trackover the ground wonÕtactually penetrate the SUA area (figure 3-203). If one of the SUA areas is penetrated, another message will state: Inside SUA.The SUA alert feature may be disabled (or enabled) on the Setup 7(SET 7) page, shown in figure 3-204. Select the SET 7 page, turn on the cursor ().  The right inner knob is used to choose between SUA ALERTENABLEDand SUA ALERT DIS-ABLED.If the SUA alert feature has beenenabled, the KLN 89(B) allows you to select a vertical buffer on the SET 7 page in order to provide an additional layer of protection from inadvertently entering an SUA.  To select a vertical  buffer, make sure the SUA alert fea- ture has been enabled.  Turn on the  cursor () (figure 3-205) and thenuse the right inner knob to select the buffer (figure 3-206).  The buffer may  be selected in one hundred foot or ten meter increments.  After the desired  selection has been made, turn the off.The vertical buffer serves to ÒstretchÓ the SUA area in both directions (up and down) by the selected buffer altitude.  For example, let Õs sayyou have selected a buffer of 1,000 feet and the actual SUA area  exists from 5,000 feet MSL to 12,000 feet MSL.  In this case you will  receive SUA alert messages if you fly at any altitude between 4,000 and 13,000 feet MSL.Basic GPS Operation3-70Basic GPS OperationChapter 3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 3-204APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   ˛˛#Figure 3-205APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   ˛$˛Figure 3-20610 MIN2 MILESFigure 3-203CAUTION:  It is the pilotÕs responsibility to avoid those areas of special use airspace where ATC clearance to penetrate is required but has not been obtained.  The KLN 89(B)Õs special  use airspace alert is only a tool to assist the pilot and should  never be relied upon as the sole means of avoiding these areas.àNOTE:Special Use Airspace alerting is disabled when the KLN89B is in the approach arm or approach active modes.3.18  SAMPLE TRIPWeÕve talked a lot about the features of the KLN 89(B), and now itÕstime to put those features to work for us and try a sample trip!  Our  trip will be from Adams field (KLIT) in Little Rock, Arkansas to Mueller  Municipal airport (KAUS) in Austin, Texas.  The weather is perfect  and we decide to make trip VFR and fly direct to Austin.3.18.1  PRE-DEPARTURE  1. Apply power to the KLN 89(B) by turning the power knob to the ON position.2.Verify that the information on the Self Test and Initialization pages is correct, including the time and date.  Enter the altimeter  baro setting.  Position the cursor over  Ok?and press toapprove the Initialization page.3. Read the Data Base page and acknowledge it by pressing  .4. The APT 5 page for Adams field ( KLIT), which shows the com-munications frequencies, is now displayed on the screen since KLITwas the active waypoint when you last removed power fromthe  KLN 89(B).  The first APT 5 page indicates that the ATIS fre-  quency is 125.65 MHz, the pre-taxi clearance delivery frequency is 118.95 MHz, and the ground control frequency is 121.90 MHz. After listening to ATIS, we contact clearance delivery for our  clearance out of the Little Rock Class C airspace.  Next, we give  ground control a call and receive our taxi clearance.5. By this time the KLN 89(B) has reached a NAV ready status.  We can verify this by turning to the NAV 2 page.  It shows a valid  present position, in this case 3.8 nautical miles on the 320 degree radial from Little Rock (LIT) VOR.6. Press to bring up the Direct To page.

Press  . The APT 1 page for Mueller Municipal is now dis- played on the screen.8.Press  again to approve the waypoint page.  The NAV 1 page is now displayed.  The NAV 1 page indicates it is 384  nautical miles to Austin and that the bearing is 225 degrees. After take-off, the NAV 1 page will also display groundspeed and estimated time en route.3.18.2 EN ROUTE  1. We depart from runway 36 at Little Rock and are told to  Òmaintainrunway heading.Ó  After several radar vectors for traffic avoidancewe are finally cleared on course. The D-Bar indicates that the  radar vectors have taken us north of the original course and we decide to proceed Direct To Austin from our present position. To recenter the D-Bar, press , and then press .2. In order to determine the minimum enroute safe altitude (ESA) for our flight, you view the ALT 1 page by pressing the button. It indicates an ESA of 4300 feet for the trip and a minimum safe altitude for our present position of 3400 feet.3. After departure control has directed  Òsquawk 1200, frequencychange approved,Ó you decide it would be a good idea to obtain VFR flight following. To obtain the frequency for Center, press the button, move the cursor to the CTR?selection, andpress .  The KLN 89(B) indicates that for our position, we should be able to contact Memphis Center on 118.85 MHz.4. WeÕve only flown about 100 nautical miles, but we begin wonder-ing where we would go if an engine suddenly started running rough.  We decide to use the KLN 89(B) to determine where the  nearest airports are from our present location. To view the near-  est airports press , and then press . The nearest airport isHope Municipal (M18) which is eight nautical miles from our posi-tion on a bearing to the airport of 11 degrees.  You now rotate the right inner knob to view the other APT pages for Hope Municipal. We learn, for example, that it is located in Hope, Arkansas, and  has two hard surface runways that are each 5500 feet in length. By pulling the right inner knob to the ÒoutÓ position, you may now scan clockwise through the remaining eight airports in the nearest airport list.Basic GPS Operation3-72Basic GPS OperationChapter 35. For the majority of the en route portion of the flight, you select the NAV 4 pageÕs moving map display.  Pressing the right  button, you select the 30 nautical mile range scale using the right inner knob.  Moving the cursor to  Menu?And pressing brings up the display menu on the screen.  You then use the right knobs to select APT:onand SUA:onso that nearby airports andspecial use airspace (SUA) are shown on the moving map display.  While the menu is displayed, select the track up map  orientation (TKcc) as well,  Pressing the  button againremoves the menu from the screen.6. Since it is a good idea to not rely on just one navigation source, you suggest we cross check the KLN 89(B) position against other equipment in the aircraft.  The NAV 2 page indicates we are  presently located on the Texarkana (TXK) VOR 68 degree radialat a distance of 19 nautical miles.  By tuning our NAV receiver  and DME to TXK, we are able to confirm that this is the correct position.3.18.3  TERMINAL AREA  1. About 50 nautical miles from Austin Õs Mueller airport we startpreparing four our arrival.  Viewing the APT 5 page for  KAUSyou determine that the ATIS frequency is 119.20 MHz and tower is 121.00 MHz.2. A few minutes later, the message prompt begins flashing.  When you press , the message page advises Airspace Alert -Austin CL C - Below 4600 ft - See KAUS freq-Press CLR.The Special Use Airspace Alert feature has determined that you are within 10 minutes of penetrating the Austin Class C airspace. When you press and view the APT 5 page for KAUS, yousee that the Class C airspace frequencies are sectorized.  You  determine from the APT 5 page that the proper frequency to use  is 124.90 MHz since we are Northeast of Austin and 124.90 MHz is the appropriate frequency to use from 3 degrees to 170 degrees.  You turn to the NAV 4 page so that we can see the  outer boundary of the Austin Class C airspace relative to our location and route.3. After you call Austin approach control for clearance into the Class C airspace, you view the rest of the APT pages for KAUS to determine the field elevation and available runways.4. After landing, the KLN 89(B) is turned off either by rotating the KLN 89(B) power knob to OFF, or with the avionics master switch if one is installed.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideBasic GPS Operation 3-73Basic GPS OperationChapter 3Basic GPS Operation3-74Basic GPS OperationChapter 3This page intentionally left blank 4.ADVANCED GPS OPERATION 4.1. CREATING AND MODIFYING FLIGHT PLANS The following rules and considerations apply to KLN 89(B) flightplans:¥The KLN 89(B) is capable of storing in its memory 25 flight plansplus an active flight plan.¥Each of the flight plans may contain up to 20 waypoints.  The waypoints may consist of any combination of published waypoints from the data base or user created waypoints. The  active flight plan may contain up to 35 waypoints if it includes  approach and SID/STAR waypoints.¥The flight plans are numbered 0 through 25 (FPL 0, FPL 1, FPL2, . . . , FPL 25).¥The active flight plan is alwaysFPL 0.  The standard procedure is to create a flight plan using one of the flight plans numbered as FPL 1, FPL 2, etc. When one of these numbered flight plans is activated, it becomes FPL 0, the active flight plan. This PilotÕsGuide will refer to FPL 0 as the  Òactive flight plan Ó and FPL 1 through FPL 25 as the Ònumbered flight plans.Ó  If desired, a flight plan can be created directly in the active flight plan. This avoids creating the flight plan in a numbered flight plan and then having to activate it. The disadvantage is that if a numbered flight plan is subsequently made active, the one programmed directly into FPL 0 will be lost.¥Modifications may be made to FPL 0 without affecting the way itis stored as a numbered flight plan.¥Unless Direct To operation is being used, the active flight plan(FPL 0) must contain at least two waypoints.  Otherwise, the  KLN 89(B) navigation system will be flagged.4.1.1. CREATING A FLIGHT PLAN  A flight plan for a flight from Lakefront airport in New Orleans, LA to St. Petersburg/Clearwater, FL  International airport will be used as an  example of how to create a flight plan.  The waypoints making up the  flight plan are:  KNEW(Lakefront airport), GPT(Gulfport VOR), SJI(Semmes VOR),  CEW(Crestview VOR), MAI(Marianna VOR), TLH(Tallahassee VOR), CTY(Cross City VOR), and  KPIE(St. Petersburg/Clearwater International airport).KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-1Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4To create a flight plan:1.Select the flight plan (FPL) pages with the right outer knob.  2.Select a flight plan page (preferably other than FPL 0) which does not contain a flight plan (figure 4-1).  If all of the flight  plan pages contain flight plans, refer to section 4.1.6,  ÒDeletingFlight PlansÓ.3.Turn on the cursor ( ).NOTE:The KLN 89(B) flight plan operation is designed so that thefirst waypoint in the flight plan should always be the departure point. Remember to enter the K, P, or Cprefix for certain airports in theUnited States, Alaska (some, but not all cases), or Canada, respec- tively.  See section 2.3, ÒICAO IdentifiersÓ.4.Use the right inner knob to select the first character of the depar- ture waypoint identifier (figure 4-2).  If you have set the default  first waypoint character to Konthe SET 5 page, you will just  need one turn clockwise (see section 3.4.2, ÒData EntryÓ)5.Turn the right outer knob to move the flashing part of the cursor over the second character, then select the desired character.6.Use the above procedure to select the entire identifier for the first waypoint (figure 4-3).7.Press  .  A waypoint page for the identifier just entered will be displayed on the screen      (figure 4-4).  If a mistake was made and  the wrong waypoint identifier was entered, press and beginagain.  If no mistake was made  but the waypoint identifier just  entered isnÕt in the data base, apage allowing creation of a user defined waypoint will appear on the screen.  Refer to section 4.6 for instructions on how to create  a user-defined waypoint.Advanced GPS Operation4-2Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-1APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-2APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  \\' ˆˆ Figure 4-3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-48.Press  again to approve thewaypoint page being displayed. The cursor will move automatically to the second waypoint position (figure 4-5).NOTE:A small number of waypoints are stored in the data base asÒfly-overÓ waypoints. These waypoints are associated with SID/STAR procedures. ÒFly-overÓ means that, for some reason, the governing agencies have decided that it is important to fly directly over the way- point instead of being able to Òcut the cornerÓ by using turn anticipation (see section 4.2.2). In these cases the KLN 89(B) willpresent a waypoint type identification page (figure 4-6). Simply select the way in which the waypoint is intended to be used with the right outer knob and press . If the SID/STARchoice is selected, the KLN 89(B) will disable turn anticipation for that way-point (if previously enabled). The KLN 89(B) will enable turn anticipation after the waypoint has been passed (if turn anticipation was previously enabled). If En Routeis selected, then normal turnanticipation occurs.9.Use the same procedure to enter the rest of the waypoints in the flight plan (figure 4-7).  If the flight  plan consists of three or more waypoints, the waypoints will automatically scroll as necessary to allow entry of the next waypoint.10.When all of the waypoints have been entered in the flight plan, the right outer knob may be rotated to move the cursor up and down and manually ÒscrollÓ through the waypoints making up this flight plan.  This is useful if the flight plan contains four or more  waypoints since not all of the waypoints can be displayed at one time.  When the right outer knob is rotated counterclockwise, the  cursor may be positioned over Use?.  If there are more than three waypoints in the flight plan, the first two waypoints will then be displayed followed by the last waypoint in the flight plan.  Rotate the right outer knob to move the cursor and manually  scroll to see the missing intermediate waypoints.11.Turn off the cursor ( ).

VIEWING DISTANCE AND DESIRED TRACK BETWEEN  STORED FLIGHT PLAN WAYPOINTSThe stored flight plan (FPL 1-25) pages have a field to the right ofeach waypoint in the flight plan.  This field may be used to display the  cumulative distance (Dis) to each waypoint or the magnetic desiredtrack (Dtk) from the previous waypoint.If you have more than three waypoints in the stored flight plan, youmay wish to view flight data for waypoints which are not displayed on the screen.  If this is the case, turn on the cursor ( ) and use theright outer knob to scroll down the flight plan until the waypoint of interest is on the screen.This display will default to the distance presentation at power-on.The area in the upper right hand area of the screen is a cyclic field.To cycle between distance and desired track display on a num- bered flight plan page:1.Turn on the cursor ( ); it will come up over the cyclic field, which in this case is displaying distance (Dis) in nautical miles orkilometers (figure 4-8).2.Press  .

ADDING A WAYPOINT TO A FLIGHT PLAN  A waypoint may be added to any flight plan containing fewer than 20waypointsTo add a waypoint to a flight plan: 1.Turn on the cursor with the  button.2.With the outer knob, position the cursor over the waypoint identi- fier which you desire to follow the waypoint being added. Another way to think of this is to position the cursor over the location in the flight plan you wish the new waypoint to be added. For example, if  SJI is presently the second waypoint in the flightplan and you wish to insert GPTin the number 2 position in frontof SJI, move the cursor over SJI(figure 4-14).3.Use the inner knob to enter the first character of the waypoint  being inserted.  As you begin to  turn the knob, the existing  waypoint in this position automatically jumps down to the next position.

OPERATING FROM THE ACTIVE FLIGHT PLAN 4.2.1.GENERAL PROCEDURES Everything you have learned in this PilotÕs Guide thus far isapplicable to using the KLN 89(B) for flight plan operation.  The  following rules and considerations apply for flight plan operation while the KLN 89(B) is in the Leg mode:¥Always verify that you are viewing the active flight plan page(FPL 0) and not one of the other numbered flight plan pages.¥The active leg of the flight plan is designated with a symbol. A leg is defined as the course line between a pair of waypoint (a ÒfromÓ waypoint and a  ÒtoÓ waypoint).  The head of the arrow is positioned to the left of and points to the active ÒtoÓ waypoint.  In figure 4-28, SLC (Salt Lake City VOR) is the ÒtoÓ waypoint.  The tail of the symbol is positioned to the left of the  ÒfromÓ way- point.  KPVU (Provo Municipal) is the  ÒfromÓ waypoint in figure 4-28.  The symbol is not dis-  played unless the KLN 89(B) is actually receiving GPS signals suitable for navigation.(Note:Ifthe unit is in the take-home mode, it has been ÒtrickedÓ into thinking it is receiving signals and there- fore the symbol can be displayed).Also, the symbol will not be displayed if Direct To navigation is occurring and the Direct To waypoint is not in FPL 0.  If in doubt as to whether or not  Direct To operation is occurring,  view the NAV 1 page.  If the top  line shows the symbol (figure  4-29) instead of a  ÒfromÓ waypoint (figure 4-30), then Direct To navi-  gation is occurring.

To view inter- mediate waypoints, turn the cursor on and use the right outer knob to manually scroll through all of the waypoints, as desired.If scrolling is performed all the way to the end of the flight plan, a blank waypoint position will exist so that a waypoint may be added to the end of the flight plan  (figure 4-32).4.2.2.TURN ANTICIPATION AND WAYPOINT ALERTING Prior to reaching a waypoint in the active flightplan, the KLN 89(B) will provide navigation along a curved path segment to ensure a smooth transi- tion between two adjacent legs in the flight plan. That is, the CDI or HSI left/right deviation will be referenced to the dashed line in figure 4-33.  This  feature is called turn anticipation.  The transition  course is based upon the aircraftÕs actual ground-speed and the amount of course angle change between the two legs.  The KLN 89(B) automati-  cally sequences to the next leg after passing the midpoint  in the transition segment.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-9Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-31APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-32WPT 1WPT 2WPT 3Figure 4-33Approximately 20 seconds prior to thebeginning of turn anticipation, the  arrow preceding the active waypoint identifier will begin flashing on the FPL 0 page and on any Navigation page or waypoint page displaying the active waypoint identifier (figures 4-34 and 4-35). This is called ÒwaypointalertingÓ.  If an external waypoint alert annunciator is mounted in the aircraft, this annunciator will begin flashing at the same time.To utilize the turn anticipation feature, start the turn transition to thenext leg in the flight plan at the very beginning of turn anticipation. This occurs when the external waypoint alert annunciator stops flashing and goes on steady.  At this time, the KLN 89(B) will notify  you with a message on the Message page of the new desired track to select on your HSI or CDI.*Adj Nav Crs to 123¡A message will not be given if the change in desired track (coursechange) is less than 5¡.The desired track (DTK) displayed on the NAV 1 page and optionallyon the NAV 4 page also changes to the value for the next leg at the begin- ning of turn anticipation. Turn  anticipation becomes inactive when transition to the next leg has been made.If desired, turn anticipation may bedisabled (or enabled) on the Setup  (SET) 4 page by pressing the button and then rotating the right inner knob to change back and forth between ENABLED(figure 4-36) and DISABLED(figure 4-37).  If turn anticipation is disabled, navigation is provided all the way to the way- point, and waypoint alerting occurs approximately 36 seconds prior to actually reaching the waypoint.Advanced GPS Operation4-10Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-34APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-35APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-36APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-374.2.3.VIEWING THE WAYPOINT PAGES FOR THE ACTIVE  FLIGHT PLAN WAYPOINTSThe waypoint pages for each of thewaypoints in the active flight plan may be easily displayed by selecting the Active (ACT) Waypoint page type. When the ACT page type is first selected, the waypoint page for the active waypoint will be displayed (fig- ure 4-38).  The location of the  waypoint in the flight plan (waypoint  1, waypoint 2, etc.) is annunciated with a number to the left of the identifier.  In addition, an arrow to the left of the waypoint number designates the active waypoint.  If there  is a letter to the far right of the identifier, it designates the type of way-point: I= intersection, U=user-defined waypoint. If the waypoint is an airport, the airport elevation is  displayed here. If the waypoint is a VOR or an NDB, the navaid  frequency is displayed in this area (figure 4-39).To view the waypoints in the flightplan that are not the active way- point:1.Pull the right inner knob to the ÒoutÓ position and turn it to view each of the rest of the waypoints in the order they are contained in the flight plan (figure 4-40).2.Once the desired waypoint is found, the right inner knob may be pushed back to the ÒinÓ position and rotated to display any of the other waypoint pages for that waypoint (figure 4-41).3.Pulling the knob back out will allow further scanning of the waypoints in the active flight plan.4.2.4.COMBINING DIRECT TO AND FLIGHT PLAN  OPERATIONIt is very common when using flight plan operation to use the DirectTo function to proceed directly to a waypoint which exists in the active flight plan.  For example, after takeoff on an IFR flight plan, it is KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-11Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-38APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-39APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-40APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-41common to receive vectors in the terminal area and then be given aclearance direct to the first point in the flight plan that was filed.  The  KLN 89(B), as an advisory navigation source,  makes this kind of  operation very easy to accomplish.  Whenever you do a Direct To  operation to a waypoint which is in the active flight plan (FPL 0), the system will provide navigation to the waypoint and then automatically resume navigation along the flight plan when the Direct To waypoint is reached.  Waypoints which exist prior to the Direct To waypoint in  the active flight plan are bypassed.  Of course, the active flight plan  will never be resumed if the Direct To operation is to a waypoint which is not in the active flight plan.Any of the several methods previouslydescribed for initiating Direct To oper- ation may be used, although the one below is the easiest for this applica- tion.To fly direct to a waypoint in theactive flight plan (FPL 0):1.Select the FPL 0 page.  2.Turn on the cursor ( ) and usethe left outer knob to position the cursor over the desired waypoint  (figure 4-42).3.Press  .  The display will change to the Direct To Page (figure 4-43), with the identifier of  the selected waypoint.4.Press  to approve the DirectTo.  The NAV 1 page will be  displayed (figure 4-44) reflecting the new active waypoint.5.If you now turn back to the FPL 0 page, you will see that the active waypoint is now preceded by an arrow only, instead of the symbol (figure 4-45).  This is  because there is no ÒfromÓ waypoint in the flight plan.If it is desired to cancel the Direct To operation prior to reaching theDirect To waypoint in order to proceed along the flight plan leg, press , then press , then .q q&&Advanced GPS Operation4-12Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 4-42APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-43APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-44APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-454.2.5.VIEWING DISTANCE, ETE, ETA, OR DESIRED TRACK  TO FLIGHT PLAN WAYPOINTSThe active flight plan (FPL 0) page has a data field to the right ofeach waypoint in the flight plan.  This field may be used to display the  cumulative distance (Dis) from the present position to each waypoint, the estimated time en route (ETE), the estimated time of arrival(ETA), for which the time zone abbreviation is displayed, or the mag- netic desired track (Dtk) between each waypoint.If you have more than four waypoints in FPL 0, you may wish to viewflight data for waypoints which are not displayed on the screen.  If this is the case, turn on the cursor () and use the right outer knob toscroll down the flight plan until the waypoint of interest is on the screen.This display will default to the dis-tance (Dis) presentation at power-on(figure 4-45).  The area in the upper  right hand corner of the screen is a cyclic field, which means that . . .To cycle between distance, ETE,ETA, and desired track on the FPL  0 page:1.Turn on the cursor ( ); it willcome up over the cyclic field, which in this case is displaying distance (Dis) in nautical miles orkilometers (figure 4-46).2.Press  .

Altitude alerting allows you to  select a target altitude and it then provides you with an aural alarm 1000 feet prior to reaching the selected altitude, another aural alarm  upon reaching the selected altitude, and another aural alarm if you deviate from the selected altitude.NOTE:The altitude alerting function of the KLN 89(B) does not meet FAR Part 91 for turbojet-powered civil airplanes.NOTE:Before you use the altitude alerting function, it is a good idea tomake sure that the KLN 89(B) baro setting is current. To do this, press  the button and use the right inner knob to modify the baro setting.To Use Altitude Alerting:1. Select the Setup (SET) 9 page and turn on the cursor (). It willcome on over the  Alert:field.  If OFFis displayed, turn the rightinner knob to select ON(figure4-52).2. Select a warn altitude deviation by positioning the cursor over the Warn: field.  Use the right inner knob to select the desired value (figure 4-53).  It is selectable in one hundred foot increments from  200 feet up to 900 feet or in ten m increments from 60 meters to270 meters.  Normally, you will  use the same value all the time so you only have to enter this the first  time you use altitude alerting.  The  recommended warn altitude devia- tion is 300 feet or 100 meters.Advanced GPS Operation4-14Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-51APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  a Figure 4-52APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   &Figure 4-53KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-15Advanced GPS OperationChapter 43. If necessary, adjust the altitude alert audio volume by moving the cursor to the  Volume:field.  Use the left inner knob to select a desired volume between 00 and 99.  The larger the number, the  louder the volume (figure 4-54).4. Press . The Altitude 1 (ALT 1) page will be displayed with thecursor over the altimeter baro set field.NOTE: The altimeter baro set units may be changed between inch-es, millibars and hectopascals on the SET 8 page (see section 3.3).5. Use the right inner knob to update the altimeter baro setting if required (figure 4-55).6. Press the  button again tomove on to the ALT 2 page (fig- ure 4-56).  Only line 2 of the ALT  2 page is used for altitude alert- ing.  The remainder of the ALT 2  page is used only for vertical nav- igation, or VNAV (see section  4.4).  The first altitude displayed on line 2 is the current indicated altitude (9000 feet in figure 4- 56).  With the proper altimeter baro setting, the indicated altitude  should be the same as the aircraftÕs actual altimeter.NOTE: There may be some difference (less than 100 feet) betweenthe indicated altitude and the aircraftÕs actual altitude if the altitude input to the KLN 89(B) is from an altitude encoder because these encoders only provide altitude in 100 foot increments.7. The cursor should be positioned on the selected (or to) altitude field (figure 4-56).  Enter the  selected altitude using the right inner knob (figure 4-57).8. Press to return to the page which was previously displayed.Notice that when you are on an ordinary (non-altitude) page, the first press of the button brings up the ALT 1 page, the sec-ond press of brings up the ALT 2 page, and the third presstakes you back to the original page.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH \"!;!%L  Figure 4-55APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    ˛&Figure 4-54APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˛## Figure 4-56APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ˛%˛ Figure 4-579. The aural alarm activates as follows: ¥1000 feet prior to reaching the selected altitude--three shorttones¥Upon reaching the selected altitude--two short tones¥Deviating above or below the selected altitude by more thanthe warn altitude--four short tonesNOTE:Due to the resolution of the altitude input, it may be neces-sary to descend slightly below or climb slightly above the selected altitude before the two tones are activated indicating that the selected altitude has been reached.  This selected altitude alert must be  activated to arm the system for providing the altitude deviation alert.The KLN 89(B) can provide the aural alarm tones in either of twoways: it may be connected to an audio input of an audio amplifier contained in an audio panel so that the aural alarm is heard through  the aircraftÕs speaker and headphones. Or the KLN 89(B) may be interfaced with an external tone generator installed in the aircraft.In order to use altitude alerting, the KLN 89(B) must have an altitudeinput. If the altitude input is from an altitude encoder or from an air  data computer not having a baro altitude output, then it will be neces- sary for you to manually input the proper altimeter setting in order to get accurate alerting. Remember, the altitude coming from an encoder is pressure altitude and must be corrected with the proper altimeter setting to convert to actual altitude. This altimeter setting is easily accomplished by entering the altimeter baro setting on the Altitude (ALT) 1 page.  Press  twice more to return to the page previously displayed. ItÕs so easy you have no excuses for not keep-ing the baro setting updated!CAUTION:  The altitude alerting feature will only be accurate if the altimeter baro correction is kept updated.  If altitude alerting  is used, it is a good idea to update the altimeter baro set on the ALT 1 page each time you make a change to the aircraftÕs  altimeter setting.NOTE:The altitude alerting feature can be disabled in the KLN 89(B)at the time of installation so that these features are not selectable by the pilot.  When this has been done, the SET 9 page displays  Feature Disabled.Advanced GPS Operation4-16Advanced GPS OperationChapter 44.4.ADVISORY VNAV OPERATION The KLN 89(B)Õs advisory vertical navigation (VNAV) feature allowsyou to program a descent or ascent path, and then provides you with an advisory altitude to fly that will provide guidance along the vertical path.  For example, you can program the VNAV to provide descent  guidance so that you arrive at your active waypoint or a waypoint in the active flight plan at an altitude that you specify.  The KLN 89(B)  will alert you of when to start the descent, and display the advisory altitudes to fly throughout the descent.4.4.1.VNAV FOR DIRECT TO OPERATION  The Altitude 2 (ALT 2) page is used to program the KLN 89(B) for vertical navigation.  To get to the ALT 2 page from any non-altitude  page, press the button twice.  The following example will be usedto illustrate how to use the VNAV feature.  You are using the KLN  89(B) to fly direct to your destination airport, Dubuque Municipal air- port (KDBQ) located in Dubuque, Iowa.  You are presently about 65  nautical miles west of Dubuque, flying at 7500 feet MSL (figure 4-58).  You  desire to use the VNAV to provide  vertical guidance to DubuqueÕs trafficpattern altitude of 1900 feet MSLTo use VNAV on a Direct To: 1. Select the ALT 2 page by pressing the button twice(figure 4-59).  The aircraft Õs actu-al altitude (7500 feet) is displayed on the left side of line 2.  If the  displayed altitude is incorrect it is probably because you have not recently updated the KLN 89(B)Õs altimeter baro setting on theALT 1 page (see section 3.3).NOTE:There may be some difference (less than 100 feet) betweenthe indicated altitude and the aircraftÕs actual altitude if the altitude input to the KLN 89(B) is from an altitude encoder because these  encoders only provide altitude in 100 foot increments.The identifier for the active waypoint (KDBQ) is automatically dis-played on the ALT 2 page.  Prior to programming a VNAV operation,  the top of the page displays that the VNAV is inactive (Vnv Inactive).KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-17Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-58APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ˛˛˛ Figure 4-59Advanced GPS Operation4-18Advanced GPS OperationChapter 42. The cursor should be on and over the selected altitude field on the right side of line 2.  If the cursor is not on, press .3. Enter the desired altitude of 1900 feet in the selected altitude field, using the right inner knob. The altitude may be entered in 100 foot or 10 meter increments (fig- ure 4-60).NOTE:If the KLN 89(B) does not have an altitude input, the indicat-ed altitude field on the left side of line 2 will be preceded by a colon (:), indicating that you should manually enter the aircraftÕs pre- sent altitude, as well as the desired altitude.4. Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the offset field adja- cent to the active waypoint identifier. Entering an offset allows you to reach the desired altitude a specified distance before or after reaching the way-point. If you wished to reach a certain altitude 5 miles after passing a waypoint, you would enter +05. In this example youdesire to reach traffic pattern altitude two nautical miles prior to the airport, which allows sufficient time to slow down and prepare for the landing. Enter an offset of-02nm (figure 4-61).5. Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the groundspeed  (GS:) field.  Use the right inner knob to select your anticipated groundspeed for the descent (figure 4-62), remembering that it may increase from your current groundspeed when you start descending.Notice that the bottom right corner of the ALT 2 page now displays a verti- cal speed.  If you wish to start your  descent now using the displayed ver- tical speed, use the outer knob to  position the cursor over the vertical speed field (figure 4-63).  VNAV oper-  ation is initiated by bringing the cursor over the vertical speed field. Or, by leaving the cursor off of this field, you may watch the required vertical speed increase as you fly toward your waypoint.

Figure 4-60desired vertical speed is reached, position the cursor over the verticalspeed field and VNAV will commence.  When VNAV begins, the top  of the page displays an advisory altitude.  Descending at the vertical  speed displayed on line 4 should keep you very close to the VNAV advisory altitude, but you may need to make slight adjustments to stay right on pace.A better way yet to initiate VNAV is to program a desired vertical speed to use for the descent, after you have entered the desired alti- tude, waypoint, offset, and groundspeed. To program a vertical  speed, do the following step:6. Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the vertical speed field, and then enter the desired value (figure 4-64). Vertical speed may be selected in incre- ments of 100 feet per minute or10 meters per minute. If the time to begin your descent is greater than one hour, Vnv Armedwill now be displayed on the top lineof the page. If the time is less than one hour, the top line displays a countdown to the time to begin the descent.7. Return to any desired page for now by pressing the  buttononce. Alternatively, you may turn off the and use the outerknob to change pages. Approximately 90 seconds before the time to begin descent, the message prompt will flash.  When you  view the Message page, it will display  Vnv Alert.  This is notification for you to view the ALT 2 or NAV 1 page (see section 4.4.3) because it is getting close to the time to begin yourdescent.8. When the countdown timer reaches 0:00, the time will be  replaced with an advisory altitude (figure 4-65).  Begin your descent  at a rate such that the altitude  displayed on your altimeter matches the advisory altitude.NOTE:During your descent, check your actual groundspeed to veri-fy that it is similar to the one you entered on the ALT 2 page.  If it is  different, you should enter your actual groundspeed so that the VNAV function will work properly.If you make any changes to the ÒfromÓ or  ÒtoÓ altitudes, the VNAV waypoint, or the waypoint offset once VNAV has been armed, or is actually in progress, the VNAV status will change to  ÒInactiveÓ.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-19Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   ˝˛<Figure 4-64APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ˛$! Figure 4-65Additionally, you may force the VNAV into ÒInactiveÓ status by chang- ing the vertical speed to +0000fpm. To reactivate VNAV afterchanging a parameter, simply move the cursor to the vertical speed field, or select the new desired vertical speed.If you make a change to the groundspeed during the time VNAV isactive, VNAV will remain active, and a new vertical speed will be cal- culated and displayed. If you wish to change this vertical speed, go ahead and do so and the VNAV descent or ascent will be modified for the new parameters.CAUTION:  Advisory VNAV operation will only be accurate if the altimeter baro correction is kept updated.  If advisory VNAV is  used, it is a good idea to update the altimeter baro set on the ALT page each time you make a change to the aircraftÕs altime-  ter setting.4.4.2.VNAV FOR FLIGHT PLAN OPERATION  Using the vertical navigation function when flying via a flight plan isvirtually the same as for the previous Direct To example.  The ALT 2  page will initially contain the identifier for the active ÒtoÓ waypoint in the flight plan.  You may program the vertical ascent or descent refer-  encing this waypoint or you may use the right inner knob to cycle through the waypoints in the active flight plan (FPL 0) which are still in front of the aircraftÕs position.  When another valid waypoint in the flight plan is entered on the ALT 2 page, the aircraft Õs lateral flight path is not altered.  This means that you may program a vertical flight  path having an ascent or descent point that begins prior to the flight plan leg containing the selected VNAV waypoint.4.4.3.VNAV FROM THE NAV 1 PAGE  The NAV 1 page can be configured to display the VNAV status.  This means that you will not have to change pages as much to see what altitude you should be at. You will still need to set up the VNAV problem by using the ALT 2 page as described in section 4.4.1.To use the NAV 1 page to view the VNAV status: 1. Set up the VNAV situation on the ALT 2 page.  2. Select the NAV 1 page.  3. Turn on the cursor and use the right outer knob to move the cur- sor to the cyclic field on the bottom line (figure 4-66).Advanced GPS Operation4-20Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-66KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-21Advanced GPS OperationChapter 44. This field displays bearing to active waypoint, radial from  active waypoint, or VNAV status. Press the button until theVNAV status is displayed (figure 4-67).  Turn off the cursor.The NAV 1 page will now display VNAV status until you change thepage configuration to display something else.  If the VNAV problem  has not been defined yet, then Vnv Offwill be displayed.  If the time to start VNAV operation is greater than one hour then Vnv Armedisdisplayed.  When the time to VNAV operation is less than one hour  then the NAV 1 page will display the time until VNAV operation will start.  For example,  Vnv  4:53 would be displayed if the time untilVNAV operation is 4 minutes and 53 seconds.  If the VNAV function  has started and is suggesting an altitude then the NAV 1 page will display this altitude.  For example  Vnv  4300 would be displayed ifthe suggested altitude was 4300 feet.4.5.CALCULATOR PAGES The Calculator (CAL) pages are used for trip planning and calculation of a variety of flight-related information. They are convenient both on the ground before you begin your flight, and in the air.Data entered on any of the Calculator pages has no effect on naviga-tion data provided on any Navigation (NAV) or Flight Plan (FPL)  pages.  You may perform trip calculations without disturbing ongoing  navigation.NOTE:The Calculator pages rely on pilot enterable inputs forgroundspeed, fuel flow, fuel reserve requirements, altitudes,  temperature, airspeed, etc.  These pages do not utilize inputs from  fuel flow or air data sensors.4.5.1.THE CALCULATOR 1 (CAL 1) PAGE The CAL 1 page allows you to do distance, bearing, time, and mini-mum enroute safe altitude (ESA) calculations that you might otherwise need a chart, ruler, and pocket calculator for.  The KLN  89(B) will perform these calculations either from waypoint to waypoint  (for in-flight calculations, your present position can be one of the way- points), or for one of your flight plans (active or stored).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-67Advanced GPS Operation4-22Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4To calculate distance, bearing, time , and ESA from waypoint to waypoint:1.From the CAL 1 page (figure      4- 68), turn on the cursor ().

To use these pages, you need to have a good idea what the typical fuel flow rate for your aircraft is. This information can often be found for given cruise power settings in a \"performance\" section of the PilotÕs OperatingHandbook for the aircraft. The units for fuel are not specified on this  page, but the units of time are always hours.  This means that you can  use gallons per hour, pounds per hour, kilograms per hour, etc. Like with the CAL 1 page, the fuel calculations can be done from waypoint to waypoint (including present position), or for one of your flight plans.To calculate fuel requirements from waypoint to waypoint:1.From the CAL 2 page, turn on the cursor ( ).

If you desire to change it,  enter the current pressure alti-  tude to the nearest hundred feet or ten meters by using the right inner knob (figure 4-87).3.Use the right outer knob to move the cursor to the first  Temp:field, and then use the right inner and outer knobs to enter theoutside air temperature (degrees Celsius) (figure 4-88). The first digit of the temperature is either Ò0Ó if the temperature is above zero or Ò-Ó if the temperature is below zero. For maximum accuracy, the static air tempera- ture should be entered. This is the temperature of air without the effect of heating due to the aircraftÕs movement through the air.For the airspeeds of most piston aircraft, the difference between static air temperature and the observed air temperature (or  Òtotalair temperatureÓ) is negligible.

If the pressure altitude was previously calculated on the  CAL 4 page, or entered on the CAL 5 page, it will already be  displayed.4.Move the cursor to the first  Tempposition, and then enter theoutside air temperature (degrees C) by using the right inner and outer knobs (figure 4-90).  The  first digit of the temperature is  either Ò0Ó if the temperature is above zero or Ò-Ó if the tempera- ture is below zero.  For maximum  accuracy, the total air tempera-  ture should be entered.  This is  the temperature of air including the effect of heating due to the aircraftÕs movement through the air.  The temperature read on a standard outside air temperature gauge found on most piston air- craft is Òtotal air temperatureÓ.  Since the difference between static air temperature and the observed air temperature (or Òtotalair temperatureÓ) is usually negligible, any temperature enteredon the CAL 5 page is transferred to this page.  The true airspeed  (TAS) is now displayed.NOTE: If a compatible air data system is interfaced to the KLN89(B), true airspeed (TAS) is displayed directly on the Other 11 (OTH 11)page for the present conditions.4.5.7.THE CALCULATOR 7 (CAL 7) PAGE The CAL 7 page is used to determine the present wind direction andspeed.

These waypoints will be very helpful to you.  One major application is private  use airstrips, which are not included in the Jeppesen data base. They are also handy for points which you fly over frequently, and  wish to navigate to.  For example, a crop sprayer would want to store  the locations of the fields he or she dusts often.There are three ways to create a user-defined waypoint.  If you happen to know the latitude and longitude of the point, that is one option.  The waypoint can also be defined as a radial and distance  from another waypoint.  A third choice is just to store your present  position under the identifier you have chosen.NOTE:Whenever you are in a waypoint entry situation, such as aDirect To waypoint or flight plan, and you enter an identifier which is not in the data base, the KLN 89(B) will automatically start the user- defined waypoint creation process.Advanced GPS Operation4-30Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 4-96APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-94APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-95To delete a user-defined waypoint that is no longer needed, seesection 3.14.2, \"Viewing and Deleting User Waypoints and Waypoint Remarks\".4.6.1.

This is done by selecting between the two course modes, LEG and OBS. The LEG mode means that the course to the active waypoint is selected by the KLN 89(B), and is the default mode when the KLN 89(B) starts up. The other course mode, OBS, is the mode that allows you to select the course to or from the active  waypoint. In this mode, the KLN 89(B) operates very much like a VOR receiver. This is the mode that you will use quite often if you conduct any non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B.àThe KLN 89B also has three modesthat are associated with approach operations. These are Enroute,  Approach Arm and Approach Active. These modes will be explained in Chapter 5.The course mode is annunciated onthe left side of the screen, line 3. When in the Leg mode, it displays Leg(figure 4-119), and when in theOBS mode, it displays the selected magnetic course (figure 4-120).4.7.1.SELECTING THE LEG MODE OR THE OBS MODE  To change course modes:1.Press the  button.2.If the KLN 89(B) was previously in the Leg mode, it will now be in the OBS mode, and vice versa.4.7.2.THE LEG MODE  The following are the characteristics of the Leg Mode:1.The default course deviation indicator (CDI) sensitivity is plus and minus five nautical miles, full scale.  This applies to the CDI on  the NAV1 page as well as any external CDIs or HSIs interfaced  to the KLN 89(B).  If the CDI or HSI has five dots left and right of  the center position, then each dot represents one nautical mile of deviation.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-35Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-120APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-1192.Navigation is provided along the great circle path between two waypoints.  As you probably know, great circle navigation is the  shortest distance between two points located on the earth\\'s surface.  In the case of Direct To operation, the \"from\" waypoint  is not displayed but it is the point where Direct To operation was initiated.  The course to fly while in this mode is referred to as the  desired track (Dtk).  The desired track is displayed on the NAV 1 and may be selected for display on the NAV 4 page. To fly a great circle course between two points, the desired track may be constantly changing. A good way to illustrate this concept is with a world globe and a piece of string. You can determine the great circle path between Denver, Colorado and Manila, Philippines by stretching the string over the globe between these two points. Notice that you would start the flight with a northwesterly desired track, which gradually becomes due westerly, and finally south- westerly by the time you reach Manila. Of course, your trips with the KLN 89(B) will be substantially shorter and the desired track will probably change only a few degrees.3.Automatic waypoint sequencing is provided during flight plan operation.  As you reach a waypoint in your flight plan, the next  leg of the flight plan automatically becomes active. àThere aresome situations during approach operations in which automatic leg sequencing is automatically disabled. See Chapter 5.4.Turn anticipation may be utilized in flight plan operation as described in section 4.2.2.5.The Minimum Enroute Safe Altitude (ESA) displayed on the ALT 1 page is the highest MSA sector altitude from the present position to the destination waypoint along the active flight plan or Direct To route (whichever is in use). See section 3.12.4.7.3.THE OBS MODE  The following are characteristics of the OBS mode.1.The course deviation indicator (CDI) sensitivity is plus and minus five nautical miles, full scale.  This applies to the CDI on the NAV  1 page as well as any external CDIs or HSIs interfaced to the KLN 89(B). If the CDI or HSI has five dots left and right of the  center position, then each dot represents one nautical mile of deviation.2.The course is defined by the active waypoint and the selected magnetic course. A course \"to\" or \"from\" the active waypoint may be selected.Advanced GPS Operation4-36Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-37Advanced GPS OperationChapter 43.The course selection is normally made by changing the selected course displayed on an external indicator such as an HSI or CDI. When this is done, the pilot must verify that the proper course has been selected by confirming the digital selected course readout displayed on the KLN 89(B).  In the OBS mode the selected  course is always displayed as part of the mode annunciation on line 3 of the left side of the KLN 89(B) screen. In many installa- tions, two or more navigation sources can be displayed on one indicator. In these situations there is a switch in the aircraft panel which will determine what navigation source is displayed. For the KLN 89(B) to properly read the external indicator the KLN 89(B) must be the displayed navigation source on the external indicator.When the KLN 89(B) is not the displayed navigation source onthe external indicator, it is possible to change the selected course from the KLN 89(B) screen using the procedure below.To change the selected course in OBS mode:1.If the KLN 89(B) is not in OBS mode, select OBS mode by  pressing the button. Ifalready in OBS mode, turn on the cursor( ). The cursorwill automatically be turned on over the OBS selected course field (figure 4-121).2.Turn the right inner knob until the correct selected course isdisplayed (figure 4-122).3.Turn off the cursor ( ).NOTE: The above procedures apply to ORS 02 software. For ORS01 software, the cursor does not automatically come on when the OBSmode is selected and must be activated by using the  but-ton. In addition, the OBSselected course field is not the default  cursor location. The right outer knob must be used to position the cur- sor over this field after it has been turned on.4.There is no automatic leg sequencing or turn anticipation. 5.The Minimum Enroute Safe Altitude ( ESA) displayed on the ALT1 page is the highest MSA sector altitude between the present position and the active waypoint. See section 3.12. Other way- points in the active flight plan do not affect the ESA.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  &˛!Figure 4-122APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   &%#Figure 4-121Advanced GPS Operation4-38Advanced GPS OperationChapter 46.When the active waypoint is a VOR, and the AUTO magnetic variation mode is active (see section 4.10), the published mag- netic variation for the VOR is utilized rather than the calculated magnetic variation, so that the KLN 89(B) indication will be identi- cal to a NAV receiver indication.4.7.4. SWITCHING FROM THE LEG MODE TO THE OBS MODE The following mode transition occurs if the KLN 89(B) is in the Legmode and the mode is changed to the OBS mode.:1.The waypoint that was active in Leg mode prior to the mode change remains the active waypoint in OBS mode.2.The selected course is defined by two different methods depend- ing on the installation and the status of the unit.i.If the KLN 89(B) is the displayed navigation source when the change is made to OBS mode, then the selected course  becomes whatever was set on the external indicator prior to changing to the OBS mode.  This value should normally be the  desired track to the active waypoint if you had the external indica- tor set to the correct value prior to switching to the OBS mode.ii.If the KLN 89(B) is not displayed on the external indicator, then the selected course is chosen such that the deviation from the selected course remains the same.3.If the OBS value chosen by default from rule 2 above is unac- ceptable, you can always define the desired course by the methods described in section 4.7.3.4.7.5.EFFECTS OF SWITCHING FROM OBS MODE TO LEG  MODEThe following mode transition occurs if the KLN 89(B) is in the OBSmode with a TO indication and the mode is switched to the Leg  mode:1.The waypoint that was active while in the OBS mode remains the active waypoint when the Leg mode is activated.  The system  does not attempt to orient itself on a leg of the active flight plan unless the TO/FROM indicator is indicating FROM. In the FROM case, the KLN 89(B) will reorient on the active flight plan.2.The selected course ( Obs) that was active in the OBS modeprior to switching to Leg mode becomes the desired track (Dtk) inKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-39Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4the Leg mode, unless the mode change was made on the ÒfromÓside in which case the KLN 89(B) will calculate the correct desired track for the new leg.3.With the exception of #2 above, the characteristics of normal Direct To operation apply.4.If the active waypoint was part of the active flight plan (FPL 0), the system will revert to normal flight plan operation once the active waypoint is reached.4.7.6.GOING DIRECT TO A WAYPOINT WHILE IN THE OBS  MODEThe direct-to function will select the OBS value that will take the air-craft from the present position direct to the active waypoint when the  KLN 89(B) is not the displayed navigation source on the external indi- cator.If the KLN 89(B) is the displayed navigation source on an HSI or CDIit is not possible for the KLN 89(B) to change the OBS value.  In these situ-  ations the KLN 89(B) will provide a scratchpad message that will tell you what OBS value should be selected to go direct to the active waypoint (figure 4-123).4.7.7.ACTIVATING A WAYPOINT WHILE IN THE OBS MODE  While in the OBS mode, you may activate another waypoint by usingthe normal Direct To method or by using a second method.  This sec- ond method activates another waypoint without changing the selected course (OBS).  In other words, when the new waypoint is activated, the D-Bar is not necessarily recentered.  In figure 4-124 the KLN  89(B) is in the OBS mode and the selected course is 149¡.  You have just crossed ARG and desire to  activate the next waypoint in the flight plan, GQE, without recentering the D- Bar.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH ,$%!Figure 4-124APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-123Advanced GPS Operation4-40Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4To activate a waypoint in OBS mode without changing the selected course:1.Press  (figure 4-125).

Press .4.Press  to approve the waypoint page and activate the waypoint(figure 4-127).  The selected course does not change, therefore this  method does not center the D-Bar like a Direct To operation does.4.7.8.CHANGING THE CDI SCALE FACTOR  The CDI scale factor can be changed by using the NAV 1 page.  In nor- mal operations it is possible to select a CDI scale factor which is plus or minus 5 NM, 1 NM or 0.3 NM full scale deflection.  This means that if  the scale factor was ±1 NM and the needle was deflected full scale to  the right, the aircraft would be 1 NM left of course.  The default CDI  scale factor is ±5 NM. To change the CDI scale factor: 1.Select the NAV 1 page. 2.Turn on the cursor ( ).  It will appear over the second line of the NAV 1 page, which usually dis- plays the course deviation indicator (figure 4-128).  This is a cyclic field,  as indicated by the carat (>) pre-ceding it.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH , Figure 4-127APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,aFigure 4-126APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  a Figure 4-128APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  ,aFigure 4-125KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAdvanced GPS Operation 4-41Advanced GPS OperationChapter 43.Press the  button until thisline changes to the CDI scale field (figure 4-129).4.Rotate the right inner knob to select the desired CDI scale factor  (figure 4-130).

The CDI scale factor change is complete.àNOTE:The KLN 89B will automatically select a scale factor while inone of the approach modes.  When the KLN 89B selects a CDI scale  factor it is not possible to select a scale factor that is less sensitive than what the KLN 89B has automatically chosen.  For example, as  you will see in the next chapter, the approach-arm mode usually has a scale factor of ±1 NM.  While in the approach-arm mode it is not  possible for you to select the ±5 NM scale factor.  This is to ensure  proper operation of the approach modes.4.8.THE FUEL MANAGEMENT PAGES Certain models of fuel management computers manufactured by Shadin Company, ARNAV Systems, Inc., and Sheltech Ltd. May be interfaced with the KLN 89(B).  The primary benefit of having the KLN  89(B) interfaced with a Òreal timeÓ fuel management computer is that the system can continuously compute the amount of fuel required to reach the destination and the amount of fuel that will be on board  upon reaching the destination.  The concept is the following.  The fuel  management computer continuously sends the rate of fuel flow and the amount of fuel remaining to the KLN 89(B).  The KLN 89(B) con-  tinuously calculates the aircraftÕs distance, groundspeed, andestimated time enroute (ETE) to the destination waypoint.  The fuel  required to reach the destination waypoint is the ETE multiplied by the current rate of fuel flow.  The amount of fuel that will be remaining  at the destination is the amount of fuel presently remaining minus the fuel required to reach the destination.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 4-129APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-130Advanced GPS Operation4-42Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4CAUTION:  The KLN 89(B) fuel calculations are based on the pre- sent rate of fuel flow, the present groundspeed, the present distance to destination along the programmed route, and the  amount of fuel presently remaining.  Before take-off, the fuel flow  computer must be properly initialized with the amount of fuel on  board (FOB) the aircraft.  For some Shadin fuel computers without  display units, you may enter the initial FOB during the KLN 89(B) Turn-on and Self Test (see section 3.2).  Since many factors influ-  ence the required amount of fuel to reach the destination, it is the pilotÕs responsibility to view the fuel management pages often to check for any significant changes.  Some factors affecting the  amount of fuel required are power changes, altitude changes, head- wind/tailwind component changes, fuel/air mixture adjustments, and routing changes.The OTH 7, OTH 8, OTH 9, and OTH 10 pages are used to display fuelmanagement information for KLN 89(B)s interfaced with compatible fuel management computers. If there is no fuel management computer inter- face, these fuel management pages are not displayed.4.8.1.THE OTHER 7 (OTH 7) PAGE  The OTH 7 pages display the followinginformation (figures 4-131 and 4-132):¥The destination waypoint (thefinal waypoint in FPL 0 or a direct to waypoint if the waypoint is not  included in FPL 0).

When interfaced with one  of these systems, the KLN 89(B) will display real time air data parame- ters such as true airspeed (TAS), static air temperature (SAT), total air temperature (TAT), Mach number, density altitude, and pressure altitude. With a TAS input from an air data computer and a compatible heading input, the KLN 89(B) will calculate and display real time wind data (mag- nitude and direction).APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 4-135APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-136APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-137APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 4-138Advanced GPS Operation4-45Advanced GPS OperationChapter 4NOTE:Heading information inputs to the KLN 89(B) must be in a formatwhich is different than available from most mechanical compass sys-  tems, including the Bendix/King KCS 55A (KI 525A HSI with bootstrap  heading synchro) and KCS 305 compass systems.  However, the com-  patible Shadin air data system will convert three wire analog heading information from these mechanical systems into the proper format.The Other 11 and Other 12 (OTH 11and OTH 12) pages are used todisplay air data information if both a fuel management system and an air data system are interfaced to the KLN 89(B).  If there is no fuel manage-  ment system, air data information is displayed on the Other 7 and Other 8 pages.  If there is no air data system interface, these pages are not dis-  played.NOTE:These air data pages receive inputs from air data sensors anddisplay real time air data information.  They are independent of the CAL  4, CAL 5, CAL 6 and CAL 7 pages which rely on manual pilot inputs to  calculate air data information.4.9.1.THE OTHER 11 (OTH 11) PAGE Without a fuel management system thisbecomes the OTH 7 page.

As with any good friend, you may need some time to get well- acquainted. This will allow you to utilize it to the maximum extent. A great  way to get to know the KLN 89(B) is to use it outside the airplane, using  what we call the \"take-home mode\".There are products available which allow you to use the KLN 89(B) at your home, office, or hotel to have get-acquainted time in the take-home mode, for instance the Commander 2000 from Lone Star Aviation.  It is  also helpful to do flight planning and perform data base updates outside the airplane, perhaps with a home personal computer.For more information on the Commander 2000, or to place an order, con-tact:Lone Star Aviation Corp. 1306 Tatum Drive Arlington, TX 76012 Phone: (817) 548-7768 FAX: (817) 261-8692When the KLN 89(B) is in the take-home mode, it performs as if it isreceiving adequate satellite signals to determine its position.  It displays  the latitude and longitude of its last known position or of whatever posi- tion it is initialized to on the Setup 1 (SET 1) page (see section 3.6, \"Initialization and Time to First Fix\").  In addition, a ground speed and  heading may be entered on the SET 1 page and the KLN 89(B) will track  a flight plan or a direct to waypoint just as if it was actually functioning in  an aircraft.  Distances count down, waypoints sequence, and the devia-  tion bar follows the progress of the simulated flight.  Using the take-home  mode is an excellent way to learn the operation of the KLN 89(B) without worrying about the engine running, other traffic, or even terrain. Fortunately, these phenomena are not simulated in the take-home mode!KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-1Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 55.  APPROACHES AND SID/STARS (KLN 89B  ONLY) This is the last chapter on the operation of the KLN 89(B).  In this chapter you will learn how to use the KLN 89B for non-precision  approach and SID/STAR procedures.  Note that only KLN 89Bs  which are configured for IFR approaches are capable of performing the procedures discussed in this chapter.  KLN 89Bs which are con-  figured for en route and terminal operations only will give you access to SID/STAR procedures but not non-precision procedures. All of these procedures require that you are comfortable with the operation of the unit as presented up to this point.  In particular, you need to be  comfortable with flight plan operation (sections 4.1 and 4.2) and the OBS mode (section 4.7).5.1.  NON-PRECISION APPROACH OPERATIONS Flying non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B are not in them- selves very difficult.  However, it is different than using traditional  equipment such as VORs and NDBs.  With this in mind, make sure  that you practice with the KLN 89B in VFR weather with a check pilot before attempting to use the KLN 89B in actual IFR conditions.CAUTION:  The KLN 89B obtains approach information from the data base. Therefore, it is extremely important that the data base  is current. The KLN 89B is approved for IFR non-precision approaches only when the data base is current.  If you attempt  to select an approach when the data base is out of date, you will  be given the status-line message: ÒD Base ExpireÓ in the bottom  left portion of the screen as a reminder.The following sections assume that your KLN 89B is properlyinstalled in the aircraft with all of the necessary accessories to fly non-precision approaches.  In most cases this will mean that the air-  craft has external switch/annunciators to arm the approach mode.  An external annunciator to indicate when a message is active and when waypoint sequencing is about to occur will also be installed.  In some  installations the aircraft will have a NAV/GPS switch to select which navigation source is displayed on the primary HSI or CDI.The NAV 4 page has been specifically designed to provide most ofthe functions needed for non-precision approaches.  This page pro-  vides an interface that presents pertinent navigation information, a way to access the flight plan, and a graphic presentation of the pre- sent position relative to the flight plan waypoints.  You will find this  page to be a good friend while performing GPS based non-precision approaches.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-2Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5NOTE: There are some approach procedures in the world that arenot suited for the operational characteristics of the KLN 89B.  These  procedures are not included in the data base.  Therefore it is not  possible to use the KLN 89B for these approaches.  It is good pre-  flight practice ensure that the KLN 89B contains anticipated  procedures for the flight.In addition to the two course modes (Leg and OBS) described in sec-tion 4.7, there are also two approach modes.  These are approach  arm and approach active.  The status of the approach mode is indi-  cated on an external switch/annunciator. In most installations the external annunciator will indicate ARMfor the approach arm modeand approach active will be annunciated by ACTV.  The main differ- ence of these modes from the normal en route mode is that the integrity monitoring is set to a tighter level. Another difference between these modes and the en route mode is that the CDI scale factor will usually change to ±1.0 NM for ARM and will always change  to ±0.3 NM when in the APR ACTV mode. The ARM mode can be selected in two ways.  The normal way is that this mode will be selected automatically by the KLN 89B when the aircraft is within 30 NM of an airport and an approach is loaded in the  flight plan for that airport.  It is possible to arm the approach mode at  a distance greater than 30 NM from the airport by pressing the exter-  nal GPS approach switch, but the KLN 89B will not change the CDI scale factor until the aircraft reaches the 30 NM point.  If the GPS  APR external switch is pressed while the approach mode is armed, then the KLN 89B will disarm the approach and change back to en route mode.  The CDI scale factor will also change back to ±5.0 NM.  The approach can be re-armed by simply pressing the GPS APR switch again.  The APR ACTV mode can only be engaged automatically by the KLN89B. To cancel the APR ACTV mode press the external GPS APR switch.  This will change the mode to APR ARM.  Once past the FAF, it is not possible to return to the approach active mode without con-ducting a missed approach and flying back to the FAF.General Procedure for Non-Precision Approaches Non-precision approaches will all have the general flow of events asfollows.  Refer to figure 5-1.1.Select and load the approach into the flight plan.This can bedone at almost any time but must be completed before reaching the Final Approach Fix and should be done as soon as possible.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-3Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5This corresponds to point A in figure 5-1.  If the aircraft is greater than 30 NM from the airport, then the CDI scale factor will remain  at the default ±5 NM full scale deflection. 2.Transition to the approach arm mode. This will occur auto-matically when the aircraft is within 30 NM of the airport and there is an approach loaded into the flight plan (position B in fig- ure 5-1).  The CDI scale factor will change to ±1.0 NM over the  next 30 seconds and the external annunciator will indicate ARM.3.Get established on the final approach course.¥  NoPT arrival route¥  Radar vectors  (requires OBS mode)¥  Procedure turn or holding pattern (requires OBS mode)¥  DME arc17351432MAPFAF IAFARPApproach Arm CDI Scale Factor  1.0 nmCDI Scale Factor  5.0 nmCDI Scale Factor constant at 0.3 nmCDI Scale Factor changing from 1.0 nm to  0.3 nm7030 nm2 nmTransition to approach ACTV if: - LEG mode is selected  - Integrity checks OK  - Aircraft heading towards the FAF -FAF or co-located IAF/FAF is active  waypoint Load approach  into flight planApproach automatically arms when within 30 nm of the airport and an  approach is loaded into  the active flight planFAF-Final Approach Fix  MAP-Missed Approach Point  ARP-Airport Reference Point  IAF-Initial Approach Fix  MAHP-Missed Approach Holding Point NOTTOSCALENOTFORNAVIGATION(A)(B)(C)(D)(E)MAHP(F)Automatic Waypoint sequencing stopsFigure 5-14.Transition to the approach active mode. This mode change isautomatic and occurs at position C in  figure 5-1 when:¥the aircraft is 2 NM from the FAF and the approach mode is armed¥  the LEG mode is selected¥  the aircraft is heading towards the FAF¥  the FAF or a co-located IAF/FAF is the active waypoint¥the KLN 89B confirms that adequate integrity monitoring is available to complete the approach.¥  RAIM is available at FAF & MAPIf any of these conditions are not met, the KLN 89B will not transitionto the approach active mode and a missed approach will be required if the conditions do not change before reaching the FAF.  If all of  these conditions are met then the CDI scale factor will start to change to ±0.3 NM and the external annunciator will indicate  ACTV.5.At the FAF (position D in figure 5-1) the CDI scale factor will be at ±0.3 NM and will remain at this scale factor until you manually  cancel the approach mode by either pressing the external GPS APR button to change to the ARMmode, by initiating a direct tooperation or by changing to OBS mode.WARNING:  It is not approved to conduct the final portion of the approach unless the KLN 89B is in the approach active mode (ACTV on external annunciator).6.Fly to the Missed Approach Point. (position E in figure 5-1).  The KLN 89B will notautomatically sequence to the next waypoint.You must manually change to the appropriate waypoint accord- ing to the situation.  By default, the KLN 89B will nominate the  first waypoint of the published missed approach procedure when is pressed, and the active waypoint is the MAP, and you have flown past the MAP (rule number 4 in section 3.9).7.If necessary conduct the missed approach procedure. Remember to always refer to the paper chart when conducting a missed approach.  The OBS mode is usually needed at some  point during a missed approach and is always required to fly the holding pattern (position F in figure 5-1).The details of the above operations as well as several examples ofhow to conduct non-precision approaches using the KLN 89B are given in the following sections.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-4Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 55.1.1.  SELECTING AN APPROACHThe first item in the list from the previous section is to select and load the approach into the active flight plan.  Approaches are selected  from the APT 8 (or ACT 8) page of the airport for which you desire to  shoot the approach.  If you are operating from a flight plan, the easi-  est way to get to the approach information is by turning to the ACT page for your destination as described in section 4.2.3.The following example will use the VOR or GPS RWY 25R approachto Los Angeles International airport (KLAX).To select and load an approachinto the active flight plan (FPL 0):1.Turn to one of the APT pages and select KLAX by using the  cursor, inner, and outer knobs (figure 5-2)2.Use the right inner knob to turn to the APT 8 page.  If you select- ed KLAX from the APT 1 page turn the inner knob one click counter-clockwise to reach the APT 8 page.3.Turn the cursor on by pressing  .  The cursor comes up on the first approach in the list of approaches.  Use the right outer knob  to move the cursor to different approaches (figure 5-3).  If there are more than 3 approaches to an airport you can move the cur- sor down to ÒscrollÓ the other procedures into view by rotating the right outer knob.4.With the flashing cursor over VOR 25Rpress .  5.The KLN 89B will present a list of Initial Approach Fixes (IAFs) corresponding to this approach. In this example we want the  ELMOO IAF.  Select this by  pressing when the cursor isover ELMOO(figure 5-4).  Note: If there is only one IAF for a procedure, then the KLN 89B willskip this step and go on to the next step.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-5Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-2APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 5-3APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 5-4Approaches and SID/STARs 5-6Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5In many cases ATC will not tell you explicitly which IAF to use. Inthese cases you need to select an IAF which is closest to the route of flight that you expect. If you expect radar vectors, then the selection of the correct IAF is less important because you will be given vectors to the FAF and will not need to use the IAF.6.The KLN 89B next presents a list of waypoints that make up the approach. Review these waypoints to make sure that you have selected the correct IAF.  If  there are more than four waypoints in the approach you can move the cursor up to ÒscrollÓthe other waypoints into view by rotating the right outer knob (figure 5-5).  7.Move the cursor over  ADD TOFPL 0?(figure 5-6) and press.8.The KLN 89B will then bring up the FPL 0 page and put the  sequence of approach waypoints in front of the airport reference point (figure 5-7).NOTE:At any time during the process of selecting an approach youcan easily return to the previous step by pressing the button.The waypoints that make up the approach procedure are loaded intothe flight plan.  At the top of the list of approach waypoints is a  Òhead-erÓ that describes the approach that follows. An example of this is shown on line 1 of figure 5-7, which indicates that the VOR 25R approach for Los Angeles International Airport is in the active flight  plan (FPL 0).After the approach has been entered into the flight plan the KLN 89Bchecks to make sure that the resulting flight plan Òmakes senseÓ.  If the KLN 89B detects any waypoints that are in both the en route por- tion of the flight plan and the portion that makes up the approach,  then the following message will be given:*Redundant Wpts in FPLEdit En Route Wpts As NecessaryAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-7APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  $ Figure 5-5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-6KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-7Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Examine the flight plan and delete those en route waypoints that arenot necessary.NOTE:Approaches can only be entered into FPL 0, the active flightplan. If the KLN 89B is turned off for more than 5 minutes, then the  approach is deleted when power is turned back on.5.1.2.  INTERPRETING WHAT YOU SEEIn the example above, you may have noticed a couple of waypointswith somewhat strange names.  The second waypoint of the  approach procedure, LAX18, has a name that is not normal for a waypoint.  This is an example of what are called  ÒterminalÓ waypoints. These are waypoints that are associated with a specific airport.  They  are used to define a spot on the ground that does not have a normal waypoint name.  In the case of  ÒLAX18Ó this point is 18 NM from the LAX VOR on the 68¡radial.  The fifth waypoint in the approach pro- cedure, MA25B, is another type of terminal waypoint.  In this case  this point is the missed approach point for runway 25.  This approach  applies to both the left and right runways so the letter B is used to mean ÒbothÓ.There are few other types of terminal waypoints that you will need tobe familiar with to fully understand GPS non-precision approaches.  The naming convention for these waypoints are as follows:Fxyyy¥  F stands for Final Approach FixIxyyy¥  I stands for Intermediate FixCxyyy¥  C stands for Course FixMxyyy¥  M stands for Missed Approach PointRWzzz¥  RW stands for Runway Fix.  This is usually the MAP for the approach¥  zzz will be a runway number possibly  including L for Left, R for Right, C for Center, or B for Both.Daaab¥  D stands for DME arc waypoint¥  aaa is the radial that the fix is on from the reference VOR¥  b will be a letter corresponding to the distance from the reference VOR.  For example, G is the seventh letter of the alphabet so D234G would be  a point on the 234¡radial 7 NM from the reference VOR. DME arcs greater than 26 NM will have waypoints where the first two characters are the  first two letters of the DME identifier. The next  three characters will be the radial that the arc way point is on.In the rules above x and yyy are defined as follows.  For runways withonly one approach, x will be replaced with an ÒAÓ or a  ÒFÓ.  For run- ways that have multiple approaches, x will be replaced with ÒVÓ for VOR, ÒNÓ for NDB, or  ÒRÓ for RNAV.  The letters yyy will be replaced with either the runway identifier (e.g., FF25L) or, for circling approaches, the inbound course to the missed approach point (e.g., MA259).Waypoints along a given radial will be named such that the first threeletters are the reference VOR/DME and the next two are the DME  distance. If the distance is greater than 100 NM the order is reversed.  For example, LAX18 is 18 NM from LAX while 26FLW is 126 NM from FLW.If the aircraft is not too far from the destination airport, the NAV 4page can be used to determine where some of these waypoints are relative to others in the approach.  At the time of this writing, all of the  NOS charts and some Jeppesen charts do not show the special ter- minal waypoints that are required for GPS approaches. For this reason it is a good idea to understand what the special waypoints are used for and what they mean.You may have also noticed that some waypoints have a small letterat the end of the waypoint name. The small letter is an aid that we have added to the name of some waypoints to help you recognize important points in the approach. These suffixes are displayed on many of the KLN 89B  pages.  The definitions of these suffixes are:i - The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) of the approach. f - The Final Approach Fix (FAF) of the approach m - The Missed Approach Point (MAP) of the approach h - The Missed Approach Holding Point (MAHP) for the approachEvery approach will have a FAF and a MAP.  Almost all will have an IAF and missed approach holding point.  Another item that you should notice inthe flight plan is the line that has *NOWPT SEQon it (figure 5-8).  This is what is referred to as a fence and the purpose of this line is to tell you thatApproaches and SID/STARs 5-8Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-8KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-9Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5the KLN 89B will not automatically sequence past the waypoint thatprecedes the fence.  The waypoint before the fence is always the  missed approach point. The reason that waypoint sequencing is not allowed is that many missed approach procedures require specific actions before going to the missed approach holding point (e.g., climbing on a fixed heading until reaching an altitude).5.1.3.  CHANGING OR DELETING AN APPROACH ONCELOADED INTO THE FLIGHT PLANThe sequence of waypoints that are retrieved from the data base of the KLN 89B define the approach procedures as they are charted. To ensure that the proper path over the ground is followed, it is not possible to either delete or add waypoints to the approach section of the flight plan.  To help you see which waypoints are en route  waypoints and which are approach waypoints, the KLN 89B does not display a colon next to the waypoint number on the FPL 0 page if the waypoint is an approach waypoint.  It is only possible to replace the existing approach with another one,or delete the entire approach from the flight plan.To replace an existing approach, or delete an approach: 1.With the left page displaying the active flight plan (FPL 0) turn the cursor on by pressing (figure 5-9).  2.Move the cursor so that it covers the approach header at the top ofthe approach procedure.  Once the cursor comes over the  approach header, it will automatically change to read CHANGEAPPR?(figure 5-10). If you pressin this condition the KLN 89Bwill bring up the APT 8 page that corresponds to the current  approach.  At this point it is possi-  ble to select different approach procedures, different IAFs, or both.3.If you press the  button whilethe cursor is over the approach header it will change to read DELETE APPR?(figure 5-12).  If you press now, the KLN 89BAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-9APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-10APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-11Approaches and SID/STARs 5-10Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5will remove the entire approach procedure from the active flight plan.  If the KLN 89B was in the approach arm or the approach  active mode, then deleting the approach will cause the KLN 89B to change back to en route mode.  This means that the CDI scale  factor will change back to the default ±5.0 NM scale. 5.1.4.  EXAMPLE APPROACH:  NO PROCEDURE TURN Now that you know the basics of inserting an approach into the flightplan, we can now show the approach operation of the unit by several examples.  This first example will use the approach that was loaded  into the flight plan in section 5.1.1.  This example will show how the  KLN 89B sequences through an approach and what type of annunci- ations and scale factor changes can be expected.  The KLN 89B will  remain in the familiar Leg mode so there will be no need to change between Leg and OBS mode in this example.  Refer to the approach  plate for this approach (figure 5-12) to see what the procedure looks like.For this example it is assumed that you are on an active flight planwith the final destination being the Los Angeles International airport, KLAX.  It is also assumed that ATC will not give you radar vectors  during this approach.1.Load the VOR 25R approach to KLAX as demonstrated in sec- tion 5.1.1.2.When you are within 30 NM of the airport, the KLN 89B will auto- matically arm the approach mode and provide the following  message:*Press ALT To Set BaroThe message acts as a reminder to make sure the KLN 89B is usingthe correct barometric pressure. If the barometric information is not correct, then the integrity monitoring provided by the KLN 89B will not be as good as it could be. Press to bring up the ALT 1 page andverify that the barometric pressure is correct.NOTE: If the KLN 89B is interfaced with a compatible air data com-puter that provides the correct barometric pressure to the KLN 89B,  then the previous message is not displayed and it is not necessary to update the barometric pressure.At this time the KLN 89B will smoothly change the CDI scale factor to±1.0 NM.  The external approach annunciator installed in the aircraft  will indicate that the approach is in the ARM mode.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-11Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 53.As you approach ELMOO, the KLN 89B will provide waypoint alerting on the external annunciator as well as on the screen of the KLN 89B.  Once you pass ELMOO, the KLN 89B will auto-  matically sequence to the next waypoint in the approach, LAX18.Figure 5-12Approaches and SID/STARs 5-12Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 54.This may be a good time to select the NAV 4 page. This page is especially useful for getting a feeling of where you are in the approach (figure 5-13).5.As the aircraft approaches the LAX18 waypoint, the KLN 89B will again provide waypoint alerting.  As the aircraft passes LAX18  and sequences to FITON, the KLN 89B will provide a message telling you to set the external indicator (CDI or HSI) to a new value. If desired track (DTK) is shown on the screen, this value will flash when the external selected course does not match the DTK within 10¡.6.As the aircraft approaches the FAF (FREBY) it is a good idea to check over the status of the KLN 89B. Look at the KLN 89B screen to verify that LEG sequencing is selected.  Remember,  the KLN 89B will not transition to the approach active mode if the OBS mode is selected. If the KLN 89B shares an HSI or CDI with other NAV sources, it is also good to verify that the NAV/GPS switch is set to GPS.7.By the time the aircraft is 2 NM from FREBY (figure 5-14), the Final Approach Fix, the KLN 89B will make a prediction to see if integrity will be available at the FAF and at the MAP.  If the pre-  diction indicates that integrity monitoring will be available, and RAIM is currently available, the KLN 89B will change the GPS APR annunciator to read ACTV. At this time the KLN 89B will also start to change the CDI scale factor.  By the time the aircraft reaches the FAF (FREBY) the CDI scale factor will be down to ±0.3 NM. 8.The fix NOELE is not included in the list of waypoints provided in the data base. You will need to identify this point by using the along track distances given in the profile view of the approach plate.  In this example NOELE is located 1.3 NM from the MAP.  When the distance to MA25B is 1.3 NM, then the aircraft is at NOELE and you can descend to the MDA for this approach.NOTE:Some approach procedures require that you add up severalalong-track distances to be able to identify a step down fix.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-14APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-13KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-13Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 59.The KLN 89B will again provide waypoint alerting as you approach MA25B. This is shown on the NAV 4 page by a flashing active waypoint identifier (figure 5-15).The following steps would need to be performed if a missed approach is required.11.Upon reaching MA25B and not seeing the runway you decide to perform a missed approach. Remember, the KLN 89B will not automatically sequence past the missed approach point. This is shown on the NAV 4 page by not showing any lines connecting waypoints that are past the MAP. To perform the published  missed approach procedure, press to bring up the direct-to page.  The default waypoint will be the first waypoint of the  missed approach procedure. In this case the first waypoint is LAX. Confirm this waypoint as the direct to waypoint and press .12.Upon reaching LAX, the KLN 89B will sequence to the next way- point in the missed approach procedure, INISH.  In this example,  there is no holding pattern published for the missed approach so you can expect further instructions upon reaching INISH.NOTE:If ATC gives you instructions for a missed approach that isdifferent from the published missed approach procedure, it is always possible for you to select a different direct to waypoint than the default direct to waypoint.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   \\'Figure 5-155.1.5.

An example of this is the VOR RWY 22 approach to Clovis New Mexico Municipal airport, KCVN. To fly this procedure as published use the following steps and refer to figure 5- 16 for the procedure. For this example assume that the aircraft isApproaches and SID/STARs 5-14Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Figure 5-16approaching from the Northeast going Direct-to the Clovis airport with no active flight plan.1.Load the approach into the flight plan as described in section 5.1.1.  In this case there is only one IAF so the KLN 89B does not present the option for you to select an IAF.  In this example, there is no active flight plan to begin with so the KLN 89B will ask to add the approach to FPL 0.2.Approaching the area ATC tells you to go direct-to the TXO VOR and clears you for the approach to KCVN.  This is easy to do  from the NAV 4 page by pulling out on the right inner knob and scanning through the active flight plan by turning the inner knob. Once TXO is displayed in the scanning window (figure 5-17), press and then to initiatea direct to operation to the TXO VOR.3.At a distance of 4 NM to the TXO VOR, the KLN 89B will give the following message:*If Required Select OBSThis message provides a reminder that to fly a course reversal theOBS mode needs to be selected.  Note from the approach chart that  there is a NoPT Arrival Sector for this approach.  If you are approach-  ing TXO within the indicated area there is no need to perform a course reversal and you need to ignore this message. The NoPT sector is not stored in the data base so it is not possible for the KLN 89B to know if a course reversal is required or not; as a result, the KLN 89B will always give this message whenever a waypoint could be used for a course reversal.  The KLN 89B will properly sequence  to the FAF to MAP leg and transition to the approach mode when 2 NM from the IAF/FAF.If, however, you are approaching from any other direction a course reversal is required and the OBS mode will need to be selected.  If  the OBS mode is not selected before reaching TXO, then the KLN 89B will automatically sequence to the missed approach point.  This  is not desirable when performing a course reversal so the OBS mode must be selected before reaching TXO.NOTE: The KLN 89B will only remind you to select OBS mode if theIAF is the active waypoint. Therefore if a course reversal is required, make sure the IAF is the selected waypoint.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-15Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-17Approaches and SID/STARs 5-16Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 54.If a course reversal is required, then upon reaching TXO perform the appropriate holding pattern entry and set the inbound course on the external CDI or HSI.  In this example the inbound course  is 241¡.  At this point the KLN 89B works very similar to a con- ventional VOR/DME.5.Once established on the inbound course of 241 ¡, switch back tothe Leg mode. When Leg mode is selected the FAF is automati- cally made the active waypoint when the IAF and the FAF are at the same waypoint.NOTE:It is mandatory that the unit be in LEG mode with the FAF asthe active waypoint before crossing the FAF to activate the approach active mode and change to ±0.3 NM scale factor. The CDI scale fac-  tor changes from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3 NM over the two miles to the FAF.  Delaying the switch from OBS to Leg mode compresses the scale factor change. This will make the transition more abrupt.  If the switch  from OBS to Leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the KLN 89B to change to the approach active mode.6.When the aircraft is 2 NM from the FAF, the KLN 89B will verify that the proper integrity is available.  If integrity monitoring is  available for the approach, then the KLN 89B will change to the Approach Active mode.  This will be annunciated on the external  approach status annunciator as well as on the KLN 89B.  The  CDI scale factor will also start to change from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3  NM.7.Upon reaching TXO, the KLN 89B will automatically sequence to RW22, the missed approach point.8.The fix at 8 DME from TXO along the final approach course is not included in the waypoints that come from the data base. Since the distance that the KLN 89B is giving you is distance TOthe MAP, you will need to mentally figure out when the aircrafthas reached this point.This is done by looking at the along trackdistances given in the plan view of the approach.  In this case the  fix is 4.1 NM from RW22.  Upon reaching this distance you can  descend to the MDA for this approach.If a missed approach is required for this approach, then the followingsteps would be required.9.The published missed approach procedure for this approach is to make a climbing left turn to 5700 feet and proceed direct to the TXO VOR.  In this case TXO will be the default direct to waypoint KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-17Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5when is pressed.  This is the desired waypoint so press  to confirm the waypoint and proceed direct to the VOR.NOTE: If ATC gives you instructions for a missed approach that aredifferent from the published missed approach procedure, it is always possible for you to select a different direct to waypoint than the default direct to waypoint.10.As the aircraft approaches TXO you will need to select OBS mode to stop waypoint sequencing and define the inbound course for the holding pattern.  If you do not select the OBS  mode before the aircraft is within 4 NM of the holding point, then the KLN 89B presents a message reminding you to select the OBS mode. NOTE:If another attempt at the approach is desired after holding, itis necessary to manually change the active waypoint. When the FAF and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the KLN 89B will automatically change the active waypoint to the FAF when you change from OBS to LEG. Make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active mode.5.1.6.  EXAMPLE APPROACH:  RADAR VECTORSFor this example we will use the same approach that was used in theprevious section except this approach will be conducted with the help of radar vectors from approach control.  The aircraft will be assumed  to be arriving from the West, although this does not change the way the approach will be flown using the KLN 89B.1.The approach has been selected and entered into the flight plan and the aircraft is going direct to KCVN (Clovis, New Mexico Municipal)  as described in section 5.1.5.2.As soon as ATC mentions radar vectors you should immediately start to think of the OBS mode.  Once given radar vectors,  change the active waypoint to TXO and select the OBS mode.  Note that it is not important what order these events take place. It is just as effective to change to OBS mode and then change the active waypoint as it is to change the active waypoint and then switch to OBS mode.3.Next, change the selected course on the CDI or HSI to the final approach course.  For this exam-  ple, the inbound course is 241 ¡.It is now possible to watch your progress on the NAV 4 page and anticipate when you will be given new headings to fly (figure 5-18).4.Once established on the inbound course, you will need to change back to the Leg mode to allow for proper approach operation and automatic leg sequencing.  For best performance, the change  back to Leg mode should be made before the aircraft is 2 NM from the FAF.NOTE: It is mandatory that the unit be in LEG mode with the FAF asthe active waypoint before crossing the FAF to activate the approach active mode and change to ±0.3 NM scale factor.  The CDI scale fac-  tor changes from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3 NM over the two miles to the FAF.  Delaying the switch from OBS to Leg mode compresses the scale factor change. This will make the transition more abrupt.  If the switch  from OBS to Leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the KLN 89B to change to the approach active mode.5.The rest of this approach would be flown using the same steps as presented in section 5.1.5.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-18Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-18KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-19Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 55.1.7.  EXAMPLE APPROACH: ON-AIRPORT NAVAIDAnother common type of approach is an approach that is based onan on-airport navaid. These could be either VOR or NDB approach- es. An example of this type of approach is the VOR RWY 24  approach to Bowman airport in Louisville, Kentucky (Figure 5-19).  The airport identifier for this airport is KLOU.Figure 5-19Approaches and SID/STARs 5-20Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5For this example assume that the aircraft is approaching KLOU fromthe Nabb VOR.1.After passing the Nabb VOR, you are told to expect the VOR 24 approach at KLOU.  You load the approach using the procedure  described in section 5.1.1.2.When the distance from the present position to the destination airport reaches 30 NM, the KLN 89B will automatically arm the  approach mode. The CDI scale factor will transition to ±1.0 NM  and the KLN 89B will provide more sensitive integrity monitoring. You also press to update the barometric information.3.When the aircraft is 4 NM from the BQM VOR, the KLN 89B will give a message reminding you to select the OBS mode.  The  OBS mode is required for the procedure turn.  After passing  BQM, select the outbound course of 068¡on the external CDI or HSI.  4.The aircraft is now headed outbound for the procedure turn.  As soon a practical, you will need to change the active waypoint to FF24, the final approach fix.  This is done by pulling out on the  right inner knob and scanning until FF24f is displayed in the win- dow (figure 5-20) then pressing , then pressing . The OBScourse will still be what is select- ed on the external CDI or HSI (68¡).5.With the OBS mode selected and FF24 as the active waypoint, it is possible to fly the procedure turn.  Allow enough distance past  FF24 to complete the procedure turn and still be 2 NM away before reaching the FAF.  After completing the outbound portion  of the procedure turn, change the selected course to the inbound course of 248¡on the external CDI or HSI.6.Once established on the inbound course the Leg mode will again need to be selected so that proper approach operation and way- point sequencing will occur.NOTE:It is mandatory that the unit be in LEG mode with the FAF asthe active waypoint before crossing the FAF to activate the approach active mode and change to ±0.3 NM scale factor.  The CDI scale fac-  tor changes from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3 NM over the two miles to the FAF.  Delaying the switch from OBS to Leg mode compresses the scaleAPT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   --\"%6Figure 5-20KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-21Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5factor change. This makes the transition more abrupt.  If the switch from OBS to Leg is delayed too long it will not be possible for the KLN 89B to change to the approach active mode.7.When the aircraft is 2 NM from the FAF, the KLN 89B will verify that the proper GPS integrity is available.  If integrity monitoring is available for the approach, then the KLN 89B will change to the Approach Active mode.  This will be annunciated on the external  approach status annunciator as well as on the KLN 89B.  The  CDI scale factor will also start to change from ±1.0 NM to ±0.3  NM.8.Normal waypoint alerting will occur as the aircraft passes the final approach fix. The leg from the final approach fix to the missed approach point will become active and the CDI scale factor will remain at ±0.3 NM.  If the AUTO scale factor was selected on the  NAV 4 page, then the scale factor will zoom in on the airport as the aircraft gets closer and closer to the missed approach point. Eventually the map scale changes to 1 NM.The following steps are followed if a missed approach is required. 9.The missed approach instructions call for a climbing left turn to a heading of 110¡until intercepting the 061¡inbound course to themissed approach holding fix, SCUMY.  To fly this with the KLN  89B it will be necessary to put the KLN 89B into the OBS mode and make SCUMY the active waypoint. Change the selected course on the external CDI or HSI to 061¡.10.Once the aircraft reaches SCUMY, you will need to perform a holding pattern entry suitable for this holding pattern and set the selected course to 241¡for the holding pattern.5.1.8.  EXAMPLE APPROACH:  DME ARCDME arc procedures with the KLN 89B are completely different fromusing traditional VOR and DME equipment. DonÕt worry thoughbecause DME arc procedures using the KLN 89B are also easier than using traditional equipment. This is because the KLN 89B pro- vides left/right guidance around the arc. No more having to watch  distance in one place and radial in another!When being vectored, a DME arc is really a whole bunch of initialapproach fixes placed one next to each other to form an arc. Very  rarely do you actually fly to the beginning of an arc, especially in a radar environment. Instead, the flight path of the aircraft generally  intersects the arc at some point. Once the aircraft is near the arc, it is then possible to turn so that the arc distance is maintained until time to turn to the inbound fix.The following example will show how DME arc procedures are flownusing the KLN 89B. This example approach will be to use the VOR RWY 12 approach to Owatonna, Minnesota, KOWA. The approach plate for this approach is in figure 5-22. Assume that the aircraft is approaching from the North and is in a radar environment.1.ATC assigns the VOR RWY 12 approach. Turn to the APT 8  page for KOWA to select the approach. You select the VOR 12 approach and the KLN 89B pre- sents the IAF selection page (figure 5-21).2.There are five choices for the IAF. Three of these choices you can recognize but the other two, D040L and D220L, are unfamil- iar and not shown on this chart. These two waypoints are the data base identifiers for the ends of the arc. D040L means DME arc point, 040 is the radial on which the waypoint lies, and L indi- cates the distance of the arc. L is the twelfth letter of the alphabet so the L indicates that this is a 12 DME arc. In a similar manner D220L can also be decoded. In this example the aircraft is approaching from the north so the D040L IAF will be selected.3.The KLN 89B knows that this point is associated with a DME arc. Once an arc waypoint is chosen, the KLN 89B determines what radial of the reference VOR the aircraft is presently located on. A waypoint is created that is located at the intersection of the pre- sent radial and the DME arc. This waypoint is the first waypoint in the list of waypoints presented on the APT 8 page before loadingApproaches and SID/STARs 5-22Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH  Figure 5-21the approach into the flight plan(figure 5-23). This waypoint is named using the same conven- tion discussed  earlier.NOTE:If the present radial from the reference VOR is outside of the defined arc, then the KLN 89B will default to the beginning of the arc.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-23Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Figure 5-22APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-23CAUTION:  The KLN 89B does not take into account the geome- try of the active flight plan when determining the arc intercept point.  This point is defined solely on the present radial and the  defined arc distance from the reference VOR.  For this reason it  is better to delay selecting approaches that contain DME arcs until the aircraft is closer to the destination.4.With the cursor over  ADD TO FPL 0? , Press .  The approach will be loaded into the active flight plan just like any other  approach would be.5.After the approach is loaded into the flight plan the KLN 89B may give the message:*Redundant Wpts In FPLEdit En Route Wpts As NecessaryThis message is given because very often it will be necessary toedit the active flight plan to ensure that proper waypoint sequenc- ing occurs.  Examine the flight plan and, if practical, observe the  NAV 4 page to make sure that the sequence of waypoints does not have any unnecessary legs in it.6.The KLN 89B will now provide guidance to the arc intercept point. The NAV 4 page displays the entire arc on the screen. The por- tion that is between the beginning of the arc and the arc intercept is drawn with a dashed line. The part that is between the arc inter- cept point and the end of the arc is drawn with the normal solid line (figure 5-24).7.In some cases ATC may provide radar vectors to the arc.  The KLN 89B provides a means to define a new intercept point based on the current track of the aircraft over the ground.  This can be  done from either the NAV 4 page or from the FPL 0 page. The  dashed line displayed on the NAV 4 page will help you to deter- mine if ATC is giving you correct vectors.¥From the NAV 4 page, pull out the right inner knob to bring up the waypoint scanning window. ¥Turn the right inner knob until the first waypoint of the arc is displayed, D011L in this example.  For approaches this will  have a small (i) appended to the waypoint name. If the  recalculation is to be done from the FPL 0 page, then turn on  the cursor and move it over the first waypoint of the arc.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-24Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-24¥From either page press . This will change the waypoint to read MOVE?(figure 5-25).  If it is desired to recompute  the arc intercept point then  press .  If a new arc  intercept point is not desired  then press again.¥If was pressed, then theKLN 89B will calculate an arc intercept point based on the present track of the aircraft over the ground.  NOTE:If the present track does not intercept the arc, then theKLN 89B will display  No Intcptin the scratchpad area of the screen.8.When the aircraft approaches the arc the KLN 89B will provide waypoint alerting and turn anticipation to join the arc.9.Once established on the arc the KLN 89B provides left/right guid- ance relative to the curved arc. Distance to the active waypoint is the distance from the present position to the active waypoint, NOT the distance along the arc. Refer to Appendix A for the geometry of the arc.10.During the arc, the desired track will be constantly changing.  To help you keep the orientation correct the NAV 4 page will auto- matically display DTK on the fourth line.  It is not possible to  change this to something else while on the arc.  The value dis-  played for the desired track will flash when the difference between the CDI or HSI and the current desired track is greater than 10¡.11.Some DME arcs have defined radials that serve as step down fixes. These points are not stored in the data base. To help you determine your position relative to these step-down points along the arc, the KLN 89B will display a new value in the bottom right corner of the display on the NAV 4 page. This new bit of informa- tion is denoted by the letters ARC followed by three numbers.The three numbers represent the current radial that you are on relative to the reference VOR/DME. The arc radial is forced into this position when the aircraft is 30 NM from the arc. The  ARCdisplay is shown in figure 5-24. Just watch this value and when it reads the same as one of the step-down points you can descend as necessary. This particular example does not have such points, but there are quite a few approaches that do.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-25Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-25Approaches and SID/STARs 5-26Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5NOTE:Autopilot performance may not be satisfactory if coupled inthe NAV mode while flying the arc.  Many autopilots were never  designed to fly curved paths.  If autopilot performance is not satisfac-  tory while flying DME arcs, select the HDG mode and keep changing the heading bug to keep the D-bar centered.12.As the aircraft approaches the end of the arc, the KLN 89B will provide waypoint alerting and turn anticipation to the next leg.13.When the aircraft is 2 NM from FOW VOR, the FAF, the KLN 89B will attempt to transition to the approach active mode.  Since  the DME arc procedure is flown entirely in the LEG mode the only possible problem would be if the integrity monitoring did not check out.14.The visual descent point is identified by the along track dis- tance to the MAP to be 1.5 NM. When the aircraft reaches this point (figure 5-26), and the run- way environment is in sight, it is possible to descend for a landing.If a missed approach is needed use the following steps: 15.The missed approach calls for a climb to 2000 and then a left turn direct to FOW.  The KLN 89B will not automatically  sequence past the MAP.16.Once 2000 feet has been reached press  , the missedapproach holding point will be the default direct to waypoint. Press to confirm the direct to waypoint and proceed to the FOW VOR.NOTE:If ATC gives you instructions for a missed approach that isdifferent from the published missed approach procedure, it is always possible for you to select a different direct to waypoint than the default direct to waypoint.17.The OBS mode will need to be selected to accomplish the hold- ing pattern.  If this is not done before the aircraft is 4 NM from  FOW, the KLN 89B will provide a message reminding you to select the OBS mode.APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-26NOTE:If another attempt at the approach is desired after holding, itis necessary to manually change the active waypoint. When the FAF and the missed approach holding point are at the same place then the KLN 89B will automatically change the active waypoint to the FAF when you change from OBS to LEG. Make sure to make this change as soon as possible to ensure you get into the approach active mode.5.1.9.   APPROACH PROBLEMSVery rarely there will be a problem with the integrity of the GPS sys- tem while you are conducting non-precision approaches with the KLN 89B.  In some cases the KLN 89B will determine that there will not be  sufficient integrity monitoring for the leg between the FAF and the MAP, or RAIM is not currently available. In these cases the KLN 89B will not go into the approach active mode and will present the follow- ing message:*RAIM Not AvailableAPR Mode Inhibited Predict RAIM on OTH 3In these cases you will not be able to finish the approach becausethere is insufficient integrity monitoring. The OTH 3 (Other 3) page provides a means for you to predict when RAIM will be available.  To perform a RAIM prediction on the OTH 3 page two pieces of infor- mation are needed.  The first is the location that the prediction will be  for and the second is the time for the prediction.The destination waypoint will, by default, be the missed approachpoint of an approach loaded in the flight plan. If there is no approach in the flight plan, then the default waypoint is the last waypoint in the active flight plan. Of course it is possible for you to enter any way- point in this field.The time used for the RAIM prediction will be the current ETA to the destination airport or the MAP. This time is automatically updated by the KLN 89B so there is usually no need to enter a value. If you are making a RAIM calculation for planning purposes, it is also possible to enter a time in this field. An important point about this time is that  the time used for RAIM prediction is always in the future and limited  to 24 hours from the present time. For example, if the time is now  19:30 and the time entered for the ETA is 18:30, then the prediction will be made for the next day not one hour ago.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-27Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5To perform a manual RAIM calculation:1.Turn the left outer and inner knobs to select the OTH 3 page.  2.Press  .  The cursor will be over the RAIM @Destfield.3.Enter the desired waypoint identifier by using the inner and outer knobs just like you do for any other waypoint entry.4.Once the desired waypoint identifier is entered (figure 5-27), press .  Press  again ifthe waypoint information is  correct.5.The cursor will now be over the ETA field. Use the inner knob to enter the desired hour.  Note  that the current time zone is displayed next to the ETA field. Use the outer knob to move the cursor over the minutes field. Use the inner and outer knobs to select tens of minutes and single min- utes as required.  When the desired time is selected press  .The RAIM calculations will start.6.The RAIM calculation will usually take a few seconds before an answer is reached.  During this  time the OTH 3 page will be as shown in figure 5-28.7.Once the RAIM calculation is complete, the OTH 3 page will indi- cate the results of the test.An example is shown in figure 5-29 and 5-30. RAIM is available from 15  minutes before ETA until 5 minutes after ETA. However, RAIM is predict-  ed not to be available from then until  15 minutes after the ETA. By showing the times when RAIM will be available it is possible for you to how to alter your ETA to ensure that there will not be any RAIM problems.Even more rare will be the case whenthe KLN 89B cannot provide sufficient integrity monitoring or if there is an actual satellite failure while the air- craft is on the leg from the FAF to the MAP.

This will change the unit to the  approach-arm mode and navigation information will be restored.5.2.  SID/STAR PROCEDURES The KLN 89B allows access to navigation SIDs (Standard Instrument Departures) and STARs (Standard Terminal Arrival Routes) by  SID/STAR name. SID/STAR procedures stored in the data base can only be considered accurate as long as the data base is current. Even though the data base contains SID and STAR procedures, there is a lot of information that is not included in the data base. Therefore, the paper chart is still the primary source of information. For example, many procedures require the aircraft to fly to a certain altitude, along a heading until intercepting a course, and many other procedures that the KLN 89B can not automatically accomplish. Many procedures require pilot action to ensure that the proper path is flown over the ground. The main purpose of loading a SID or a STAR into the active flight plan is to provide you with a quick way of loading a potentially large number of waypoints.SID and STAR procedures can be as challenging to fly as some approaches are. Therefore it is mandatory that you are comfortable with the operation of the KLN 89B before attempting to fly SID and STAR procedures. In particular, flight plan operation and the OBS mode should be second nature to you. NOTE:There are some SID/STAR procedures in the world that arenot suited for the operational characteristics of the KLN 89B.  These  procedures are not included in the data base and therefore the way- points that make up these procedures would have to be entered manually.  It is good preflight practice ensure that the KLN 89B con-  tains anticipated procedures for the flight.SID and STAR procedures are stored with the airport for which theyapply.  SID and STAR procedures are accessed through the APT 7  page.  If there are both SIDs and STARs for a given airport, then  there will be two APT 7 pages, one to select a SID and the other to select a STAR.  This is indicated by APT+7.  It is also possible to  have only a SID or only a STAR in which case there is only one APT 7 page.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-29Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5SID and STAR procedures are defined in three parts.  The parts are the SID or STAR name (e.g., PORTE9), a transition (e.g., Fellows), and a runway specific component (e.g., RW 01L).  The APT 7 pages  lead you through the selection process.5.2.1.  SELECTING A SID Use the following procedure to select a SID.  Some steps may not be necessary depending on the procedure that you wish to fly.  For this  example, the PORTE NINE departure from San Francisco  International (KSFO) will be used.To select a SID: 1.Select KSFO on one of the airport pages (figure 5-31).  If you are  operating from an active flight plan you can use the ACT 7 page for KSFO by scanning through the active flight plan (see section 4.2.3).2.If not already displayed, rotate the right inner knob until the APT 7 page appears as in figure 5-32. Make sure that  ÒSIDÓ is displayed in the upper right corner of the display. This will allow the selec- tion of SID procedures.3.Turn the cursor on by pressing , and rotate the right outerknob until the flashing cursor is over PORTE9(figure 5-33).

Review these waypoints if  desired. If the waypoints look cor- rect then press  with thecursor over ADD TO FPL 0? toload the SID into the active flight plan (figure 5-36).7.The KLN 89B will then add the SID procedure after the airport reference point in the active flightplan (figure 5-37).  If the airport reference point is not included in  the active flight plan, then the KLN 89B will ask to add this way- point to the active flight plan.Section 5.2.4 gives the actions required to fly this SID.  5.2.2.   SELECTING A STAR The steps required to select a STAR are very similar to those required to select a SID. The only difference is the order of the steps to define the STAR and where the STAR is loaded into the flight plan. The steps required to define Acton Four arrival with the Wink transi- tion serve as an example of how to select a STAR. This STAR is to the Dallas/Fort Worth International airport (KDFW).To select a STAR: 1.Select KDFW on one of the airport pages (figure 5-38).  If you  are operating from an active flight  plan you can use the ACT 7 page for KDFW by scanning through the active flight plan (see section 4.2.3).2.Turn to the APT 7 page for KDFW.  Make sure that  ÒSTARÓ is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-31Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-36APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-37APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    Figure 5-38APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   -1+Figure 5-353.Turn the cursor on by pressing the , and, if necessary, rotatethe right outer knob until the flashing cursor is over the desired STAR.

For this example select INK(figure 5-40) and press .5.In some cases, the STAR proce- dure requires you to select a specific runway. To select a specific runway move the cursor over the desired runway and press .In this example the STAR does  not require a specific runway so the KLN 89B skips this step.6.The KLN 89B now presents a list of waypoints that make up the STAR (figure 5-41).  Review  these waypoints if desired and then press to load the STARinto the active flight plan.7.The KLN 89B will then add the STAR procedure before the air- port reference point in the active flight plan (figure 5-42).  If the  airport reference point is not included in the active flight plan, then the KLN 89B will ask to add this waypoint to the active flight plan.NOTE:It is not possible to load a SID or STAR into a flight plan otherthan FPL 0. Furthermore, SID and STAR procedures are deleted  from FPL0 after the power is off for more than 5 minutes. 5.2.3.  EDITING A SID OR STARFrom the proceeding two examples you may have noticed that SIDand STAR procedures have procedure ÒheadersÓ just as approaches do. It is possible to use these headers to delete and change the entire procedure just like is done with approach procedures. One dif- ference between SID and STAR procedures and approaches is that it is possible to add waypoints to and delete waypoints from the pub-Approaches and SID/STARs 5-32Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH a Figure 5-39APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH    aFigure 5-40APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-41APT   VOR   NDB   INT   USR   ACT   NAV   FPL   CAL   SET   OTH   Figure 5-42lished procedure. To help you differentiate between approaches (noadding or deleting waypoints allowed) and SID or STAR procedures (adding and deleting waypoints allowed) the waypoint number has a period (.) next to it instead of a blank space. The period also differen-tiates a SID or STAR waypoint from a  ÒregularÓ waypoint that has a colon (:) next to the waypoint number.  To add an individual waypoint in the SID or STAR procedure: 1.Use the right knobs to select the FPL 0 page.  2.Turn the cursor on by pressing the  .  Rotate the right outer knob as necessary to position the cursor over the waypoint iden- tifier which you desire to  follow the waypoint being added.3.Use the right inner and outer knobs in the normal manner to define the desired waypoint.4.Press  to display the waypoint page for this identifier. If thewaypoint is correct, then press a second time to confirm the waypoint page. The new waypoint is added to the waypoints that make up the SID or STAR procedure.To delete an individual waypoint in a SID or STAR procedure: 1.Use the right knobs to select the FPL 0 page.  2.Rotate the right outer knob to place the cursor over the waypoint to be deleted.3.Press  . The letters DEL(delete) will appear to the left of theidentifier and a question mark will appear to the right of the identifier.4.If this is the desired waypoint to delete, then press  .  If it is not the desired waypoint, press .NOTE:Adding waypoints to or deleting waypoints from SID or STARprocedures does not change the way that they are stored in the pub- lished data base.To change or delete an entire SID or STAR procedure from the active flight plan:1.Use the right knobs to select the FPL 0 page.  2.Turn the cursor on by pressing the  .

EXAMPLE OF A SID PROCEDURETo illustrate the use of the KLN 89B with a SID, the Porte Nine departure loaded into the flight plan in section 5.2.1 will be used. Remember that ÒRW01BÓ was selected meaning that the procedure is applicable to both runways 1L and 1R. The Fellows (FLW) transition was also selected. This procedure is one of the more difficult that you are likely to come across.  Most procedures are not  this difficult, but this SID serves as a good example for what steps to take when you encounter a difficult procedure.To fly this procedure use the following steps and refer to the chart forthis SID (figure 5-43):1.Load the SID as described in section 5.2.1.  2.The procedure states  ÒIntercept and proceed via SFO R-350,cross the 4 DME fix at or above 1600Õ...Ó. To accomplish this por-tion of the SID, put the KLN 89B into the OBS mode with SFO04 as the active waypoint and make 350¡the selected course. It iseasiest to accomplish these steps before take-off. SFO04 is the waypoint that is 4 DME from the SFO VORTAC and 350 ¡is theinbound course to this fix. After take-off climb to 1600 Õ as required by the SID.3.Once the aircraft reaches SFO04, turn left to a heading of 200 ¡.At this point it is necessary to manually change the active way- point to ÒPORTEÓ. This is done easily from either the NAV 4 pageor from the FPL 0 page. In either case, once PORTE is highlighted by the cursor, press to bring up the direct topage.4.Press  to confirm PORTE as the direct to waypoint.5.Change the selected course on the HSI or CDI to the new value of 135¡. As required by the SID, continue flying a heading of 200¡until the HSI or CDI needle centers and then fly to keep the needle centered and fly to PORTE.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-34Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-35Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Figure 5-436.Before reaching PORTE, change back to the Leg mode to enable automatic waypoint sequencing. Once the aircraft reaches PORTE the KLN 89B will automatically sequence to the next way- point, PESCA.7.After passing PESCA, the procedure calls for a 090 ¡heading untilintercepting the 116¡course to WAGES intersection. To do this with the KLN 89B, change back to the OBS mode and make sure that WAGES is the active waypoint.  Set the selected course to  116¡.8.Before reaching WAGES change to the Leg mode.  This will allow automatic waypoint sequencing upon reaching WAGES.9.There is an altitude restriction marked with an  ÒxÓ on the chart. The name of this point is 26FLW. 26FLW means that the waypoint  is 126 NM from the FLW VOR/DME. Make sure to meet any alti-  tude requirements upon reaching this waypoint.10.Once the aircraft reaches FLW, proceed on with the rest of the flight plan as required.5.2.5.  EXAMPLE OF A STAR PROCEDURE To illustrate the use of the KLN 89B with STAR procedures the stepsrequired to fly Acton Four arrival to Dallas/Fort Worth International will be shown in this section.  This procedure is considerably simpler than  the SID example shown in section 5.2.4.  For this example assume that the aircraft departs from El Paso, Texas and files for the Acton Four arrival with the Wink transition. Use the fol- lowing steps to fly this procedure with the KLN 89B and refer to the chart for this STAR (figure 5-44):1.Load the STAR into the flight plan as described in section 5.2.2.  2.This STAR is very simple and the KLN 89B will automatically guide the aircraft along the proper route until the AQN VOR. 3.Long before reaching AQN examine this procedure and notice that there are two different routes depending on what type of air- craft is flying the STAR. Turbojets fly to CREEK intersection while non-turbojets fly to RENDY intersection. The data base in the KLN 89B has the sequence of waypoints for the turbojet procedure  NOT the sequence for non-turbojets.NOTE:It is extremely rare to have a different path over the ground forturbojets and non-turbojets, but be sure to cross check with your paper charts.Approaches and SID/STARs 5-36Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5If the aircraft you are flying in is a turbojet, then fly the rest of the STAR as depicted on the chart with no changes to the flight plan. If the aircraft is not a turbojet then follow these steps:4.Turn to the FPL 0 page and delete the following waypoints: MARKUM, BRYAR, HULEN, FLATO, and CREEK.  To do this  turn on the cursor and rotate the right outer knob until the cursor is over one of the above waypoints.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideApproaches and SID/STARs 5-37Approaches and SID/STARsChapter 5Figure 5-445.Press  and then to delete a waypoint.6.Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all of the unnecessary waypoints are deleted.7.Now add JERRY, CRESN, and RENDY to FPL 0 by using the right inner and outer knobs and as necessary.8.The rest of the STAR can now be flown.

Change the track (heading) of the aircraft so that the actual track does intercept the DME arc and try again.No NrstÐ (No Nearest)  Appears when the pilot selects a nearest list (APT, VOR, NDB, INT, USR, SUA, FSS or CTR), and there are no nearest items of that type within a 200 nm radius of the aircraft Õs pre-sent position.NoSuchWptÑ (No Such Waypoint) Appears when there is no waypoint in the data base corresponding to the entered identifier on the Supplemental Waypoint page.RemrksFullÑ (Remarks Full) Appears when you attempt to create a user- entered Airport or Supplemental Waypoint remark on the APT 6 or SUP 3 page if 100 user-entered remarks already exist.  In order to  create additional airport remarks, some existing remarks must be deleted on the OTH 4 page.UsedIn FplÑ (Used in Flight Plan) Appears when you attempt to delete a user-defined waypoint on the OTH 4 page if the waypoint is used in a flight plan.  Either this waypoint must be deleted from the flight plan or the entire flight plan must be deleted before this waypoint can be deleted from the user-defined waypoint list.USR DBFullÑ (User Data Base Full) Appears when you attempt to create a user-defined waypoint if the user data base already contains 500 waypoints.  In order to create additional user-defined waypoints, it will  first be necessary to delete existing user-defined waypoints on the  OTH 4 page.AppendixC-2Scratchpad MessagesAppendix CAPPENDIX D - ABBREVIATIONS STATE ABBREVIATIONS ABBREVIATIONSTATEAKAlaska ALAlabama  ARArkansas  AZArizona  CACalifornia  COColorado  CTConnecticut  DCDistrict of Columbia  DEDelaware  FLFlorida  GAGeorgia  IAIowa  IDIdaho  ILIllinois  INIndiana  KSKansas  KYKentucky  LALouisiana  MAMassachusetts  MDMaryland  MEMaine  MIMichigan  MNMinnesota  MOMissouri  MSMississippi  MTMontana  NCNorth Carolina  NDNorth Dakota  NENebraska  NHNew Hampshire  NJNew Jersey  NMNew Mexico  NVNevada  NYNew York  OHOhio  OKOklahoma KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAppendix D-1AbbreviationsAppendix DSTATE ABBREVIATIONS (ContÕd) OROregon PAPennsylvania  RIRhode Island  SCSouth Carolina  SDSouth Dakota  TNTennessee  TXTexas  UTUtah  VAVirginia  VTVermont  WAWashington  WIWisconsin  WVWest Virginia  WYWyoming CANADIAN PROVINCE ABBREVIATIONS ABBREVIATIONPROVINCEABAlberta  BCBritish Columbia  MBManitoba  NBNew Brunswick  NFNewfoundland  NSNova Scotia  NT & NUNorthwest Territory  ONOntario  PEPrince Edward Island  PQQuebec  SKSaskatchewan  YKYukon COUNTRY ABBREVIATIONS ABBREVIATIONCOUNTRYAFGAfghanistan  AGOAngola  AIAAnguilla Isl.

The system is, however, avail-  able to all civilian users free of charge.  GPS provides extremely  precise position, velocity, and time information.The satellites are not geosynchronous, as is the case with manyweather and television satellites.  That is, each satellite is not above a fixed spot on the Earth all the time, but rather is continuously moving across the sky.  In fact, each satellite completely orbits the Earth two  times per day.The Department of Defense imposes an intentional accuracy degra-dation of the GPS system.  This degradation is known as Selective  Availability (SA).  When SA is active, only U.S. military users have  access to full GPS accuracy.  For civilian users, position accuracy is  degraded to no worse than 100 meters.  At the time of this writing,  Selective Availability is on (and therefore accuracy is degraded) near- ly 100% of the time.GPS POSITION DETERMINING CONCEPTThe technique used to determine position is fundamentally very sim-ple.  The complicated part is accounting for and correcting all the  possible errors in the position.The GPS receiver is able to determine the time it takes a radio signalto travel from the satellite to the GPS antenna.  Since this radio signal travels at the speed of light (approximately 186,000 statute miles per second), the time delay can very easily be used to determine the receiverÕs distance from a given satellite.  If measurements are taken from four satellites (or three satellites and an input from an aircraft altimeter), the receiver can identify its position very precisely.KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAppendix F F-1GPS PrimerAppendix FFor example, the GPS receiver might determine that it is exactly12,000 miles from satellite A, 12,700 miles from satellite B, and 13,100 miles from satellite C.  At the same time, the aircraft Õs encod-ing altimeter might be indicating an altitude of 9,500 feet MSL.  There  is only one point in space that satisfies these four measurements.GPS DATA SIGNALS Two of the primary types of signals that the GPS satellites broadcast are almanac and ephemeris data.  These signals enable the GPS  receiver to quickly lock on to the satellites in view.  Otherwise, the  receiver would have to look for each of the 24 satellites to determine which ones could be used.Almanac data is very crude data which describes the approximateorbital position of the satellites.  Each of the 24 satellites transmits the almanac data for all satellites, so a GPS receiver has only to listen to one satellite in order to know which satellites are ÒvisibleÓ (in the sky) at that particular time.  Almanac data is good for about six months, so  when you turn the receiver off, then back on a month later, it will know what satellites to look for.Ephemeris data is very precise data which each satellite transmits totell the GPS receiver exactly where it is and what its orbital parame- ters will be for about the next four hours.  Each satellite transmits its  own unique ephemeris data.Appendix FF-2GPS PrimerAppendix F12,000 NM12,700 NM13,100 NM9500 FTMSLNOT TO SCALEN65108GPS SYSTEM SEGMENTSThe GPS system is composed of three segments: the SpaceSegment, the Control Segment, and the User Segment.The Space Segment consists of the 24 NAVSTAR satellites which orbit the earth at an altitude of 10,898 nautical miles. The satellite orbits are very precisely planned so that the entire surface of the earth may use the GPS system 24 hours a day, every day.  There  are almost always more than six satellites in view from anywhere on Earth.The Control Segment consists of a network of ground-based monitor-ing and control stations.  The Master Control Station is located in  Colorado Springs, Colorado.  All satellite data which is collected by  the other ground stations is assimilated and analyzed at Colorado  Springs.  Based on these analyses, ephemeris updates (such as sys-  tem clock corrections) are sent (uplinked) to the satellites through  radio transmitters at the ground stations.  These ground stations are  located at Kwajalein (west of Hawaii in the central Pacific Ocean), Diego Garcia (in the Indian Ocean), and Ascension (in the south Atlantic Ocean).As an owner of a GPS system, you can now claim to be a certifiedmember of the GPS User Segment!  GPS has many users and uses,  and more are being dreamed up all the time.  Not only are aircraft  using GPS navigation, so are military systems and personnel, boaters, hikers, and surveyors.  Personal automobiles and transport  trucks use Intelligent Transportation Systems, or ITS, to find their destinations, and track their movements.  Some biologists attach  GPS receivers to animals to monitor their movement and migration patterns.  Geologists even use GPS to track the movement of glaci-  ers and to analyze plate tectonics (movements of the EarthÕs crust).What an exciting new technology as we move into the 21st Century!RAIMReceiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is a function that every IFR-certified GPS receiver must continuously perform to assure an accurate position.  One characteristic of the GPS Space and  Control Segments is that they canÕt instantly fix a satellite if it beginssending misleading positioning information.  For this reason, a GPS  receiver canÕt rely on the GPS satellites to tell it when there is a pos-sible error.  The words  Òreceiver autonomousÓ indicate that the GPS KLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideAppendix F F-3GPS PrimerAppendix Freceiver, on itÕs own, can detect an inaccuracy in the GPS system.  It does this by using distance measurements from as many satellites as possible to check the consistency of the position (this is called an over-determined position solution).If there are not enough satellites in view to assure the position integri-ty, the KLN 89(B) notifies the pilot.  Five measurements with good  geometry (relative positions of the satellites) are needed to provide  RAIM.  This means that at least five satellites or four satellites and a  pressure altitude input from the aircraftÕs altimeter are required toassure RAIM availability. Likewise, if this check shows some incon- sistency in the position, the KLN 89(B) notifies the user that other navigation sources should be used to cross-check the position.  Additionally, sometimes the receiver is unable to assure the position to enough accuracy for the phase of flight, due to the location of the satellites at that instant.RAIM availability is very seldom a difficulty when in the en route andterminal phases of navigation.  The allowable limits are much tighter  when a non-precision approach is performed with a KLN 89B.  For  this reason, the KLN 89B Other (OTH) 3 page allows the pilot to enter a time and location, and the GPS receiver will predict if RAIM will be available to shoot the non-precision approach.  See section 5.1.9 for  more information about the RAIM prediction capability.GPS XPRESSªCARD 8-CHANNEL RECEIVER The KLN 89 and KLN 89B use an Honeywell GPS receiver known as the GPS Xpressªcard.  It was dubbed this way because it is identi- cal in size to an everyday credit card, and its faster acquisition time than previous single-channel designs.  The GPS receiver has eight  parallel channels, which means each channel can continuously track a satellite, for continuous tracking of up to eight GPS satellites.  The  parallel receiver design has several advantages:¥Excellent performance during high dynamic conditions (highvelocity and/or acceleration).¥Improved position acquisition time (also known as time-to-first-fix) over single-channel designs.¥Improved position accuracy.¥The ability of the GPS receiver to perform the RAIM calcula- tions is enhanced without degrading position tracking.Appendix FF-4GPS PrimerAppendix FKLN 89/KLN 89B  PilotÕs GuideIndex I-1IndexKLN 89(B) INDEXAAbbreviations Airport names 3-25, 3-45 ARTCC/FIR D-8 Canadian Province D-2  Communication frequencies 3-49 Country D-2  GPS receiver state 3-62 Other abbreviations D-17 State D-1  Time zones 3-5ACT (Active waypoint pages) 4-11 Activating Numbered flight plan 4-4 Waypoint in the OBS mode 4-39Actual track 3-38, 3-43, A-1 Adding waypoints to flight plan 4-2 Air data pages 4-44 Airport data Bearing and distance 3-46 City, State (or country) 3-45 Communication frequencies 3-49 Fuel availability 3-47 Identifier 2-4 Instrument approach availability 3-47 Latitude/longitude 3-46 Military 3-45 Name 3-45 Nearest 3-27, 3-46 Radar capability 3-47 Remarks 3-50 Runway information 3-48Airport waypoint pages 3-45 Airspeed 4-27, 4-28 Alarm 4-26 Alerting Altitude 4-14 Special Use Airspace (SUA) 3-68 Voltage, avionics bus 3-67 Waypoint 3-35, 4-9Almanac 3-18, 3-63, F-2Altitude Alerting 4-14 Density 4-27 Indicated 3-2, 3-58, 4-26 Input 1-1, 3-58 Minimum en route safe (ESA) 3-59 Minimum safe (MSA) 3-59 Pages 3-58, 4-14, 4-17 Pressure 3-58, 4-26, 4-27, 4-28Annunciators, remote 3-66, 5-1 Antenna 1-1  Approach active (ACTV) mode 5-4 Approach armed (ARM) mode 5-4 Approaches Changing 5-9 Deleting 5-9 Loading 5-6 Selecting 5-5APT 1 Name, City page 3-45 APT 2 Lat, Lon, distance page 3-46 APT 3 Airspace, timezone, apr type page 3-47 APT 4 Runways, Rnwy length page 3-48 APT 5 VHF frequencies page 3-49 APT 6 pilot remarks page 3-50 APT 7 departures, arrivals page 3-51 APT 8 approaches page 3-52 ARTCC (ÒCenterÓ) Abbreviations D-8 Frequencies 3-31AUTO map scale 3-42, 5-21 Autopilot 1-1 BBaro set 3-2, 3-58 Battery 2-8 Bearing to waypoint 3-36, 3-38, 3-45 Brightness;

OPERATIONAL EVALUATION    5.1  History   The airplane was originally developed in Israel and certified both in Israel and the USA as   IAI-1126/GALAXY in December 1998. After it™s cert ification, the FAA conducted a FSB evaluation of  the IAI Galaxy, but this evaluation was of a limited  scope, i.e. Type Rating determination, training,  checking and currency requirements.    General Dynamics, parent company of Gulfstream Aerospace, acquired the IAI Galaxy in 2001 and   the aircraft was renamed Gulfstream G200. Significant modifications to the airplane were introduced  over the years, which followed.  Gulfstream applied for and obtained an EASA Type Certificate in 2004.    Gulfstream™s G200 is manufactured in Israel and flown to Dallas, TX for the final phase before delivery  to clients (ﬁcompletionﬂ).       5.2  Overview   The G200 is a swept wing executiv e aircraft, designed for a maximum of 18 passengers, however, a  typical outfitting is for 8-10 passengers and 2 cockpit crew.     The MTOW  of the G200 is 16,080 kg (35,450 lbs) in the basic AFM  or 16,170 kg (35,650 lb under  Supplement 12). It is capable of cruise speeds up to Mach 0.85 (M mo) at a maximum altitude of 45,000  ft MSL.      The aircraft is equipped with two Pratt & Whitney 306A engines. Take off thrust rating is 6040 pounds  per engine. The engines incorporate a Digital Electr onic Engine Control system and thrust reversers,  while an Auto-Throttle system is optional equipment.    The cockpit is equipped with a Collins ProLine 4 EFIS system and dual Collins FMS    5.3  Process    The catch-up evaluation of the G200 consis ted of a number of distinct steps:    Evaluation             Completion of draft report      Presentation of draft report   Incorporate comments.   These steps were completed in July-August 2008.      The evaluation  was performed by obtaining information on Type Rating training courses already  approved and in use and comparing the outline of these courses with the requirements in JAR-FCL  and EU-OPS.    After this evaluation, a  draft  report  was completed and distributed to prepare for the formal  presentation.    The manufacturer was invited to raise comments on the draft report.  These comments were  incorporated  in the final version of the report.   The JOEB should be involved in conducting future  evaluations of the G200 aircraft, its derivatives and  of all changes to the aircraft, such as software modifications and/or the addition of new systems. The   Board will then determine the associated impact on  training, checking and currency and will amend  this report accordingly.

In accordance with the provisions in JAR-FCL a Single License Endorsement is assigned to   the G200. The License Endorsement is:  G200.    2.  The initial Type Rating training course as described in paragraph 8 is recommended for  approval as a minimum.   3. Special attention should be given to the pre-requisite requirements for candidate-pilots.    4.  Some items require special emphasis during training. They are mentioned in paragraph 10.   6. An EASA/JAA MMEL was not offered for evaluation during this JOEB process. The FAA    MMEL is available for consultation on the website www.opspecs.com .

OPERATOR DIFFERENCE REQUIREMENTS     Operator Difference Requirements (ODR™s) for the G200 do not apply at this time.   Paragraph is reserved for possible future variants.                                                       European Aviation Safety Agency/Joint Aviation Authorities   Joint Operational Evaluation Board - Gulfstream G200 ﬁcatch-up ﬁ  Issue 0  25 September 2008  11 8. INITIAL TYPE RATING TRAINING COURSE   8.1 TRAINING   The G200 Type Rating training course was evaluated.   The training course, which is described in more  detail in APPENDIX 3 is recommended by EASA/JAA  as the minimum for initial Type Rating qualification training and checking (JAR-FCL), as well as for the  relevant portion of Conversion training and checking (EU-OPS).  The course was verified to fulfill the requirements  of JAR-FCL AMC 1.261 (c) (2) in an acceptable way .   This Type Rating training course is an intense and demanding course. Additional training should be  considered for pilots without any previous experience with EFIS and FMS.   The safe operation of the airplane is predicated upon  the awareness, at all times and of both pilots, of  the airplane™s Flight Modes and flight parameters.  Strict adherence to Crew Coordination Procedures  (CCP™s) in normal, as well as in abnormal situations is essential and should be regarded as  mandatory. These CCP™s, specific to aircraft type and to operator, should be fully integrated in the   training. The Training Organization, therefore, should be made aware of the specific Crew  Coordination Procedures as established by the operator, before training is started. Pilots having no  relevant experience with the app lication of Crew Coordination Proc edures will benefit from a bridge- course on this topic.   Pilots having no relevant experience with the operation of an integrated Avionics, Flight Management  System and Flight Guidance System, like the Collins Pr o-Line 4 suite, will benefit from a bridge-course  on this topic.   These specific additional courses should ideally be completed before the Full Flight Simulator training  phase.      Emergency procedures are an essential part of the training curriculum. To avoid confusion during  training, as well as during actual operations, the Training Organization and the candidate pilots need   to be made aware of the items to be performed without immediate reference to the checklist. These  steps should be defined before training is started,  preferably by the operator as part of its Standard  Operating Procedures.   Further areas of special emphasis are covered in a separate paragraph (10).     EASA/JAA recommends to include Line Flying Under Supervision in the conversion training program  and to follow the requirements of EU-OPS 1.945, including Appendix 1 (Conversion training and  checking) and EU-OPS 1.955 (Nomination as commander).       8.2 CHECKING    Ground school examination and Type Rating skill test  have to comply with JAR-FCL 1.240, 1.261 and  1.262 and the related appendices.      8.3 FLIGHT SIMULATOR   One of the two  G200 Flight Simulators at FlightSafety in Dallas, TX was evaluated in January/February   2008 by an evaluation team of Germany (LBA). Qual ification to level D was issued (Certificate nr.   DE-1A-060Z/CU.        European Aviation Safety Agency/Joint Aviation Authorities   Joint Operational Evaluation Board - Gulfstream G200 ﬁcatch-up ﬁ  Issue 0  25 September 2008  12 9. DIFFERENCES TRAINING COURSE      Difference training does not apply, as the G200 is a separate type. The JOEB did not conduct any   evaluation of possible credits to be taken into a ccount when training from another type to the G200.  Paragraph reserved for future variants                                                         European Aviation Safety Agency/Joint Aviation Authorities   Joint Operational Evaluation Board - Gulfstream G200 ﬁcatch-up ﬁ  Issue 0  25 September 2008  13 10. SPECIAL EMPHASIS TRAINING    The JOEB has identified several aircraft systems and/or procedures (listed below) that should receive  special emphasis in an approved G200 Training Program:   Systems Integration Training:   Primary Flight Display (PFD).   EICAS.   Flight Guidance System (FGS).   Flight Management System (FMS).    Flight Training (Full Flight Simulator - Level C or D and/or aircraft):   Dual Generator Failure procedure.   Loss of cabin pressure procedures.   Instrument flying on standby instruments   Fuel leaks.   Smoke procedures, including smoke removal    The JOEB recommends early exposure to the FCP, FMA and FMS, especially for pilots with no  previous EFIS or FMS experience. Establishing ear ly confidence in manually flying the aircraft,  converting from manual to automatic (FMS controlled) flight mode and back is equally important due to   heavy reliance on the Automatic Flight Control System  (AFCS). In the event of a flight path deviation  due to input error or system malfunction, the flight crew must be able to comfortably transition from  automatic to manual mode and back in an orderly fashion.                                     European Aviation Safety Agency/Joint Aviation Authorities   Joint Operational Evaluation Board - Gulfstream G200 ﬁcatch-up ﬁ  Issue 0  25 September 2008  14 11. RECURRENT TRAINING/CHECKING   Recurrent training and currency serve to maintain a pilot™s continued competency for the operational  tasks to be performed. During proficiency checks this competency is established.   It is every operator™s responsibility to establish a recurrent training and proficiency checking program,  approved by the National Authority, which is relevant to the type of airplane and the intended  operation.    The requirements for a recurrent training program may vary with several factors which have a  significant influence. Some of these factors are: actu al exposure of the flight crew member(s), specific  routes and aerodromes used by the operator and new developments in technology. These factors  and/or a combination thereof will determine how much recurrent training will actually be required.    It is recommended to follow the requirements of EU-OPS, subpart N, paragraph 1.965 as a minimum  and to consider expansion, as appropriate, of these requirements for pilots, who have had only limited  exposure and/or who do not any longer fulfill the currency requirements.                                                   European Aviation Safety Agency/Joint Aviation Authorities   Joint Operational Evaluation Board - Gulfstream G200 ﬁcatch-up ﬁ  Issue 0  25 September 2008  15 12. RECENT EXPERIENCE   There are no specific currency requirements applicable to the G200, beyond those of EU-OPS,  Subpart N, paragraph 1.970 for AOC holders or JAR-FCL 1.026 and 1.245 for private operators.                                                         European Aviation Safety Agency/Joint Aviation Authorities   Joint Operational Evaluation Board - Gulfstream G200 ﬁcatch-up ﬁ  Issue 0  25 September 2008  16 13. CABIN CREW REQUIREMENTS     There is no requirement for cabin crew to be carried on the G200 and the JOEB did not assess an   EASA/JAA any cabin crew issue for the G200.  The JOEB recommends that, if any are carried, they  are fully trained in accordance with EU-OPS 1  Subpart O.

Readers   and front line managers who may need or want more details of  the problem, research and analysis, and a complete listing of  findings and recommendations can refer to the full report that  follows. 3.1 The Go-Around Noncompliance Problem Approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for   aviation accidents, accounting annually for approximately 65  percent of all accidents. A Flight Safety Foundation study of  16 years of runway excursions determined that 83 percent  could have been avoided with a decision to go around. In  other words, 54 percent of  all accidents could potentially be  prevented by going around. It is generally felt that an unstable   approach is the primary cause of landing excursions. However,  within this 16-year period, just over half of the landing excur -sions followed a fully stable approach; in these instances,  the flight became unstable only during landing. A critical  industry policy designed to help prevent such accidents is  the go-around policy. Interestingly, and sadly, the collective  industry performance of complying with go-around policies  is extremely poor Š approximately 3 percent of unstable  approaches result in go-around policy compliance. Why is a  critical policy designed to prevent the most common type of  accident ignored by flight crews, and why is that policy not  being managed effectively by management? Improving the   go-around compliance rate holds tremendous potential in re -ducing approach and landing accidents (ALAs). The go-around   itself is not without risk. There is an increased risk in loss of  control events during a go-around compared to exposure with  all other phases of flight. It follows that we should only go  around when the risk associated with an unstable approach  is greater than the risk associated with a go-around. What is  that balance, and how do we minimize go-around exposure to  only those that are really necessary? The Flight Safety Foun -dation Go-Around Decision-  Making and Execution Project was  launched to research and answer the question ﬁWhy are we  so poor at complying with established go-around policies?ﬂ It  was also intended to improve our understanding of the risks  associated with executing go-arounds and to make recom -mendations to improve compliance and mitigate risks associ -ated with the go-around maneuver itself. The full report includes complete research, analysis, find -ings, strategies and recommendations for industry corrective   action, and future work required. As such, it is meant as a  source for the development of easier-to-use operator refer -ence products such as guidelines and checklists. 3.2 Research and Analysis Many ALAs have been investigated thoroughly over time, and   much is known about contributing factors. What is lacking,  however, is an understanding of the psychology of noncompli -ance. Research and analysis of go-around decision making   have been conducted primarily from the psychosocial science  perspective to gain an understanding of the psychological  drivers of noncompliance, and to identify corrective steps that  can be taken, based on science. This is the first industry analy -sis of its type for this specific problem. The Presage Group   conducted the research and analysis, based on its situational   model of nine distinct constructs, or attributes, from two  global studies via web-based surveys; one survey analyzed  the psychology of noncompliance by flight crewmembers, and  the other examined the psychology of management™s actions  in handling company go-around policies. Detailed analysis can  be found in the full report. For the go-around execution research, an accident and  incident review was conducted that included a non-random  selection of published accident and serious incident re -ports about go-around events involving transport category  aircraft between 2000 and 2012. A total of 64 go-around  events were included. In some, the safety of the go-around  was central to the accident or incident investigation; in oth -ers, the aftermath of the go-around was the main purpose of  the investigation. The events involved single-aisle jets (64  percent), twin turboprops (20 percent) and twin-aisle jets  (16 percent). The context, safety aspects and overall level of risk of each  event were analyzed and characterized by a review team.   Each event was assigned to one of three categories according  to the degree of risk presented by the go-around: high risk (18  events), moderate risk (25 events) and nonŒrisk-bearing (21  events). In the two risk-bearing categories, six ﬁheadlineﬂ go-around  safety issues (GASIs) were identified with respect to the initia -tion and conduct of each go-around. Most of the 43 risk-  bearing  events were associated with a single GASI, but five events were  associated with two GASIs. Each risk-bearing event also was  assigned one of three ﬁoutcome risksﬂ: loss of controlŒin flight,  controlled flight into terrain or midair collision. 3.3 Significant Findings An effective policy has three main attributes: It is well thought   out and clearly written to balance the needs of safety and  4 |mission accomplishment; company management handles the  policy consistently; and company front line employees™ aware -ness is such that the policy is carried out reliably. Research   revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the industry,  operator and employee levels. High-level significant findings are: 1. The collective industry norm is to accept the noncompli -ance of go-around polices, despite empirical data that   indicate this is the most common contributor to ALAs. 2. The industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable   approaches as the sole means to reduce ALAs, even  though empirical data show that unstable approaches  affect less than half of runway excursions. 3. Pilots™ overall awareness of ALA risks Š and of the impact   those risks have on approach and landing safety Š is low. 4. Management is generally disengaged from go-around  noncompliance and has low awareness of the impact it   has on ALAs. Management™s perception of risk is low. 5. Pilots do not see current go-around policy criteria as   realistic for the operational environment. 6. Effective go-around decision making in flight deck com - munication is low. 7. Go-arounds, although considered a normal flight maneu -ver, are rare. 8. As reported by flight crews, one in 10 go-arounds has a   potentially hazardous outcome, such as an aircraft perfor -mance exceedance. 9. There are variable go-around techniques and challenges,  depending on the point during the approach when the go- around begins. Procedures and training do not adequately   address many of these challenges. 10. Pilot experience in the aircraft type affects go-around   proficiency. 11. Go-around complexity, including complex controller radio   transmissions, can affect go-around proficiency. 3.4 Recommendations It is evident that the state of noncompliance has been steady   for many years and will remain steady unless changes are  made. First and foremost, the industry must improve its  awareness of the problem; a shift in focus and cultural norms  is required. It is believed that significant improvement is  attainable; however, the cultural shift will be easier if the  industry shifts collectively, as opposed to individual compa -nies attacking the issue on their own, as several are already   doing. As stated above, three key attributes of an effective policy  are: The policy makes operational sense to both the employees   who execute it and those who manage it; the policy is managed  effectively to a level that satisfies company objectives; and the  employees who should follow the policy are very aware of that  policy and the environment in which it is applied. As such, the   following recommendations touch upon these key attributes.  More detailed recommendations can be found in the full report. High-level strategic recommendations for go-around decision  making include the following: 1. Ensure the policy makes sense operationally. a. Update the stable approach definition and stable ap -proach height to maximize their relevance among flight  crews, and their manageability among management. b. Separate the stable approach definition and criteria   from decision-making criteria to improve aware -ness that these are two distinct aspects of go-around  policies, and that decision making is viable beyond  the defined approach phase. This separation does not   imply that these two distinct areas cannot meet at  points throughout the approach and landing; rather, it  is intended for developers of standard operating pro - cedures and communication procedures to break the  psychological attachment of these two aspects. 3. Manage the policy effectively. a. Operators set specific compliance rate targets (key  performance indicators), and establish initiatives to  achieve them. b. Amend industry and regulatory audit programs to   include standards and recommended practices that  address go-around noncompliance (GANC). 3. Increase situational awareness. a. Increase awareness of GANC and risks associated with  continuing to land when unstable, and the significant  impact that noncompliance has on ALAs among:i. Operator management; ii. Flight crews; iii. Industry and pilot associations;iv.  Regulators; and, v. Manufacturers. b. Enhance situational awareness (psychosocial aware -ness) to heighten flight crews™ awareness throughout  the approach and landing through: i. Policy and procedural enhancements; 5 |ii. Communication improvements; and, iii. Minimizing the subjectivity of go-around decision  making for the decision maker (e.g., the pilot flying  or captain) to mitigate those components of situ -ational awareness that compromise the pilot™s risk   assessment and decision-making ability. Each recommendation helps improve the psychological driv -ers that affect good decision making, and it is this objec -tive that the recommendations were specifically designed   to address. Although all strategic recommendations are  important and should be implemented as part of a holistic  approach, a few are worth highlighting. First, if an operator  has the means to install automated stable approach and land -ing alerting systems, it should be a priority. These systems   address many of the psychological issues associated with  noncompliance and could be the single most effective way  to improve go-around decisions. Second, management must  be more involved in managing the policy/problem Š an area   where management has been very much absent. Key steps  to be taken by management are to set go-around compliance  rate targets consistent with safety management system prin -ciples, and to investigate and follow up (non-punitively) on   each approach that continues to an unstable landing. Finally,  flight crew situational awareness needs to be improved Š  primarily through better communication throughout the  approach and landing, which can be achieved largely through  active communication techniques as part of standard operat -ing procedures. High-level strategic go-around execution recommendations: 1. Ensure that go-around training and awareness appropri -ately reflect different go-around execution risk scenarios. 2. Review go-around policy, procedures and documen -tation to maximize their effectiveness, clarity and   understanding.3. Ensure that low relevant experience of one or both crew  does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitoring during   approach, landing and go-around. As with any significant program change, desired, and  undesired, effects should be closely monitored by appropri -ate audit programs such as flight data analysis (FDA), line  operations safety audits (LOSA) or International Air Trans -port Association (IATA) Operational Safety Audits (IOSA). 3.5 Action Taken In light of the findings and recommendations, it is appar -ent that revisions are required to Flight Safety Foundation™s  ﬁRecommended Elements of a Stabilized Approachﬂ and  Safe  Landing Guidelines . Analysis indicates there are facets of that  guidance that are not optimal for effective decision making   and that may encourage go-arounds for approaches that may  be of very low risk. When this report was being published, the  analysis for such revisions had already taken place, but the  project review committee recommended an operational trial  before changes in the Foundation™s guidelines are formally   adopted. (See Appendices 10.3 and 10.4 for Flight Safety Foun -dation™s ﬁNew Stabilized Approach and Go-Around Guidelines,   2017 (proposed for industry validation)ﬂ and ﬁRevised Safe  Landing Guidelines, 2017 (proposed for industry validation).ﬂ 3.6 Project Conclusion (Executive Report) The problem of go-around policy noncompliance is real and is  arguably the greatest threat to flight safety today, and the po -tential impact of improvement in compliance is significant. No   other single decision can have such an impact in the reduction  of aviation accidents as the decision to go around. The industry must improve its awareness of the problem;  to accomplish that, a shift in focus and cultural norms is  required. It is believed that significant improvement is attain -able; however, the cultural shift will be much easier if the in -dustry shifts collectively, as opposed to individual companies   taking individual action. However, several companies already  have chosen to go it alone on this issue. The project accomplished the goals of the 2011 document  that outlined the terms of Flight Safety Foundation™s Go-Around  Safety Initiative Š ﬁto understand the noncompliance by flight  crewmembers, and noncompliance of quality control measures  by flight managers,ﬂ and to consider the safety risk associ -ated with go-arounds and ensure that the transfer of risk is   understood. There are several useable guidelines in the appendix of  the report. Not all envisioned products have been completed,   however, and this is noted in the report as work yet to be done  by Flight Safety Foundation. 6 |4 Background 1  Curtis, William. IAC meeting. Boeing, Seattle. 2008. presentation In 2008, Flight Safety Foundation™s International Advisory  Committee (IAC) was briefed 1 about concerns that go- arounds often were not being conducted when an unstable  approach occurred below the stable approach height (SAH).   The ensuing discussion concluded in agreement that the issue  should be studied further. Interestingly, the Foundation™s Eu -ropean Advisory Committee (EAC) began its own discussion   related to go-arounds, the lack of unstable approach policy  compliance, the risk of the go-around maneuver itself, and  what effect air traffic services (ATS) providers could have on  the issue. These discussions led the Foundation to look more   deeply into the empirical data supporting such concerns. Failure to conduct a go-around is the number one risk factor  in approach and landing accidents (ALAs) and the number one  cause of runway excursions (Burin, 2011: The Year in Review).  Recent analyses of data from 1994 through 2010 indicate  that 33 percent of all accidents are runway excursions, and  that they are the most common type of accident (Burin, 2011:  The Year in Review) (Tarrel). Unstable approaches occur  on 3.5 to 4.0 percent of all approaches, and 95 to 97 percent   of flight crews whose airplanes are in this state continue  the approach to landing (Burin, 2011: The Year in Review)  (Klinect) (Pursey, Evidence Based Training). In ﬁAnalysis of  Approach and Landing Accidents and Serious Incidentsﬂ Š  one of several studies conducted by Flight Safety Foundation™s  Approach and Landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) Task Force  and published by the Foundation in 1999 Š the task force con -ducted an in-depth analysis of 76 accidents and incidents that   occurred from 1984 through 1997. The task force found that a   go-around was initiated in only 17 percent of the occurrences  and said that ﬁgiven the evidence – analysts expected the  initiation of a higher number of go-arounds in practiceﬂ (Flight  Safety Foundation ALAR Task Force). Approximately 65 percent of all accidents are ALAs (W.  F. Curtis) (IATA). One analysis concluded that more than 80  percent of ALAs would have been preventable Š if the crew  had decided to go around (Burin, 2011: The Year in Review).  Simply calculated, potentially about half of  all accidents could  be prevented with a decision to go around. No other single de -cision can have such an impact on the overall aviation accident   rate. Although all of these studies are somewhat subjective,  the consistencies from study to study indicate the problem is  real and is of the magnitude the studies indicate. Clearly, a go- around decision can yield great benefits, but what about the   risks associated with the go-around maneuver itself? There is no shortage of informative studies that have ana -lyzed what occurred during ALAs and what factors contrib -uted to the accidents. However, no known study has examined   flight crew decision making from a psychological perspective  to determine why some crews continued with an unstable  approach, knowingly violating company policies, and why oth -ers elected to go around. What are the drivers of intentional  noncompliance with a critical safety policy? The ALAR Task Force™s analysis of approach and landing  accidents and serious incidents identified ﬁpoor professional   judgment/airmanshipﬂ (i.e. decision making) as the most fre -quent casual factor, occurring in 74 percent of the 76 events.   Another form of poor decision making Š ﬁpress-on-itis,ﬂ or  continuing an approach when conditions suggest otherwise  Š accounted for 42 percent of all occurrences (Flight Safety  Foundation ALAR Task Force). More questions arise about the actions, or inactions, of  company management in these events. If the data have been   consistent for many years, why have managers not been able  to correct the problem? With such a low industry compliance  rate, some basic questions about management™s role need to  be answered: Are they aware of the noncompliance rates, and  if so, then why have they been unable to mitigate or improve  compliance with established go-around policies? If they are  not concerned with the poor compliance rate, why not? Man -agement issues were not cited in any of the 13 conclusions of  the ALAR Task Force™s final ﬁAnalysis of Fatal Approach and  Landing Accidents.ﬂ However, in the Task Force™s conclusions  of a related study Š ﬁAnalysis of Approach and Landing Ac -cidents and Serious Incidentsﬂ Š ﬁcompany management fail -ureﬂ was identified as a circumstantial factor in 46 percent of  the occurrences (Flight Safety Foundation ALAR Task Force). Based on these analyses, better awareness of the problem,  and new questions, Flight Safety Foundation initiated the  Go-Around Decision-Making and Execution Project (2011). It   was designed as a joint EACŒIAC project, with each committee  focusing on one specific aspect of the issue; the IAC focused  on go-around decision making, and the EAC focused on the  performance of the go-around. 7 |5 Go-Around Decision Making 5.1 Flight Crew 5.1.1 Methodology and Information Collection The Presage Group was commissioned by Flight Safety Foun -dation to conduct research and analysis on the psychology of  factors contributing to intentional noncompliance. The basis  for much of the following comes from two studies conducted  by Presage Š one that analyzed the psychology of flight crew  decision making during unstable approaches, and another that  analyzed the psychology of company management decision  making pertaining to addressing noncompliance with com -pany go-around safety policies (Smith, Jamieson and Curtis,   Why Are Go-Around Policies Ineffective? The Psycology of De -cision Making During Unstable Approaches) (Smith, Jamieson  and Curtis, Why Are Go-Around Policies Ineffective? The View  From the Airline Manager™s Desk). Although the issue extends  beyond unstable approaches, the studies were conducted on  this phase of flight as data were readily attainable from flight  crews. A psychological survey was developed that used unique  questioning and experimental methodologies to understand  the causation of compliant versus noncompliant flight crew   go-around decision making. These techniques included assess -ing pilots™ experiences using a series of questions designed   to explore the psychological precursors of risk assessment  and decision making. A second survey was designed to assess  the perceptions, beliefs and experiences of airline manag -ers and safety and operational personnel regarding unstable   approaches and how they are managed at their host compa -nies. To fully understand the systemic roots and dynamics of   noncompliance with unstable approach policies across the   industry, the results of the managers study were compared  with those of the parallel flight crew study. 5.1.2 Flight Crew Event Recall Š Study Segmentation In this segment of the study, we asked pilots to recall recent  specific instances of unstable approaches, at or below SAH  (i.e., we asked for the  last instance  they had experienced). This  special ﬁsituated recallﬂ task elicited detailed descriptions   of their experiences during the minutes leading up to and  including a decision on whether to call for a go-around. These  experiences include subjective aspects (e.g., their situational  and risk assessments, felt social pressures, fatigue, beliefs  about their companies™ go-around policies, etc.) as well as  their psychological representations of the objective factors   characterizing the aircraft and the environment during their  approaches (e.g., flight instabilities, visual reference condi -tions, environmental and air traffic control [ATC] factors, etc.).   These variables constitute a full and in-depth recounting of  the objective factors and their resulting psychological states  during the critical time interval leading up to the decisions  Š states that were hypothesized to be the highly important  precursors of those decisions. In addition, to help refine the  analysis, pilots also reported a variety of basic demographic  information (e.g., rank, time on type, base of operations,   etc.) and flight operational characteristics (long haul versus  short haul operations, aircraft type, etc.). The content of the  entire survey was thoroughly reviewed, commented upon and  amended in accordance with the recommendations made by  members of the IAC and EAC and other expert advisory team  members. The pilots were divided into groups: Ł Those who only experienced continuing to land with an  unstable approach (UA group); Ł Those who only experienced a go-around (GA group); and, Ł Those who had experienced both go-around and unstable  approach events. Pilots in this group were randomly as -signed to one of two groups Š to recall a scenario in which  they had flown an unstable approach but did not call for a  go-around, or to recall a go-around event. This random experimental assignment allowed us to confi -dently identify objective and psychological situational factors   associated with noncompliance with go-around policies re -garding go-around decision making. Pilots who reported they   had only flown a go-around or an unstable approach recently  (i.e., in the last five years) recalled their last event of those  respective types. The main set of psychological and psychosocial factors  assessed was a differentiated set of nine facets of awareness  that ﬁunpackﬂ the concept of situational awareness in a com -prehensive and holistic way, giving a rich phenomenological  account of unstable approach and landing conditions as they  are lived, and providing useful and targeted guidance for mit -igations. This set of psychosocial awareness constructs (Pres -age Group) includes the aspects detailed in Table 1 (p. 8),  which comprise an inter-related system of mutual causation.  It was hypothesized that greater awareness on each of the  nine awareness dimensions would be associated with mak -ing better assessments of risk and decisions to go around;  in general, greater situational awareness competencies  Table 1 Glossary of Presage Situational Awareness Constructs (Pilots) Construct Name DescriptionA˜ective awareness (C1) ﬁGut feeling for threatsﬂ Pilot™s gut feeling for threats; seat of the pants experience,  which is characterized by an emotional, sensory experience   that triggers further cognitive analysis Anticipatory awareness (C2) ﬁSeeing the threatsﬂ Pilot™s ability to see and/or monitor real and potential threats  as they move and change over time and space Critical awareness (C3) ﬁRelying on experienceﬂ Pilot™s ability to draw from his or her personal and professional  experience bank to assess here-and-now events as ﬁnormalﬂ Task-empirical awareness (C4) ﬁKnowing the limitsﬂ Pilot™s expert knowledge of the operational envelope of his or  her equipment Functional awareness (C5) ﬁKnowing the instruments and  equipmentﬂ Pilot™s expert knowledge of how to read and translate what   his or her instruments say Compensatory awareness (C6) ﬁAdjusting to threatsﬂ Pilot™s ability to know how and when to compensate or adjust  correctly for present and anticipated future operational   conditions in order to ensure safe and compliant operations Hierarchical awareness (C7) ﬁKnowing the proceduresﬂ Pilot™s expert knowledge of operational procedures, their  order and correct sequencing Relational awareness (C8) ﬁKeeping each other safeﬂ Pilot™s ability to accurately assess and engage crewmember  relationships in a manner that protects safety and compliance Environmental awareness (C9) ﬁCompany support for safetyﬂ Pilot™s experience of how the company supports and  encourages safety and how this in turn shapes his or her   commitment to safe and compliant behavior Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation 8 |are associated with more operationally compliant decision  making. 5.1.3 Pilot Go-Around Thresholds Š Study Segmentation A second experiment was included in this survey, and we   report some findings below, but the details are too numer -ous to fully describe here. This experiment was designed to   uncover the environmental and physical instability param -eters that influence pilots™ perceptions of the risks inherent  in flying unstable approaches, and to examine when their  attention to these parameters affects their judgments about  when to call for go-arounds. In this study, pilots were pre -sented with a hypothetical flight scenario in which they were   randomly assigned to receive variations in the severity of the   risk associated with wind conditions, runway conditions/ braking action and runway length. They were then asked at  what degree of deviation, on five different flight parameters,  those variations would cause them to call for a go-around.  Pilots were instructed to report on their likelihood of calling  for a go-around, based on their own  personal  risk criteria, not  those of their companies or of the industry, on this set of five  flight parameters, and to do so at  different altitudes. This allowed  us to infer where on the flight  path different risk factors become  personally salient and important  as drivers of pilots™ judgments to  go around, and how these factors   might interact. The objective was to  determine whether there was basic  alignment between pilots™ percep -tions about when there is a need   to call for a go-around and general  company/industry policies about  when these instabilities necessitate  such a decision. In case of evidence  of any gaps between these two,   our goal was to use these data to  guide realistic recommendations  about changes in policy that might  bring them into alignment while  ensuring that safety would not be  compromised. To the extent that  pilots do not see current policies  as constituting a set of legitimately  unsafe conditions, they are likely   to ignore such standard operat -ing procedures (SOPs) and engage   in potentially riskier, noncompli -ant flight behaviors. This was an  experimentally based attempt to explore pilot perceptions of  what  should  constitute the conditions to go around, in  their  experienced judgment, and to begin to develop a view about   whether such beliefs could be or should be incorporated into  policy guidance and SOPs in a way that would help ensure   compliant, safe behavior. 5.1.4 Pilot Respondent Sampling Respondents to this survey were solicited through direct   communication with safety personnel at various pilot asso -ciations and FSF-member and non-member airlines globally,   as well as through various social media forums. The goal was  to invite and administer the online survey to as many pilots  as possible from around the world, representing a variety  of fleets, aircraft, flight operations, respondent experience  levels, cultures, physical geographies, and so on. Anonym -ity was assured to inspire honest and complete self-reports   of pilots™ experiences, as well as to stimulate participation.   The 2,340 pilots who completed the survey included those  with a good range of pilot experience on a variety of opera -tional types, as well as wide geographical representation,  9 |Table 2 Sample Characteristics  (n=2,340)Variable Category Percent of sample Gender Male 97Female 3Continent of  operations Africa 1Asia 25Europe 28North America 34Oceania 0South America 12First language Non-English56English44Initial training Non-military 74Military 26Current position Captain 66First o˚cer 33Relief pilot 1Flight hours (career) Median ˛10,000Range 200 Œ 31,000Aircraft operation Passenger 88Charter 4All cargo 7Corporate <1Inactive <1Type of operation Short-haul 62Long-haul 38Note : Percentages for some variables do not total 100 because of rounding.

Specifically, we asked such managers  about the rates of compliance with unstable approach policies  that they believed their airlines experienced, as well as the  compliance rates experienced by the commercial industry as  a whole. Beyond this basic knowledge, we asked whether they  were satisfied with their airline™s performance on compli -ance with their unstable approachŒgo-around policies and   procedures, and whether they thought them effective, about   their perceptions of the clarity and appropriateness of these  policies and procedures, about their beliefs that they had the  support (informational support and organizational approval)  to manage their company™s go-around rates, and about their  overall assessment of how urgently they believed that the  risks (if any) perceived in their go-around rates needed to  be addressed (if at all). The content of the entire survey was  thoroughly reviewed, commented upon and amended in ac -cordance with the recommendations made by members of the  IAC, the EAC and other expert advisory team members. As in the pilot study, the main set of psychological and  psychosocial factors assessed were included in a differenti -ated set of nine facets of awareness, ﬁunpackingﬂ  situational  awareness  in a comprehensive way, giving a phenomenological  account of how effectively, from a manager™s experience, they   are managing pilot compliance with the unstable approachŒ go-around policies. This set of psychosocial awareness  constructs (The Presage Group) includes the aspects detailed   in Table 3 (p. 10), which comprise an inter-related system of  mutual causation. Table 3 describes the nine facets in a con -text associated with a managerial role. 5.2.1 Management Respondent Sampling The managerial respondents whose participation was solic -ited for this Flight Safety FoundationŒsponsored survey were   contacted via email communication/invitations from the  Foundation, International Air Transport Association (IATA)  and Airlines for America (A4A), as well as by several airlines.  Anonymity was assured to inspire honest and complete self- reports of managers™ beliefs and opinions. As was true of the pilot sample, with the managers who  completed the survey, we achieved wide geographical  representation, suggesting that our results can perhaps be   generalized to management personnel worldwide (Table 4, p.  11); however, several caveats are explained below. In fact, the  distributions Š by gender, continent and language Š in the  managers™ sample were nearly identical to those in the pilots™  sample. While few directors completed the survey, there were  a sizeable number of mid- and senior-level managers in the  sample. However, a subsequent question about respondents™  roles and responsibilities within their airlines for recom -mending and leading change in unstable approachŒgo-around  policies and procedures revealed that only 63 percent of those  in the sample had such authority. Also included were respon -dents who were responsible for quality control of day-to-day  10 |Table 3 Glossary of Presage Situational Awareness Constructs (Management) Construct Name DescriptionA˜ective awareness (C1) ﬁGut feeling for threatsﬂ Manager™s gut feeling for threats; seat of the pants experience  or ﬁspider sense,ﬂ which is characterized by an emotional,   sensory experience that triggers further cognitive analysis Anticipatory awareness (C2) ﬁSeeing the threatsﬂ Manager™s ability to see and/or monitor real and potential  threats as they move and change over time Critical awareness (C3) ﬁRelying on experienceﬂ Manager™s ability to draw from personal and professional  experience to assess here-and-now events as ﬁnormalﬂ Task-empirical awareness (C4) ﬁKnowing the limitsﬂ Manager™s expert knowledge of the operational envelope of  his or her policies and procedures; in other words, knowing  the boundaries Functional awareness (C5) ﬁKnowing the performance  metricsﬂ Manager™s expert knowledge of how to read and translate   what data about his or her policies and procedures mean Compensatory awareness (C6) ﬁAdjusting to threatsﬂ Manager™s ability to know how and when to compensate or  adjust correctly for present and anticipated future operational   conditions to ensure safe, compliant operations Hierarchical awareness (C7) ﬁKnowing the proceduresﬂ Manager™s expert knowledge of operational policies,  procedures, their order and correct sequencing Relational awareness (C8) ﬁKeeping each other safeﬂ Manager™s ability to accurately assess how his or her actions  in managing the internal policies and procedures either   facilitate and protect safety and compliance or compromise   themEnvironmental awareness (C9) ﬁCompany support for safetyﬂ Manager™s experience of how the company supports and  encourages safety compliance and how this in turn shapes  his or her commitment to safe and compliant behavior or   adherence to the operational policies and practices Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation flight operations, irrespective of whether their role included  policy development or implementation. The considerable efforts that we made in our outreach and  engagement strategy for the survey garnered 880 unique  visits to the survey portal. We consider this number of hits to  be very good, indicating that the engagement strategy drove a  meaningful number of airline managers to the site. However,  of those visiting, only 164 (18.6 percent) completed the survey,  a response rate low in both absolute terms, and relative to the  rate of participation among pilots (34 percent), who were asked   to complete a much longer and more demanding survey. This  low response rate constitutes, we believe, the first evidence  pointing toward disengagement with the topic of unstable   approachŒgo-around policy and procedures among airline  flight operations personnel at the managerial level. This is  especially true when we consider that the original criterion for  inclusion in our final analysis stipulated that respondents must  be in a position to develop and influence unstable approachŒ go-around policies and procedures at their airlines by virtue  of their authority to recommend  or make changes. Based on this  inclusion criterion and an analysis  of respondents™ self-  reported roles  and responsibilities, we achieved a  sample of only 103 qualified respon -dents. To increase the sample size   for analysis, we widened the sample  frame to include those respondents  responsible for quality control of  day-to-day flight operations at their  airlines, even if they did not have  policy development responsibilities.  (Note: A thorough comparison of the   latter group with the original target  revealed no systematic differences  in their survey responses, justifying  their inclusion in the final sample.)  The study, therefore, reports the  results from 128 managers (78 per -cent of all survey respondents and   15 percent of survey site visitors). This low response rate essen -tially disallowed us from analyzing   data for a second, experimental  task of determining personal go- around thresholds for unstable  approach risk among managers,  similar to the pilots™ go-around  threshold experiment. Meanwhile,  in light of the low response rate, a  caveat must be issued for all other  results that we report below. That is because the normative  response to the survey invitation among managers worldwide  was to choose  not  to participate; therefore, we must question  whether this was a valid and reliable sample of managers.   That said, the results, although based on this small sample,  are highly suggestive of trends in managers™ perspectives on  unstable approachŒgo-around policies and procedures. While  we are unsure if the sample is, in fact, biased, our intuition  tells us that any sample bias, if present, would tend toward   having surveyed managers who are more engaged, aware and  concerned about the issue than those who are less so. If this is  true, these results may more likely over-represent the degree  of awareness and concern about unstable approachŒgo- around noncompliance that exists in the industry. 5.3 Industry Sensing Throughout the project, there have been numerous dis -cussions with operators, regulators, manufacturers and  11 |investigative bodies, and conference and meeting presenta -tions with follow-on conversations. Off-the-record accounts  from agencies not wishing to be identified indicate that, of  those that have tracked go-around compliance, rates are in  the range of those discussed above (3 to 5 percent), and that  they have been in that range for a protracted period of time.  The exceptions are a couple of airlines that indicated their go- around compliance rates approach 100 percent. Additionally, they say that their flight data acquisition  programs are set to report out when the number of stable   approach parameter exceedances is greater than one. The  U.S. Federal Aviation Administration™s (FAA™s) Aviation Safety  Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS)/flight operational  quality assurance (FOQA) definition says an unstable ap -proach occurs when more than two parameters are exceeded  between 1,000 ft above ground level (AGL) and 500 ft AGL,  or below 500 ft (The Mitre Corporation). Most unstable   approachŒgo-around policies require a go-around when one or  more parameters are exceeded. Often, the conversation begins with go-around policy non -compliance and expands to include discussions of unstable  approaches and how they can be prevented in order to mitigate  runway excursion ALAs. 5.4 Analysis: Pilot Decision Making 5.4.1 Overview of Results The design of this study enabled us to look at the differences   between those pilots who were compliant with their compa -nies™ policies and those who were not, according to objective   and subjective measures. Table 5 (p. 12) presents data for the  demographic, flight operational and objective factors present  in the unstable approach events reported by pilots. Table 6 (p.  13) shows results for the psychological measures taken, that  is, the Presage situational awareness variables, psychosocial  factors (fatigue, risk assessment, etc.) and crew interac -tions. Table 7 (p. 14) illustrates findings for the measures  of how pilots, in hindsight, evaluated the outcomes of their  decisions and what they perceived as the main influences on  their choices (i.e., personal, interpersonal, operational and  organizational). In these three tables, pilots are divided into four different  groups for comparison: 1. Go-aroundŒonly history/GA group (27 percent of  sample): pilots who reported they had only flown one or  more go-arounds in the last five years but no unstable  approaches; 2. Mixed history/GA group (16 percent): pilots who had   flown one or more go-arounds and one or more unstable  approaches in the last five years and who were randomly  assigned to recall their last go-around event; 3. Mixed history/UA group (36 percent): pilots who had   flown one or more go-arounds and one or more unstable  approaches in the last five years and who were randomly  assigned to recall their last unstable approach event; and 4. Unstable approachŒonly history/UA group (21 percent):  pilots who reported they had only flown one or more un -stable approaches in the last five years but no go-arounds. A comparison of groups 2 and 3 (a combined 52 percent of   the total sample) within each table represents one focus of  the analysis, as these pilots were the only ones randomly  assigned to groups.

Findings from a  comparison of these groups are conservative, and represent  situationally important factors associated with go-around  decision making, not pilot dispositional factors. However, pilot  tendencies and preferences associated with flying unstable  approaches are, of course, present in the aviation community,  and we will also point out in the data how such pilot disposi -tional factors may additionally contribute to noncompliance  with go-around SOPs. It is our belief that the best way to present the findings is to  describe how pilots™ noncompliant behavior is a function of a  decision-making process influenced by the in-flight aircraft  and environmental factors that shape pilots™ decisions, their  situational awareness competencies in encoding and inter -preting the cues they receive about these aircraft and envi -ronmental factors, their personal perceptions of risk and risk   tolerance that result, and their appetite for appropriate col -laborative conversation about risk during the approach as an   input to decision making. It is from both the pilots™ responses  within each of these four classes of variables, as well as the  interactions between the two pilots, that a complete descrip -tive, psychological profile for noncompliance emerges. 5.4.2 Pilot Situational Awareness Profile Situational awareness of his or her environment, in all its   facets, is the psychological prerequisite for a pilot to judge  risk and then to make a decision to maintain compliance and  safety in light of that judgment. This study used The Pres -age Group™s Situational Awareness Model for measuring and   interpreting the psychological and social factors that col -lectively make up situational awareness. Recall that within   this model, situational awareness comprises nine distinct  but interconnected and seamless aspects of awareness. Much  of our discussion will be framed around how each of these   aspects influences a pilot™s decision-making processes, singly  and in concert with one another, to remain compliant rather  than noncompliant. (We note in passing that the Presage  model classifies with an average 85 percent accuracy whether  pilots are describing an unstable approach and landing or  a go-around Š 88 percent for unstable approaches and 82  percent for go-arounds Š based only on its psychosocial  measurements and excluding any knowledge of the objective  factors present in the unstable approach scenarios reported.   This means that our assessment of the experience of aware -ness, as we have measured it, does a good job of predicting   pilots™ decision-making behavior Š far beyond a 50 percent  chance level of prediction). The results of this study revealed, as hypothesized, that on  all nine inter-related situational awareness factors, unstable   approach pilots were significantly less aware than go-around  pilots in the moments leading up to and including their go- around decision making Š that is, they were less aware of  their emotional responses to threat, less able to anticipate  risk, more overconfident in their ability to compensate for the  instability, and in less agreement with company SOPs, etc. In  other words, the unstable approachŒrecall pilots scored much  lower than did the go-aroundŒrecall pilots on every facet of   situational awareness assessed. Seven of these nine differ -ences held up statistically to the more rigorous analysis that   compared just the experimentally assigned go-around and un -stable approach pilots with one another. And eight of the nine   differences between the experimentally assigned go-around  and unstable approach pilots were even more pronounced  when comparing the GA-only and UA-only groups. It is meaningful to ask, ﬁHow does this awareness shape  a pilot™s perception of risk?ﬂ Put simply, a pilot™s situational   awareness competencies directly affect his or her perceptions  and assessment of risk. The lower the degree of threat that  pilots associate with instability and environmental factors Š  the perception of which is directly informed by their situ -ational awareness Š the lower the significance that pilots will   place on the contributing factors and the less risky they will  perceive the situation to be. Table 6 shows this result, with  unstable approachŒrecall pilots reporting much lower assess -ments of the riskiness and unmanageability of their instabili -ties than go-aroundŒrecall pilots. 5.4.2.1  The Spreading Activation Effect of Situational Awareness  Competencies We have asserted that the inter-dependent nature of the facets  of situational awareness means that a decline in one facet will  produce a rapid deleterious effect on the others. This becomes  clear when we consider the data relevant to this ﬁspreading  activation effectﬂ of situational awareness facets. For example,  this cross-contamination effect is evident among the unstable  approach pilot groups, whose lower scores on their gut feel  for threats (Table 6), as well as on actually seeing the threats,  leave them vulnerable to minimizing both their assessment of  the potential threat of aircraft instability and their ability to   see the threat of instability as a risk to be managed correctly.  The natural outcome is that more unstable approach pilots are  unstable at SAH (Table 5). A corollary of these lower aware -ness scores is that unstable approach pilots also score lower   in their ability to leverage crew relationships to maximize  compliance and safety; Table 6 shows that unstable approach  pilots are more likely to minimize efforts to consider and/or  discuss with their crewmembers both instability factors (i.e.,  16 |flight path deviation, aircraft V REF + 20 kt, 2 sink rate and land -ing configuration) and environmental factors (i.e., turbulence,  contaminated runway and occupied runway). It is the culminating effect of the aforementioned reduced  awareness competencies that leaves the unstable approach  pilots vulnerable to adopting a mental model that minimizes  the risk of instability and reduces their attention to details.  As the results for ﬁknowing the instruments and equipmentﬂ  and ﬁknowing the proceduresﬂ indicate (i.e., functional and  hierarchical awareness, in Table 6), unstable approach pilots   are more tolerant of deviations from operational limits and  procedures and less compliant with requirements that they  perform all checklists and standard calls. Moreover, as these  pilots commit to continuing with an unstable approach, they  minimize what their professional experience could offer in  executing what the SOP states (in Table 6, note ﬁrelying on  experienceﬂ or critical awareness). In other words, when an  unstable approach pilot is not tuned into salient informa -tion from his or her experience bank, he increases the risk  profile of the operation and denies himself the opportunity to  correctly adjust or compensate for the operational threat (in  Table 6, ﬁadjusting to threatsﬂ or compensatory awareness).  The finding that unstable approach pilots more often than  go-around pilots report being unstable at SAH confirms this  missed opportunity to remain compliant (Table 5). In concert with the former pattern is the finding that  unstable approach pilots were more comfortable operating  on the margins of the safety envelope (for example, in Table   6, note the lower scores on ﬁknowing the limitsﬂ or task- empirical awareness), which translates to a greater tolerance  for risk that is seen to be manageable. (Also in Table 6, note  the assessment of the instability as risky/unmanageable.) If  a pilot is paying less attention to his situational awareness  competencies, he would likely also shut himself off from avail -able resources, such as by using interpersonal relationships to   protect operational safety and remain compliant (in Table 6,  note ﬁkeeping each other safeﬂ or relational awareness). There are a number of significant findings at the granu -lar level of this construct that tell a meaningful story. Most   notable among these is that unstable approach pilots are  relatively more likely than go-around pilots to feel crew pres -sure to land, to perceive a lack of crew support for a possible   go-around decision, to feel discomfort in being challenged and  in challenging others, and to feel inhibited about calling for a  go-around because of the authority structure in the cockpit. Also, go-around pilots are about four times more likely than  unstable approach pilots (56 percent vs. 13 percent) to report   recalling that an individual was prompting the crew to initiate  2 VREF  is reference landing speed a go-around. The evidence is clear that rather than leveraging  the crew relationships as a tool for safe decision making, crew  roles, expectations and communication had a suboptimal,  even deleterious, effect. Finally, compounding this risk profile  are the findings that unstable approach pilots score lower on  ﬁcompany support for safetyﬂ and that fewer than 50 percent  of unstable approachŒrecall pilots believed they would be  reprimanded for continuing an unstable approach to land -ing while, at the same time, maintaining that their company™s   criteria for when to execute a go-around are not realistic   (Table 6). In the end, for the unstable approach pilots, there is  less buy-in to company SOPs, and an incentive structure that  ﬁencourages,ﬂ or is at least not seen to discourage, unstable  approaches that are continued to a landing. These results describe a situation that creates internal  conflict for the unstable approach pilots, at least in hindsight,  when they express regret for their decision to continue an  unstable approach to landing (Table 7). Specifically, compared  with go-around pilots, unstable approach pilots rated their   flight outcomes less positively, believed less often that they  had made the right decision, believed much more strongly  than go-around pilots that they should not have made the  decisions they did and, finally, agreed more strongly that they  had engaged in needless risk. 5.4.2.2  Interpretation of ‚Conflicting™ Results The results appear to imply a conflicting message from the   unstable approach pilot group. On one hand, unstable ap -proach pilots regret their decisions to continue an unstable   approach and land, knowing that they have taken a risk, and  yet, at the same time, they don™t believe that the company™s  criteria for a go-around are realistic (Table 6). The latter may  be, in part, a rationalization of their noncompliant decision,  and one that they carry forward into the next such unstable  approach situation. At the moment of decision, the potential  for noncompliant behavior based on these beliefs is very pres -ent, while the chance seems remote that pilots may anticipate  post-decision regret for not calling for a go-around Š and may  have that anticipation inhibit their tendency to continue the  unstable approach. Consider the psychosocial factors affecting unstable ap -proach pilots at the time they need to make an appropriate  decision on whether to go around: They have a lowered sense  of situational awareness across most facets, which has led  them to minimize the importance of objective threats in their   assessment of risk. Further, their decision-making process re -ceives little help from protective crew norms and processes;   and there is no real disincentive to fly unstable approaches,  17 |considering the expected company response to that decision.  These are the ingredients of a recipe for the ﬁnormalization of  devianceﬂ to contaminate this component of aviation safety  culture. Essentially, this term refers to the development of a   ﬁnew normalﬂ mode of operation, which is passively support -ed, tolerated and/or approved by its stakeholders (pilots),  owners (company management), and in some cases, regula -tors. Once entrenched within a given culture, this new mode™s   power and authority can considerably influence behavior,  as evidenced in the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle  tragedies (Vaughan). Supportive evidence from the results of  this study indicates that in their acceptance of the noncom -pliant normal, unstable approach pilots have surrendered   a level of situational awareness competency that directly  impacts accurate risk assessment and full compliance with   SOPs as published. In short, new norms, roles and incentives  have come to displace some of the influence that situational  awareness should have in proximity to risk assessment and  decision making. 5.4.3 Pilot Thresholds for Going Around Another area for discussion is the second experimental part  of the survey, which asked pilots to describe their risk toler -ance thresholds for various in-flight parameters, given a set   of flight and environmental conditions. We found that braking  action (good vs. poor) had a particularly large impact on a pi -lot™s perception of the degrees of instability that warrant call -ing for a go-around. On the whole, however, pilots™ thresholds  for calling for go-around varied as a function of both height  AGL and the instability parameter they were considering as a  reason for going around. For several of these instability fac -tors, the perceived threshold occurred well below 1,000 ft AGL  (Figures 1 to 3). In particular, pilots said that they should be  on profile at roughly 800 ft AGL, and that they could compen -sate for instabilities for V REF+  and sink rate later in the decent,  at around 500 ft AGL. In another project analysis, combined data from six North  American airlines (two international jet airlines, three  regional jet airlines and one regional turboprop airline) that  are studying this problem independently show 2,035 pilot  responses to the question: ﬁWhat is the lowest altitude you  believe a safe go-around could be executed from; with vari -able conditions?ﬂ (Figure 4, p. 18; Figure 5, p. 19; Figure 6, p.   20; Presage Group). The results can be broken out into four   groupings: lateral and vertical deviations, energy manage -ment, aircraft configuration and environmental conditions.   From the data, we can see significant altitude differences  between the configuration of the aircraft and energy man -agement, and how the more challenging environmental con - ditions affect flight crews™ outlooks about when a go-around  should be performed. Also of note is the lower altitude at  which flight crews feel comfortable performing a go-around  when all conditions are normal; this is not surprising, as we  Figure 1 GA Thresholds for Flight Path Deviation 0.000.50 1.001.501,00050020050Flight path deviation(dots)Altitude (feet above ground level)LFPDVFPDNorm lateral and verticalGA = go-around; LFPD = lateral ˝ight path deviation;   VFPD = vertical ˝ight path deviation Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation Figure 2 GA Thresholds for Velocity Deviation 0.002.004.006.008.0010 .0012.0014.0016.001,000 500 200 50Speed deviation (kt) Altitude (feet above ground level) VREF  +VREF  ˜Norm V REF  ˜Norm V REF  +GA = go-around; V REF = reference landing speed Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation Figure 3 GA Thresholds for Sink Rate Deviation 0200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 Sink rate deviation (fpm) Altitude (feet above ground level) Norm sink  1,000 500 200 500 GA = go-around Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation 18 |Figure 4 Pilot Response Scores to Question: What is the lowest altitude you believe a safe go-around could be executed  from?

The inherent risks associated with the 97 percent  of unstable approaches that continue unstable can only be  indirectly inferred from the present methodology, based on  pilot self-reports. This study mainly assessed the psychologi -cal characteristics and attributes,  in situ , of pilots who choose  to continue unstable approaches to landing versus those who  make decisions to go around. The study does not segregate  the various unstable approach scenarios into classes of envi -ronments presenting high or low objective risks. While it is   understood that not all unstable approaches carry the same  level of inherent risk, the 97 percent of unstable approaches   that are flown to completion include the highest-risk ap -proaches, and these can result in accidents. In the absence   of a definition of the objective level of risk associated with  a given approach, pilots have only one set of criteria, one  definition of the instabilities and environmental threats  that are expected to trigger a go-around choice. Beyond this  single definition, it is up to the pilot to further determine  19 |Figure 5 Pilot Response Scores (Cumulative) to Question: What is the lowest altitude you believe a safe go-around could  be executed from?

Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation what he or she perceives as a safe and manageable level of  risk. This determination flows directly from his level and  type of situational awareness and the mental models of risk  he constructs based on that awareness. To the extent that a  pilot has lowered situational awareness Š whether caused  by acute aspects of the situation such as a high workload or  chronic aspects of the cultural environment such as lessened  acceptance of the company™s go-around policy guidance or  generally few challenges to cockpit command Š he will be  less sensitive to relevant situational awareness cues and   therefore be more likely to continue an unstable approach  irrespective of the inherent objective risks associated with   the approach. These inadequately informed mental models  of risk less accurately and sensitively represent the objective  levels of the present threat. As a result, they will not track re -ality and will tend to produce an over-occurrence of noncom -pliant decision making. 5.4.5 Complete Prescriptive Policies vs. Predominately  Prescriptive Policies Complete prescriptive go-around policies and SOPs lend them -selves to one set of criteria Š one definition of the instabilities  20 |Figure 6 Pilot Response Scores (Average) to Question:  What Is the Lowest Altitude You Believe A Safe   Go-Around Could Be Executed From?

A single set of criteria is often insufficient to  cover all eventualities, however. As Tony Kern, an aviator, psychologist and author of  several books on human behavior, has said, guidance is ef -fective when it is ﬁwell thought out and fair, written clearly,   explained thoroughly, commonly understood and voluntarily  complied with.ﬂ Too many rules lead to cynicism and noncompliance, and,  because not all situations can be anticipated, rules cannot be   developed to cover all possible developments; in these cases, the  human ability to adapt to changing situations is just as important  as the implementation of effective policies and procedures. ﬁWe need to reach a point where two types of professional  discipline become second-nature habits,ﬂ Kern said. ﬁThe first   is the  organizational discipline  to keep the [bad] rules to an  absolute minimum and enforce the [good] rules across the   board. The second is the  personal discipline  to comply [with  company policies].ﬂ Too often, he said, policies and procedures conflict with  cultural norms, and when that happens, ﬁanyone who studies   noncompliance knows that culture will nearly always trump  policy, at least in the long run.ﬂ (Kern) Not all unstable approaches carry the same level of inherent  risk, and based on the different objective environments from   approach to approach, there can be a conflict between these  and the singular prescriptive company go-around policy, as in -dicated by the pilots™ disagreement with company go-around   policy thresholds. Once a pilot is outside the prescriptive box  of go-around policy and has made the decision to continue the  approach, he is left to his individual risk assessment method,  whatever that may be, to determine his personal risk thresh -old, without guidance. Robust prescriptive policies that allow   for some guided, open analysis of risk and decision making  can offer a solution to these cases in which the objective envi -ronment and stated policies do not align well. For example, if a company™s go-around policy says that a  flight crew must go around in all cases if the aircraft has not   touched down within seven seconds of crossing the threshold,  the pilots likely would view the importance of that policy dif -ferently, depending on the conditions of the day. They would   likely be more in agreement with the policy for an approach   to a shorter runway that was contaminated and had a slight  tail wind than for an approach to a longer, dry runway with a  slight head wind. If the policy is written to allow some devia -tion from the seven-second requirement, under some guiding   principles, pilots will agree with the policy more often. In this  example of the short contaminated runway, the pre-descent  briefing should include a statement that there would be no  modification of the seven-second rule, whereas in the case of  the dry, long runway, the briefing may include an allowance to   increase that timeframe to 10 seconds. It is important to em -phasize that these allowances should follow a guided process   laid out by the company, and that the policies remain predomi -nately prescriptive. In this example, guiding principles may be   that all crewmembers agree in advance of the modification,  and that the landing distance available exceeds the landing  distance required by a predetermined percentage. 21 |By allowing some guided decision making, pilots will be more  likely to trust and voluntarily comply with written policies, in  part because those policies will address the highly variable  environments in which pilots work and also because the pilots  will recognize that their expertise and real-time knowledge are  being used in the risk-assessment process. An increased agree -ment on policy leads to increased buy-in and to the normalization   of compliance. 5.4.6 Stable Approach Criteria, Gates, Callouts and Decision Points It is also worth discussing the relationship between the   stable approach criteria, the SAH targets, gates, safe landing  guidelines and decision points. As the decision to go around  remains possible up until the point of thrust-reverser deploy -ment and go-around policies usually indicate that a go-around   should be initiated any time an aircraft becomes unstable  below the SAH, then it follows that the decision point to go  around defines the beginning of a zone in which a go-around  is mandatory if the approach is unstable; thrust reverser  deployment defines the end of that zone. Most SOP callouts,   however, channel flight crews to specific decision points to  determine if they are in a state in which it is safe to continue  the approach; these points are before thrust-reverser deploy -ment. These SOP callout points are usually linked with SAHs,   leaving no formal stable callouts for an extended period of  time when a go-around is viable. Active calls (a selection of  calls that are mandatory for all varying objective conditions)  force communication between pilots. Passive, or conditional  calls, on the other hand, are only communicated if stimulated   by a condition. The weakness in the passive call process is  that, if a call is not made, it could be for reasons other than  the required objective condition being present. For example,  if a crewmember did not see the condition, a call would not be  made; in addition, a crewmember might choose not to make a  call for varying reasons, such as a subjective interpretation of  the condition or fear of the cockpit authority structure. Active  calls are always made, and, as stated, they force communica -tion; their absence indicates another problem, such as pilot  incapacitation. Many responsive callouts by the pilot flying at SAH or  minimum approach height suggest what will happen, what  they are going to do Š for example ﬁLanding.ﬂ Suggestive  calls like this, to a degree, influence the decision to land and  close the window for the decision to go around, even though a  go-around may be required if the flight becomes unstable very  late in the approach or landing. Repeated and escalated calls allow a condition to remain  alive in the conscious mind of the pilot; on the other hand,   a single callout Š for example at SAH Š raises situational  awareness about the condition at that moment. As situational  awareness is dynamic, it can change quickly, improving or   worsening, and callouts that are designed to continue as long   as the condition exists help to maintain awareness of that  condition; escalation of the calls can heighten awareness. Take  the example of callouts from Enhanced Ground Proximity  Warning Systems (EGPWS) and other terrain awareness and  warning systems (TAWS). The system alerts the flight crew  to a pending condition and continues with callouts until the  condition is no longer present. The same effect can be accom -plished in unstable approach callouts by both crewmembers   and automated systems. As the onset of approach instabilities can occur at any time,  even late in the landing phase (Burin, Keys to a Safe Arrival),   the window for a go-around decision follows; that is, the deci -sion is not made at a defined point at the SAH. The decision   points for a go-around are separate and distinct from the  stable approach window, and as such, procedure designers  can separate the two to maximize go-around decision making. In reviewing the FSF ALAR Task Force ﬁRecommended  Elements of a Stabilized Approachﬂ (Flight Safety Foundation   ALAR Task Force), we discover a somewhat conflicting mes -sage. It states that approaches in instrument meteorological   conditions (IMC) must be stabilized before reaching 1,000 ft  AGL. (In visual meteorological conditions [VMC], they must  be stabilized before 500 ft AGL in precision, nonprecision and  visual approaches alike). On the other hand, the document  indicates that descent below 500 ft is acceptable in maneuver -ing for a circling approach, and specifies that ﬁwings should be   level on final when the aircraft reaches 300 ft above airport   elevation.ﬂ In other words, on a precision guided approach, the  documented guidance is that the aircraft must be stable on  final no later than 500 feet AGL in VMC, and on a circling non- guided approach, the aircraft must be stable on final no later  than 300 feet AGL. It is not difficult for a pilot to conclude that,  if it is acceptable and safe to fly off a final approach profile  until 300 ft AGL on a non-instrument approach, then it is also  safe to fly an instrument-guided approach to 300 ft off profile,  although that is, by definition, unstable. 5.4.6.1  Objective Monitoring/Feedback Objective monitoring/feedback is that which does not require   an individual to interpret information based on his or her ex -perience or opinion; it is usually factual information. Objective   feedback in the cockpit minimizes the need for interpretation  and can lead to more consistent and faster decision making.  Additionally, stating a fact Š instead of interpreting informa -tion, making a judgment or forming an opinion Š helps mini -mize the effect of a steep authority gradient in the cockpit,  such as may exist when a low-time first officer is paired with  a high-time captain. An example of objective feedback is that  22 |given by an automated system such as EGPWS. In this case,  there is little subjective analysis done by the pilot when re -sponding to automated callouts, and the response can be quick   and predictable. This is, in part, why an automated energy  management/unstable approach monitoring and alerting sys -tem can be very effective in improving go-around compliance.   Another example of the use of objective feedback is the use of  radio altimeter automatic callouts rather than interpreting  radio altimeter readout information. Readouts can fluctuate  due to terrain variances, and must be observed and evaluated.   Callouts, on the other hand, are only heard; in the absence of  an automated energy management system, after pilots cross  the threshold, they usually subjectively interpret, or sense,  how much runway has passed by, or how much remains. From  this, they decide whether to conduct a go-around. If the pilot  monitoring (PM) times the threshold crossing and then makes  a procedural call at the point where touchdown should occur  or a go-around should begin, this call constitutes objective  feedback to the pilot flying (PF) and makes clear that some -thing Š either touchdown or a go-around Š should occur (or  should have occurred, driven by policy and SOPs). Minimizing subjectivity in go-around decision-making pro -cedures is an objective that procedural designers should make  every effort to achieve. 5.5 Analysis: Management Decision Making 5.5.1 Overview of Results In Table 8, we present data for managers™ self-reports of their   awareness of, and, if possible, their specific estimates of, both  the industry™s and their own companies™ rates of compliance  with unstable approachŒgo-around policy. When asked whether they knew what the industry-wide  compliance rate was, only 32 percent of managers said that  they did. Of those who claimed awareness, however, fewer  were willing to estimate a rate. Thirty-four managers (27  percent of the 128 participating) offered an estimated rate,  which averaged 20 percent compliance (seven times the true   rate) and was highly variable (range: 1 percent to 80 percent;  standard deviation: 24 percent). Only one in seven managers  (16 percent) reported a rate that was considered ﬁaccurateﬂ  (within 10 percent of the actual 3 percent industry-wide  rate). The perception of industry-wide rates may not be the  central concern of managers working to police their own  noncompliance with unstable approachŒgo-around policy, but  this general lack of awareness and accuracy in estimating the  true rate, even among those claiming awareness, cannot be   overstated. When asked whether they knew what their own company™s  compliance rate was, 45 percent of managers said that they  did, although only 42 percent offered an estimate of that rate.  Thus, a majority of managers are largely unaware of unstable  approachŒgo-around compliance and noncompliance rates,  even within their own companies. Of the 54 managers who  offered estimates, the mean rate was 34 percent compliance,  again with a large range (0 to 100 percent) and standard de -viation (35 percent). These managers are estimating compli -ance rates at their companies that are, on average, more than  50 percent above the industry average as they perceive it (20  percent). If their estimates were accurate, they would indicate  that the managers™ companies were outperforming the indus -try as a whole by more than tenfold (34 percent vs. 3 percent).  What is most striking is the tremendous degree of variability  in the data, revealing that there is very little common basis of  perception, even among those claiming knowledge of the rates  at their own airlines. In our view, it is highly unlikely that this  is an objective estimate. For perceptions to have truly tracked  with reality, these data would mean that companies are ex -hibiting the full range of compliance from zero to 100 percent.   It is hard to imagine that this is the case, and hard to imagine   how this could result in an industry-wide average that hovers  at 3 percent year after year.

Of the 116 managers at those compa -nies, 54 (47 percent) reported on their rate of compliance  as indicated by their data. These 54 managers are not the  same 54 who reported on their companies™ flight operations  compliance rates in answer to the prior question. One in eight  managers (12 percent) reported FDAŒbased compliance rates  broadly in line with the industry average (i.e., less than 10  percent). At the opposite end of the spectrum, 21 percent re -ported rates above 50 percent. The mean rate was 44 percent,  again with a wide range and variability (zero to 100 percent,  with standard deviation of 37 percent). That such a spread of  compliance rates is reported by this sample is surprising; we  believe it reflects not only a general lack of awareness among  managers of the rates of compliance with their own policies  (as strongly indicated by the incidence of non-reporting) but  perhaps also specific errors within their knowledge, although  objective data are available. This assertion can only be made,  however, by again assuming that compliance rates exceeding   50 percent are rare in the industry; we cannot rule this out  because although we have access to self-reported data, we  lack objective verification of company compliance rates. If the  self-reported rates are accurate, it suggests that our sample is  drawn from an unusually compliant subsample of companies.  In that light, the lack of awareness effects across the manager  study suggests that industry-wide awareness could be less  than estimated. We begin with some overall observations about the data  in Table 8. First, on each of the three questions, the norma -tive response is to not know, and only a minority of manag -ers claim to know, or report, a rate of compliance. Second,   as expected, managers claim, and report, compliance rates  for their own companies more frequently than they do for  the industry as a whole, probably because they are less  familiar with   industry-wide data. Third, their perception of  the industry-wide compliance is out of line with reality, six   times greater than the actual 3 percent rate of compliance.   Fourth, managers tell us as an aggregate sample that they  believe their companies are outperforming the industry™s rate  of compliance by 50 to 100 percent, on average; this is the  equivalent of a compliance rate at least 10 times greater than  the industry™s as a whole. Finally, if we assume that these com -panies have a more realistic unstable approachŒgo-around   policy compliance rate below 10 percent (i.e., a rate span still  up to three times better than the current industry norm), this  would mean that only about one in seven managers (12 to 17   percent) in the survey reported an accurate rate for their own  companies, whether their reporting was based on a personal  estimate or on their FDA data. If we give them more ﬁcompli -ance credit,ﬂ and allow that their companies actually achieved  rates upward of 50 percent, then a high accuracy of managers™   rates of report is still shared by fewer than one-third of the  sample: Seven in 10 simply do not know their own rates, or if  they do know, they over-report their compliance rates by more  than 50 percent. These kinds of perceptual errors are likely  to produce overconfidence and complacency about mangers™  unstable approachŒgo-around policy compliance. 5.5.2 Manager Situational Awareness Profile 5.5.2.1  Manager Perceptual Measures of Situational Awareness Managers completed 17 questions to assess their attitudes,  beliefs and behaviors concerning their company™s go-around  rates and unstable approachŒgo-around policies. The results  are in Table 9 (p. 24). First, the responses were subjected to an empirical factor  analysis to determine how they merged in managers™ minds  and to provide simpler summary categories for presentation  and discussion. Three of the four factors to emerge had more  than one associated question. One factor (Factor 4) was a  single-question assessment of behavior, namely, whether the   respondent debriefed flight crew who had violated the com -pany™s unstable approachŒgo-around policy. Factor 1™s theme was the perceived support that the respon -dents received from their companies in understanding and   managing go-around rates. The six questions this factor com -prised were averaged and called ﬁperceived support.ﬂ Factor 2   comprised questions assessing the degree to which managers  thought that their companies™ unstable approachŒgo-around  policies and procedures and their associated operational   definitions were effective, clear and appropriate. Responses to  five questions were averaged to create an index of ﬁperceived  effectiveness.ﬂ Finally, Factor 3 was an expression of manag -ers™ concerns about and sense of urgency surrounding their   companies™ go-around rates. It was formulated by averaging  responses to the five questions shown in Table 9, and named  ﬁperceived threat.ﬂ In addition to the four factors, we present overall measures  recorded by managers of their satisfaction with, and the per -ceived effectiveness of, their companies™ go-around policies  and procedures, as they relate to unstable approaches.

The overall measure of perceived effectiveness was  slightly weaker than the index score of effectiveness; overall  satisfaction with compliance rates associated with their flight  operation™s go-around policies, while slightly lower, was still  on the positive side of the scale. In concert with this pattern Š  perhaps  because  of these perceptions and judgments Š man -agers slightly disagreed overall (perceived threat) that there  was a cause for concern or a need for action to improve their  go-around rates. Taken together, these absolute scores indicate that manag -ers are not completely happy with their companies™ perfor -mance on go-around policy and procedures, but their concerns   are not great enough, seemingly, to stimulate greater aware -ness or action. As an aside, a regression analysis of the drivers of the ﬁover -all effectivenessﬂ and ﬁoverall satisfactionﬂ scores revealed  that overall effectiveness is perceived in proportion to scores  on the Perceived Effectiveness Index, and to a lesser degree,  the lack of urgency and concern is expressed by scores on the  Perceived Threat Index. In complementary fashion, over -all satisfaction was driven first by lower perceived threat   scores and secondarily by higher perceptions reflected in the  Perceived Effectiveness Index. These meaningful, differential  patterns were observed, although the overall measures of   satisfaction and effectiveness were high. Finally, managers, on average, narrowly agreed that they ﬁde -brief all flight crews who have broken our company™s policies on  operational procedures for go-around.ﬂ Taken at its face, 37 per -cent disagree that all flight crews are debriefed, a high absolute   number of managers who admit to less than complete debriefing  protocols. However, while this may seem like a high percentage,  the fact that the statement was phrased as ﬁI debriefﬂ as opposed  to ﬁour company debriefsﬂ may account for the response. To examine the relationships between positive perceptions  of organizational support, compliance effectiveness, satisfac -tion and low concern with their go-around rates, we studied  responses from only those managers who had reported on  their companies™ FDA-sourced go-around compliance rates  Š that is, of all those claiming knowledge of this informa -tion. We divided them into managers whose reports were   generally close to the industry average of 3 percent, accept -ing anyone who reported a rate of less than 10 percent into a  group we labeled ﬁcorrectﬂ (for reporting what looked like a  reasonably accurate rate, compared with the industry base  rate). All other managers reported compliance rates from 10  to 100 percent and were placed in a comparison group labeled  ﬁincorrectﬂ (for reporting a compliance rate not likely to be  accurate). The results show that stating an ﬁincorrectﬂ rate of compli -ance is associated, at significant statistical levels, with higher  scores on two of the five questions on the second factor of per -ceived effectiveness, the Effectiveness Index as a whole, and   the overall, single measure of effectiveness (overall effective -ness). It is also correlated with lower scores on the Perceived   Threat Index and four of its five component questions. While  this pattern may seem obvious in hindsight, it makes the point   that, independent of the level of support perceived for manag -ing a company™s go-around rates (there were no differences on   the Perceived Support Index), the perception of the company™s  policies as effective and the threat as low may flow from a  basic lack of realistic knowledge or appraisal of the go-around  compliance rates. If this causal effect is true Š that is, posi -tive perceptions lead to low perceived threat Š then what is   clearly indicated by these data is the need for consciousness- raising about the industry norm of massive noncompliance,   and dissemination of the managers™ own companies™ data  identifying their internal rates of unstable approachŒgo- around policy compliance and noncompliance. 5.5.3 Segmentation Analysis To determine whether the sample included types of manag -ers whose views of their company™s go-around compliance  rate and performance were consistent with each other and  also different from other identified groups, we conducted a  traditional cluster analysis on this sample of managers (i.e.,  non-hierarchical, agglomerative K-means cluster analysis,  based on Euclidean distances). Due to the small sample size,  we generated just two groups to compare, and based the  mathematics of this segmentation on a variety of responses  given in the survey. This ﬁbasis of segmentationﬂ consisted of   the 17 perception questions and the two overall measures of  effectiveness and satisfaction Š all the measures presented in  Table 9. Not surprisingly, the resulting groups consisted of one  whose members perceived a high risk in their go-around  compliance rates (the ﬁHigh Risk Perceiversﬂ Group) and a  second group whose members had a more moderate view  (the ﬁLow Risk Perceiversﬂ Group). The 35 percent of manag -ers who perceived high risk differed from the 65 percent of  low-risk perceivers on almost all measures in the survey, and  powerfully so, in both the statistical sense and the magnitude  sense (the degree of statistical difference). Table 9 shows  that on 17 of 19 measures, and on all three indexes, the High  Risk Perceiver Group showed a pattern of higher concern and  perceived threat, lower satisfaction with their companies™  go-around compliance, lower perceived policy and compliance  26 |Table 10 Presage Situational Awareness Construct Results for Managers Situational Awareness Indices Overall  Sample n=128Means 1Report of FDA  Compliance Rate Segmentation 0Œ<10% ﬁCorrectﬂ n=14Means 110Œ100% ﬁIncorrectﬂ n=39Means 1High Risk  Perceivers n=44 (35%)Means 1Low Risk  Perceivers n=82 (65%)Means 1Functional Awareness Index (knowing the performance metrics) 3.324.073.42**3.723.10Hierarchical Awareness Index (knowing the procedures) 1.711.691.742.191.46Task-Empirical Awareness Index (knowing the limits) 2.162.672.15*2.901.77Critical Awareness Index (relying on experience) 2.953.963.01*3.842.41A˜ective Awareness Index (having a gut feel for threats) 3.004.063.05*4.042.38Anticipatory Awareness Index (seeing the threats) 3.084.113.14*4.192.42Compensatory Awareness Index (adjusting to threats) 3.023.453.01**3.592.71Relational Awareness Index (keeping each other safe) 2.342.542.362.902.03Environmental Awareness Index (corporate support for safety) 2.282.662.22*2.921.93FDA = ˝ight data analysis; GA = go-around; n = number; UA = unstabilized approach Notes:  1.

Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation effectiveness and lower perceived support from the organiza -tion for managing go-around rates. They also reported lower  rates of debriefing their noncompliant flight crews. When we profiled these two groups on other measures  collected in the study, we found interesting correlated ef -fects. For example, high risk perceiver types tended to see   their company compliance rates as slightly underperform -ing, relative to (perceived) industry norms, whereas low   risk perceiver types reported that their companies were  definitely outperforming the industry compliance rate. High   risk types were more likely to claim that prior to the study,  they had been aware of the industry rate and of their own  company flight operations™ rate of compliance. Interestingly,  those in the High Risk Perceiver Group were more likely to  report being in roles in which they had less power to effect  change, more often saying they were able only to offer recom -mendations. Added to the fact that members of the High Risk   Perceiver Group were three times less likely than those in  the Low Risk Perceiver Group to say their compliance rates   were between 50 and 100 percent Š a suspect number Š and  more than four times as likely to say that their FDA showed  their rate was between zero and 9 percent Š a number more  in line with industry norms Š a picture emerges of a group  whose members are more realistic and appropriately anxious  and concerned about their companies™ low rates of go-around  compliance, but who perhaps have little voice or power within  the company to change policy or procedures (which they see  as more likely to be unrealistic) or to offer a new definition of  what should constitute a stable approach (which they see as  overly narrow). How did these managers score on the Presage indices  of situational awareness? This situation presents a clear   instance of violation, via near-complete noncompliance, of  most airlines™ policies and procedures surrounding unstable  approachŒ  go-around performance rates and their manage -ment. As such, our metrics are likely to show low absolute  scores, on a scale of 1 to 6, with 6 corresponding to high safety  awareness. The first column of Table 10, which displays these  scores for the overall sample, shows this to be the case; in no  case does the absolute score on any of our awareness metrics   exceed the midscale of 3.5. Safety awareness is low in all of  the awareness areas assessed by our system. 27 |Because we know in this instance that unstable approachŒ go-around noncompliance is a major problem for the industry,  our measures of situational awareness are scored higher  when this problem is recognized to be present. In the ap -proach to scoring shown in Table 10, all measures are scored   such that higher numbers indicate a greater degree of realistic  threat awareness and appraisal. As a result, higher situational  awareness on our measures is associated with seeing the cur -rent threat to be real (high anticipatory awareness) and the   procedural measures used to compensate for it to be inad -equate (poorly adjusting to the threat). Managers with higher  situational awareness see their current procedures as unre -alistic and the definitions of instability as too narrow (high   scores on knowing the procedures and knowing the limits).  Their experience (critical awareness: high reliance on experi -ence) tells them there is a problem, and they feel more anxious   and eager to take action against this safety threat (higher gut  feeling for threats). However, because a new plan is needed  in the face of a general lack of appreciation of the threat to   compliance in their organizations, higher awareness is also  associated with a perception that their companies have little  will to change, and are generally complacent about the SOPs  in place to manage the threat (low relational and corporate  support for safety). As a result, those with higher awareness  also feel less support from Š and a higher level of discomfort  in approaching Š senior management to broach the issue. With this understanding of our scoring methods in mind,  we examined the scores of the two groups Š the managers   who reported a compliance rate based on their FDA that was  ﬁcorrectﬂ (less than 10 percent) versus those who overesti -mated the compliance rate (10 percent or more). We hypoth - esized that a more accurate awareness of the true, low rate of  compliance would be associated with a heightened sense of  awareness, perceived threat and anxiety, the felt need to com -pensate, etc. Š all aspects of the situational awareness model.   We predicted, therefore, that managers who were aware of  the actual low rate of compliance with unstable approachŒgo-  around policies at their airlines would receive higher scores  on all nine of our metrics than their colleagues who were  unaware, even if the magnitude of these scores was still low in  absolute terms when compared to the scale range. In Table 10, it can be seen that on seven of our nine metrics  of situational awareness, the hypothesis that the go-around  respondents would report greater situational awareness was  supported at a level of statistical reliability of 90 percent or  better; that is, if this experiment were repeated 20 times, we   would observe the same differences in 18 of the replications.  Only on ﬁKnowing the proceduresﬂ and ﬁKeeping each other  safeﬂ were the levels of awareness similar for the two groups,  albeit at low absolute levels. In summary, those aware of the  low compliance rates at their companies scored at or above  the midscale on five of our metrics (Functional, Critical, Affec -tive, Anticipatory and Compensatory). If a minimum midscale   threshold of situational awareness across a majority of our  measures was enough to trigger some action, the individuals  in this group were close to reaching such a trigger point. How -ever, note that this group constituted just 11 percent (14 of   128) of our sample Š a small minority coming to full aware -ness of the problem. Table 10 also shows results derived from cluster analysis  on the Presage metrics for the two groups Š those perceiving  relatively high risk in their companies™ unstable   approachŒgo- around policies and rates (35 percent of sample) and those   not generally perceiving such risks (65 percent). (It will be  recalled these groups were designed for all managers in  the sample, irrespective of whether they claimed to know,  or ventured to report, what their company compliance rate  actually was, according to FDA or otherwise). In this case, all  nine awareness factors are statistically reliably different, with   five means above the midscale for the high-threat perception  group. These results are more encouraging in terms of ﬁsiz -ingﬂ the complement of managers perhaps ready to act in this   important area of noncompliance, as about one-third of the  sample shows signs of having reached a threshold of aware -ness that will trigger activity to manage this issue more safely   in the near future. As a demonstration of the effect that improved awareness  in one area can have on overall situational awareness, we   compared the situational awareness scores of all managers  (Figure 7, p. 28) with the scores of the group whose members  were aware of their internal company go-around compliance  rates (Figure 8, p. 28). Figure 8 shows the incremental benefit  that awareness in one area can have across eight of the nine  constructs. Finally, it is relevant to discuss the industry™s approach  to monitoring unstable approach flight data. As many flight  data monitoring programs are set to report only when more   than one stable approach criterion is exceeded, and in some  programs, to report only a low level alert until three or  more criteria are exceeded, we see an indication from those  responsible for the design of these programs that there is an  acknowledged variability in the risk of unstable approaches,  and, more importantly, there is an indication of a discon -nect between the level of management™s concern for low risk   unstable approaches and the policy guidance for flight crews  on those same approaches, which is to execute a go-around   when one or more criteria are exceeded. From the perspec -tive of the flight crews, why should they be concerned about   the risk of this level of unstable approaches if management is  not concerned enough to want to be told about them or act on  28 |Figure 8 Situational Awareness of Managers  Who Knew Company Compliance Rules 123456Gut feel for threats Relying on experience Seeing the threats Knowing the limits Coporate support for safety Knowing the performance metrics Adjusting to threats Keeping each other safe Knowing the procedures Additional bene˜t Base score Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation them? This is consistent with the results of both the pilot and  management psychological studies. 5.5.4 Industry Sensing The conversation about reducing the risk of ALAs often drifts   toward how to eliminate unstable approaches, even though  the discussion begins with a focus on rates of compliance with  go-around policies. It is clear that there is a larger discom -fort with the existence of unstable approaches, despite the   fact that the industry has reduced unstable approaches to 3  percent or less. In an industry with such variable objective  environments, one must ask ﬁWhat is the lowest attainable  unstable approach rate?ﬂ It makes sense that an industry with  almost nonexistent compliance with go-around policies would   be concerned about the small number of unstable approaches  that occur. If we turn the tables and consider for a moment  an industry with a high rate of go-around policy compliance,  would there be as much concern about unstable approaches?  And is the focus on eliminating unstable approaches the right   strategy in reducing ALAs? In Flight Safety Foundation™s 16- year study of runway excursions, conducted in 2010 (Tarrel),   we see that 53 percent of the landing excursions were clas -sified as veer-offs, and of these, 66 percent followed a stable   approach that became unstable during the landing phase.  Only 37 percent of the landing excursions followed unstable  approaches. Overruns accounted for the other 47 percent of  landing excursions; 37 percent of overruns followed stable  approaches, and 63 percent followed unstable approaches.  In total, 52 percent of landing runway excursions followed  stable approaches, and an almost-equal number Š 48 per -cent Š followed unstable approaches. A separate analysis  by Boeing of runway overrun excursions from 2003 to 2010  found that 68 percent followed stable approaches. (Jenkins  and Aaron). Drawing from this, a concentrated effort to reduce  Figure 7 Overall Manager Situational Awareness Scores 123456Gut feel for threats Relying on experience Seeing the threats Knowing the limits Coporate support for safety Knowing the performance metrics Adjusting to threats Keeping each other safe Knowing the procedures Source: The Presage Group for Flight Safety Foundation 29 |the number of unstable approaches that become unstable in  the approach phase will address less than half of all landing  excursions. On the other hand, a reliable go-around decision- making operation has the potential to affect most landing ex -cursions Š those occurring after flights that become unstable   during the approach or landing phase. Clearly, a strategy to  continue improving the stable approach rate in addition to  improving the go-around compliance rate is the most com -plete strategy. The point of this discussion is to illustrate that   the industry™s tendency to focus only on eliminating unstable   approaches will not address a large portion of ALAs, and that  improving the go-around compliance rate holds the greater  risk-reduction potential. In 2009, an FSF runway safety initiative determined that a  gap existed in  ALAR Tool Kit  risk reduction tools, which did not  address the landing phase itself. The Foundation then developed  Safe Landing Guidelines  (Burin, Keys to a Safe Arrival), which are  intended to be used by aircraft operators to enhance existing  SOPs. Throughout this project, and through industry confer -ences and meetings, it was apparent that these guidelines were  not well known or commonly documented in company manuals.  These findings were not part of the data collection surveys. 5.6 Findings: Go-Around Decision Making The following are decision-making findings (DM) drawn from   analysis.  DMP  denotes decision-making pilot findings, and  DMM  denotes decision-making management findings. DMP Finding 1.  The unstable approach pilot group™s gut feeling  for threats Š the ﬁseat of the pantsﬂ experience characterized  by an emotional, sensory experience that triggers further cogni -tive analysis Š is lower than it is for the go-around pilot group. DMP Finding 2.  The unstable approach pilot group™s ability to see  and/or monitor real and potential threats as they change over   time and space is lower than that of the go-around pilot group. DMP Finding 3.  The unstable approach pilot group is more likely  than the go-around pilot group to minimize efforts to discuss   instability and environmental factors with other crewmembers,   and to shut themselves off from available resources. DMP Finding 4.  Unstable approach pilots are more tolerant than  go-around pilots of deviations from operational limits and   procedures. DMP Finding 5.  Unstable approach pilots are less compliant than  go-around pilots with performing all checklist items and accu - rately completing standard calls. DMP Finding 6.  Unstable approach pilots minimize what their pro -fessional experience, or critical awareness, could offer in terms of   executing known policies, compared with go-around pilots. DMP Finding 7.  Unstable approach pilots are more comfortable  than go-around pilots with operating on the margins of safety,   which translates into a greater tolerance of risk. DMP Finding 8.  Unstable approach pilots are more likely than  go-around pilots to feel pressure to land or perceive a lack of   support for a decision to go around. DMP Finding 9.  Unstable approach pilots are more likely than  go-around pilots to feel discomfort in being challenged or chal -lenging others.DMP Finding 10.  Unstable approach pilots are likely to feel in -hibited about calling for a go-around in situations with a strong   cockpit authority gradient. DMP Finding 11.  Go-around pilots indicated Š four times more  often than unstable approach pilots Š that another crewmem - ber was prompting the crew to initiate a go-around. DMP Finding 12.  Unstable approach pilots are less likely than  go-around pilots to feel support for safety from their companies,   and said they were less likely to be reprimanded for continuing  an unstable approach to landing and more likely to believe that  the incentive structure of their company does not discourage  unstable approaches to landing. DMP Finding 13.  Unstable approach pilots believe that their com -pany™s criteria for unstable approaches are not realistic. DMP Finding 14.  Unstable approach pilots, in hindsight, feel  regret about continuing an unstable approach more strongly  than go-around pilots regret going around, and feel less positive  about the outcomes of their decisions. DMP Finding 15.  Unstable approach pilots have a lower sense  of situational awareness across most facets, which leads them  to minimize the importance of objective threats in their risk  assessments.DMP Finding 16.  Pilot norms and processes for continuing  unstable approaches provide little foundation for compliant  go-around decision making (i.e., the ﬁnormalﬂ action is to  not go around when unstable). DMP Finding 17.  Norms, roles and incentives have displaced  some influence that good situational awareness should have in  risk assessment and decision making.DMP Finding 18.  Pilots who believe that their company™s criteria  for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe, on a whole,   that the threshold for the aircraft to be on profile and in proper  configuration is below 1,000 ft Š closer to 650 to 800 ft AGL. DMP Finding 19.  Pilots who believe that their company™s criteria  for unstable approaches are not realistic also believe, on a  whole, that they can compensate for energy management  30 |instabilities until the aircraft descends to 500 ft AGL, and under  certain conditions, below 500 ft. DMM Finding 1.  At the managerial level, there are indications of  general disengagement with the topic of go-around policy and  procedures. DMM Finding 2.  Among managers, there is a general lack  of awareness of industry-wide rates of go-around policy   compliance.DMM Finding 3.  Among managers, there is a general lack of  awareness of their own company rates of go-around policy   compliance.DMM Finding 4.  Among managers who have objective go-around  noncompliance rate data, such as flight data, understanding of   the compliance rate is likely inaccurate. DMM Finding 5.  Managers who claim to know the company go- around compliance rate are likely to overstate the compliance   rate by over 50 percent. These perceptual errors are likely to  produce overconfidence about go-around compliance. DMM Finding 6.  Managers perceive a moderate degree of effec -tiveness of their policies and procedures. DMM Finding 7.  Managers perceive less than a moderate level of  support within their company for managing go-around compli -ance rates. DMM Finding 8.  Managers slightly disagree overall that there is  concern about, or a need for, action to improve their go-around   compliance rates. DMM Finding 9.  The managers with better understanding of  go-around compliance rates for both the industry and their   own companies, the High Risk Perceiver Group, were more  realistic and concerned about their companies™ low go-around  compliance but perhaps have little voice or authority within the  company to change policy or procedures. DMM Finding 10.  Managers who scored higher on the situational  awareness measure associated with seeing the current threat  as real (anticipatory awareness) also scored lower in relative  terms on the measure used to compensate correctly for the risk  (compensatory awareness), suggesting the presence of a ﬁlearned  helplessnessﬂ with respect to effectively managing this risk. DMM Finding 11.  Managers with higher situational awareness  scores see their current procedures as being unrealistic and  definitions of instabilities as being too narrow. DMM Finding 12.  Managers with higher situational awareness  scores had the perception that their companies have little will to   change and are generally complacent about SOPs for managing  go-around compliance. DMM Finding 13.  Managers with higher awareness of their  companies™ go-around compliance rates also feel less support  from senior managers and a higher level of discomfort with ap -proaching them about the issue. DMM Finding 14.  Managers who were aware of low go-around  compliance rates in their companies scored at or above the   midscale on functional, critical, affective, anticipatory and  compensatory situational awareness metrics. This is a minority  consisting of 11 percent of respondents. DMM Finding 15.  The industry™s tendency is to lean toward the  single focus of improving the unstable approach rate as the   best way to prevent ALAs, even though empirical data indicate  otherwise.DMM Finding 16.  Safe Landing Guidelines , published by Flight  Safety Foundation to address an identified gap in the  ALAR Tool  Kit  risk reduction tools, is not well known by operators and not  documented in operations manuals. 5.7 Strategies for Corrective Action: Go-Around  Decision Making We conclude that there are three high-level categories that can  be defined in achieving an effective policy from a psychologi -cal perspective: Ł The policy should make sense operationally Š for most  environmental conditions encountered Š for the people  executing the policy (flight crews) and those managing  the policy (flight operations management), and should be  acceptable to those externally effected by the application of   the policy (air traffic controllers). Ł The policy must be managed effectively by the organiza - tion™s management personnel. This is important not only  because of the organization™s need to achieve objectives set  out by senior management but also because those execut -ing the policy (flight crews) need to see and understand  that the policy is being managed (i.e., management over -sight of the policy is apparent). Ł Awareness of the policy guidance and the risks associated  with not executing the policy must be high for both flight  crews and management. The following is a list of recommended higher-level decision- making strategies to mitigate go-around noncompliance. DM Strategy 1.  Ensure the policy makes sense operationally. a. Update the stable approach definition and SAH to  maximize their relevance to flight crews and their  manageability. 31 |b. Separate the stable approach definition and criteria from  decision-making criteria and decision-making points to  improve awareness that these are two distinct aspects of  go-around policies, and that decision making continues  beyond the approach phase. This does not imply that  they cannot meet at points throughout the approach and  landing; it is intended for the SOP and communication  designers to separate the psychological attachment of  these two aspects. DM Strategy 2.  Manage the policy effectively. a. Operators set specific compliance rate targets (key perfor -mance indicators) and establish initiatives to achieve them. b. Authorities amend industry and regulatory audit pro -grams to include standards and recommended practices  that address go-around noncompliance. DM Strategy 3.  Increase awareness. a. Increase awareness of go-around noncompliance and  risks associated with continuing to land when unstable,   and awareness of the significant impact that noncompli -ance has on ALAs, among:i. Operator management; ii. Flight crews; iii. Industry and pilot associations;iv.  Regulators; and, v. Manufacturers. b. Enhance situational awareness (psychosocial awareness)   to heighten flight crews™ awareness throughout the ap -proach (SAH and beyond), and landing through: i. Policy and procedural enhancements; and, ii. Communication improvements. c. Minimize the subjectivity of go-around decision making   for the decision maker (e.g., PF or captain, as per com -pany policy) to mitigate those components of situational  awareness that compromise the pilot™s risk assessment   and decision-making ability, for example, by installing  stable approach monitoring systems. 5.8 Recommendations: Go-Around Decision Making The following are decision-making recommendations for  corrective action to mitigate go-around noncompliance and  go-around execution risks. Each recommendation supports a  previously identified higher-level strategy. DM Recommendation 1.  Manufacturers should continue develop -ment of Š and operators should install Š stable approach and  energy management monitoring and alerting systems. DM Recommendation 2.  Operators should understand their own  respective go-around compliance rates. DM Recommendation 3.  Operators should establish internal go- around compliance rate measures, targets and goals. DM Recommendation 4.  Where necessary, flight crew associa -tions and operator management should establish a basis, and/  or process in which FDA can be used to assist in effectively  managing go-around compliance targets. DM Recommendation 5.  Operators and the industry should  re-define the stable approach criteria and SAH to better align  policies with manageable and operational safe practices. See  Appendix 10.3 for Flight Safety Foundation™s  Analysis: New  Stabilized Approach and Go-Around Guidelines, 2017  (proposed  for industry validation). Ł Avoid stable approach criteria and heights that address  very low-risk approaches. That is, avoid criteria that, if  exceeded, are not likely to result in a go-around decision, or  that, if a go-around decision is made, may transfer risk to a  higher-risk go-around maneuver Ł Distinguish between profile criteria (vertical and lateral),   energy management criteria and go-around decision point  criteria, which could have distinct and separate heights. Ł Allow for variable objective environments. Not all environ - ments create the same risk profile. High crosswinds, tail   winds and contaminated runways statistically create the  highest-risk environments. Ł The stable approach criteria, although mostly prescriptive,   should allow an element of guided riskŒassessed decision  making that is corroborated between crewmembers. DM Recommendation 6.  Operators should establish and publish  safe landing guidelines in operations manuals. (Burin, Keys to  a Safe Arrival) (Curtis and Blajev). See Appendix 10.4  Analysis:  Revised Safe Landing Guidelines, 2017  (proposed for industry  validation). DM Recommendation 7.  Operators should develop communica -tion procedures to be performed during every approach that   describes the state of stability and the intention of the decision  maker, based on company policy. Effective elements of these   communications include:Ł The state of stability is made by the crewmember not   responsible for the decision to go around (e.g., the PM or  the first officer, per company policy). This creates a shared  responsibility for activity in the decision-making process. Ł Communication procedures are active, not passive or   conditional (i.e., a call is made at the assigned point during every approach. This forces communication. 32 |Ł Communication procedures should be objective (i.e., they  should state facts about the condition. This minimizes  authority gradients within the cockpit. Ł Communication procedures should be sequential and esca - late (i.e., if the condition is not corrected to within limits, ac -tive calls continue and escalate to a defined point at which a  new directive call is mandated). For example, if an ﬁunstableﬂ  call at 500 ft AGL does not result in successful corrective  action, the ﬁunstableﬂ calls continue every 100 ft until the  condition is corrected or a critical point is reached, and then  a directive call is made (e.g., ﬁgo-aroundﬂ). This maintains  continuous situational awareness updating of the condition,   similar to ground-proximity warning system (GPWS) calls. Ł Active communication should continue well into the ap - proach and landing (e.g., up to the touchdown limit point).  This maintains continuous situational awareness. Ł Each ﬁstable conditionﬂ call should be answered with an ac -knowledgement or notice-of-intention call by the decision  maker (the PF or captain, per company policy). Ł The ﬁintentionﬂ call should not suggest the exclusion of  other possible outcomes (e.g., calling ﬁlandingﬂ at mini -mums when a go-around is an option can have the effect   of minimizing/compromising the window of calling for a  go-around. On the other hand, responding with ﬁRogerﬂ or  ﬁContinueﬂ assists in keeping decision making open.) DM Recommendation 8.  Operators should apply objective  feedback/communication procedures well into the approach   and landing phase, including in the touchdown zone. Energy  management monitoring and alerting systems will minimize the  need for crew-initiated calls. DM Recommendation 9.  Operators should create standard pre- descent briefing guidelines that include:Ł Environmental risk factors; Ł Instability factors that will result in a go-around; Ł A review of standard calls; and, Ł Decision making in the landing phase.DM Recommendation 10.  Operators should create standard pre- approach briefing guidelines that update the pre-descent brief -ing at a low-workload period just before the approach is begun. DM Recommendation 11.  Operators should understand their respec -tive managers™ and flight crews™ situational awareness levels and   psychological profiles for managing internal go-around policies. DM Recommendation 12.  Operators should provide training to  enhance psychosocial awareness and management, and how   they contribute to noncompliant decision making. DM Recommendation 13.  Operators should ensure no fault go- around policies are documented, implemented and understood   by management and flight crew. DM Recommendation 14.  Operators should ensure that un -stable approach and go-around policies are concise and unam - biguous, including follow-up procedures and expectations for  noncompliance.DM Recommendation 15.  Operators should communicate indus -try rates and internal go-around compliance rates, measures,  targets and goals of performance to flight crews and the manag -ers involved in achieving them. Operators also should commu -nicate the risk-reduction potential that improved performance  could have on the company™s overall risk profile. DM Recommendation 16.  State and industry audit programs, such  as the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), should establish  go-around compliance standards and recommended practices  for operators to manage go-around compliance. DM Recommendation 17.  State and industry safety organizations  such as those associated with the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO), the European Aviation Safety Agency, FAA,  IATA, the FAA Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) etc.,  should review these recommendations and assess inserting  them into their safety publications. DM Recommendation 18.  The aviation community should annually  track, through global aggregate flight data, go-around compliance  rates for both the approach phase and the landing phase of flight,  and communicate the findings to the industry. This role is suited  to safety organizations such as Flight Safety Foundation.  DM Recommendation 19.  The aviation community should  develop and implement an initiative that communicates the   industry™s go-around compliance rate, and the risk-reduction  potential that improved performance could have on the  industry-wide ALA rate and the overall accident rate. This is a  role suited to regulators, global associations and safety organi -zations such as Flight Safety Foundation.  DM Recommendation 20.  The aviation community should estab -lish a new information-sharing program to provide a method  for operators to share effective strategies to improve go- around compliance rates. Alternatively, the information should  be incorporated into an existing program.  DM Recommendation 21.  The industry should establish an identifi -able ﬁlabelﬂ for the threat/causal effect of the phenomenon of  noncompliance with go-around polices. As labels such as con -trolled flight into terrain (CFIT) or loss of control (LOC) make it  easier for the industry to relate, discuss, understand and manage a  phenomenon, a label for this phenomenon will do the same, and in  so doing, will help provide a foundation for essential awareness. 33 |The effective utility of each recommendation is different,  and each recommendation addresses a different finding or  strategy, as can be seen in Appendix 10.2. A holistic approach  to implementing these recommendations will have the best  overall effect. And as with any significant program change,  desired, and undesired, effects should be closely monitored  by an appropriate audit program such as FDA, line operations  safety audits, or IOSA. 34 |6 Go-Around Execution 6.1 MethodologyThe go-around accident and incident review included a non- random selection of published reports on go-arounds involv -ing transport-category aircraft between 2000 and 2012. A total of 64 go-around events were included. In some, the  safety of the go-around was central to the investigation, and in   others, the go-around occurred in the aftermath of the event  at the heart of the investigation. The majority of the events  (64 percent) involved single-aisle jets. Others involved twin  turboprops (20 percent) and twin-aisle jets (16 percent). The nature of the sample Š independently investigated events   in which an approach was followed at some point by a go- around Š meant that the sample group contained both safe and  unsafe go-arounds. Sometimes the investigations focused on  the circumstances that led to the go-around; sometimes they  focused on the go-around itself, and sometimes they focused on  both. Remarks contrasting the safe go-arounds with the risk- bearing go-arounds are, therefore, subject to the qualification  that the safe ones were just a non-random subset of many more  similar go-arounds that are routinely conducted because of   both crew decisions and ATC instructions. The context, safety aspects and overall level of risk of each  event were shown on a spreadsheet, with as many of a selec -tion of 185 ﬁtagsﬂ as were applicable attached to each one. Not   all tags were mutually exclusive, and not all reports allowed  the applicability of all of the tags to be established. The extent  to which many characteristics could be identified is, therefore,  understated. On the basis of the degree of risk posed by a go-around, each  event was assigned to one of three categories Š high risk (18   events), moderate risk (25 events) and non-risk-bearing (21  events). The non-risk-bearing events involved circumstances  Š some of which were similar to those of risk-bearing events  Š that were the main concern of the investigation. For the two risk-bearing categories, six ﬁheadlineﬂ go- around safety issues (GASIs) were defined in respect to the  initiation and execution of each go-around. Most of the 43 risk- bearing events involved a single GASI, but five events were   assigned two GASIs each. Each risk-bearing event was assigned one of three ﬁoutcome  risksﬂ Š LOC, CFIT or midair collision (MAC). The GASI definitions and their associated outcome risks  were: Ł AO1 Š Initiation of go-around ineffective (LOC); Ł AO2 Š Safe trajectory of aircraft not maintained once go-  around successfully initiated (LOC/CFIT); Ł AO3 Š Go-around not flown on required track (CFIT); Ł AT1 Š Safe traffic separation not maintained during go-  around (MAC); Ł AT2 Š Wake turbulence hazard during go-around (LOC);   and,Ł EN1 Š Significant low-level wind shear during go-around   (LOC). In the 79 percent (34) of risk-bearing go-arounds in which   the risk was attributable to the mismanagement and/or   mishandling of the go-around by pilots, failure to initiate a  go-around effectively was twice as prevalent as the failure to  aviate and navigate properly once the go-around was initially  established. In the 19 percent (8) of risk-bearing go-arounds in which  the risk was attributable to air traffic controllers, the follow -ing conditions applied: Ł One go-around followed controller failure to apply clearly   established procedures in respect to a late go-around,  which led directly to an unrecognized MAC risk resolved  by a traffic-alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS)  resolution advisory (RA). Ł Five go-arounds involved controller misjudgments in   dealing with the proximity of takeoffs to unexpected go- arounds Š a significant loss of separation in four cases  and an unrecognized wake turbulence hazard in the other.  Two events involved controllers talking to different aircraft  on the same frequency in different languages. In both   cases, pilots seeking to understand the developing situa -tion Š both before and after the go-around began Š were   deprived of valuable situational awareness. Ł Two go-arounds involved a single conflict between a pilot-  declared go-around and a controller-instructed go-around  in which a trainee controller under supervision in a non- radar environment was faced with an aircraft transition -ing to a conventional go-around, and the resulting need  to instruct the potentially conflicting aircraft, which was  on a required navigation performance (RNP) approach, to  fly an RNP go-around. The situational awareness of each  flight crew Š both on go-arounds in IMC Š of the potential  proximity of the other aircraft was compromised by lack of   procedure awareness. Decisions by pilots that were followed by poor initiation of   a go-around and that led to hull loss accidents  (accidents in  35 |which an airplane is destroyed, or damaged and not repaired,  including events in which an airplane is missing or inacces -sible) due to either LOC or CFIT were particularly likely to in -volve a crew in which either the pilot-in-command (PIC) or the  first officer was lacking in experience. For the PIC, this lack of  experience involved experience in either the aircraft type or  the role of PIC. 3 For the first officer, it involved experience in  the aircraft type or in multi-crew operations generally. 4In all events in which the experience of both pilots was fully  documented, one or both pilots were low on experience, ac -cording to the above definitions, in: Ł 80 percent of fatal/hull loss go-around accidents; Ł 73 percent of all high-risk go-arounds; Ł 64 percent of all moderate-risk go-arounds; and, Ł 60 percent of all non-risk-bearing go-arounds. Excessive confidence by the PM PIC that the PF first officer  would achieve a timely stabilization of the approach led the  PIC to delay takeover as PF. Often, by the time the PIC took the  controls, the circumstances had become more complex and the  chances of not properly initiating the go-around had increased. Conversely, excessive confidence by the PM first officer  that the PF PIC would achieve a timely stabilization led Š in  operating cultures that may not have addressed the effect of  a significant relative experience gap between the first officer  and the PIC Š to a delayed or absent go-around call and, in   some cases, to a near takeover or an on-ground takeover of  control in order to make such a call. The more-unsafe go-arounds are more likely than safer go- arounds to have been preceded by one or more of the following: Ł Significant procedural noncompliance, which was recorded   in 72 percent of high-risk events but in only 28 percent of  moderate-risk events, the same percentage as reported in   non-risk-bearing events; Ł A delay in making the decision to go around, which was re - corded in 39 percent of high-risk events but only 8 percent  of medium-risk events, an even lower proportion than for  non-risk-bearing events; and, Ł A complex situation at the time of the go-around decision,   which was recorded in 50 percent of high-risk events but  only 8 percent of medium-risk events, about the same as  for non-risk-bearing events. Significant violation of landing minimums, followed by a go- around decision, was a particular precursor of the nine fatal  3  Defined in this analysis as one or both of <500 hours on type or <500 hours in command 4  Defined in this analysis as one or both of <2,000 hours multi-crew experience or < 500 hours on type accidents during subsequently attempted go-arounds. Four -teen percent of risk-bearing go-around decisions were made   above 1,000 ft; half of these decisions were made because of  an unstable approach condition. Compared with moderate-risk go-arounds, high-risk go- arounds are more likely to: Ł Involve pilots with low levels of experience; Ł Involve a go-around decision made below decision   altitude/minimum descent altitude (DA/MDA); Ł Be flown by the PIC as PF; Ł Be at risk of LOC; Ł Follow a violation of DA/MDA; and, Ł Involve surprise that they have become necessary. High-risk go-arounds are less likely to: Ł Follow an unstabilized approach; and, Ł Involve a change of PF at initiation of or during the  go-around. Compared with moderate-risk go-arounds, non-risk-bearing   go-arounds are more likely to: Ł Follow go-around decisions that were foreseen as possibili -ties, rather than those that occurred unexpectedly; and, Ł Be made on ATC instructions. They are less likely to: Ł Take place at night; Ł Involve pilots with low levels of experience; Ł Have the first officer as PF; and, Ł Involve surprise that they have become necessary. They are just as likely to: Ł Be preceded by significant procedural noncompliance; and, Ł Involve a change of PF at the initiation of or during the  go-around. 6.2 Analysis: Go-Around Execution The go-around flight operations data analysis was performed   with the objective of examining the prevalence of a go-around  safety risk during normal, routine operations. More than  1,500 go-around events flown by jet aircraft operated by a  range of airlines from around the world were examined. The  analysis focused on the point at which the go-around began  and the way it was conducted. 36 |These go-around events were found in data detailing almost  500,000 flights. The majority of these flights (86 percent)  involved single-aisle jets; twin-aisle jets made up the remain -ing 14 percent. Data showed that 50 percent of the flight crews discon -nected the autopilot above 1,000 ft, 25 percent disconnected   the autothrottle above flare altitudes, and 14 percent discon -nected the flight director during the approach. Data showed the overall rate of go-arounds was 0.29  percent, or 1 in 340 approaches. However, it was possible to  distinguish two subgroups Š a lower go-around rate of 0.20  percent for operators that appeared more likely to subse -quently divert following a go-around and a higher rate of 0.35   percent for operators that appeared less likely to do so. The go-around rate for long-haul (twin-aisle) operations  was 0.40 percent Š higher than the overall rate. For single-aisle jets, the autopilot was engaged prior to  go-around initiation in 56 percent of the events and remained  engaged in 93 percent of these cases. For twin-aisle jets, the   autopilot was engaged prior to the go-around initiation in 69  percent of the events and remained engaged in 97 percent of  these cases. Forty percent of all go-arounds were initiated below 500  ft, 15 percent were initiated below the Category I instrument  landing system (CAT I ILS) minimum height of 200 ft, and 7  percent were initiated below 50 ft. Exceedance of the maximum permitted airspeed with flaps  extended (V FE ) was recorded in 2.4 percent of single-aisle jet  go-arounds and 3.4 percent of the twin-aisle jet go-arounds.  These V FE  exceedances correlated with: Ł Failure to reach and/or maintain the appropriate pitch   target; Ł Extended duration of go-around power settings; Ł An elapsed time of more than 10 seconds without retrac -tion of one stage of flaps (this applied in 50 percent of  cases); and,Ł Unstable approach. An overall association was identified between the height on  the approach at which a go-around was initiated and the pitch  attitude at which it was then flown Š the earlier the initiation  of the go-around, the lower the pitch attitude. The data showed a widespread prevalence of delayed flap  retraction once a go-around had been initiated, whereas in  only 3 percent of go-arounds did it take more than 30 seconds  to retract the landing gear. 6.3 Findings: Go-Around Execution A Go-Around Safety Forum Š initiated by Flight Safety   Foundation, the European Regions Airline Association (ERA)  and Eurocontrol Š took place June 18, 2013, at Eurocontrol   headquarters in Brussels. It was held in support of the Flight  Safety Foundation Go-Around Safety Initiative, to assist in early  implementation of the actions detailed in the European Action   Plan for the Prevention of Runway Excursions (EAPPRE), issued  in January 2013. The conference was attended by over 270 par -ticipants, including members of the French Bureau d™Enquêtes   et d™Analyses (BEA), who were conducting a study of airplane  state awareness during go-arounds (ASAGA). (BEA) The execution findings (Ex Findings) from the Go-Around  Safety Forum included the following: (Flight Safety Founda -tion; ERA; Eurocontrol;) Ex Finding 1.  Go-arounds occur at an average rate of one to  three per 1,000 approaches. There is a large variation of go- around rates among different aircraft operators and operational  environments. Ex Finding 2.  The go-around is a normal phase of flight, and  pilots should be encouraged to conduct one when conditions  warrant, as well as when they are instructed to do so. However,   since a go-around is the least flown normal flight phase, there  are particular safety issues associated with it. Ex Finding 3.  One in 10 go-around reports record a potentially  hazardous outcome, including exceeded aircraft performance  limits or fuel endurance. Ex Finding 4.  A go-around is a relatively rare maneuver for most  commercial pilots. On average, a short-haul pilot may conduct   a go-around once or twice a year, and a long-haul pilot may  conduct one every two to three years. Ex Finding 5.  Conducting a go-around carries a number of risks  including:Ł Ineffective initiation of a go-around, which can lead to LOC; Ł Failure to maintain control during a go-around, which can  lead to LOC, including abnormal contact with the runway,  or to CFIT; Ł Failure to fly the required track, which can lead to CFIT  or MAC; Ł Failure to maintain traffic separation, which can lead to   MAC; and, Ł Generation of wake turbulence, which may create a hazard  for another aircraft that can lead to LOC. Ex Finding 6.  The height at which a go-around is initiated during  an approach can present different challenges and risks: Ł Above the approach procedure minimum altitude; Ł At the approach procedure minimum altitude; and, Ł Below the approach minimum altitude. 37 |Ex Finding 7.  Low relevant experience of one or both pilots is  associated with difficulty in flying go-arounds. Ex Finding 8.  Go-arounds that follow a violation of approach  minimums are associated with a reduced safety margin. Ex Finding 9.  It is necessary for operators to be aware of the  extent to which go-arounds are being flown and the validated  reasons for them, as well as the extent to which the go-arounds  are flown safely. Ex Finding 10.  A just culture must prevail if problems in go- around safety are to be sufficiently understood and addressed. Ex Finding 11.  Aircraft energy states that are too high or too  low make the safe execution of go-arounds less likely, and this  situation can be exacerbated by a failure to understand how to  manage aircraft pitch attitude. Ex Finding 12.  The safety of a go-around is compromised by a de -lay in deciding to begin a go-around when the aircraft becomes  unstabilized below a mandatory stabilized approach gate (see   10.3.2, Approach Gates, p. 45). Ex Finding 13.  The decisions that precede unsafe go-arounds  are often made at points other than pre-determined procedural   decision points.Ex Finding 14.  Pilot go-around training needs to be propor -tional to the rate at which go-arounds are experienced in line   operations. Ex Finding 15.  The effectiveness of flight deck monitoring can  have a significant effect on the safe execution of go-arounds, but   such monitoring often is poor. Ex Finding 16.  Lack of an adequate understanding of automation  by pilots can affect go-around safety. Ex Finding 17.  Pilot understanding of how the pitch control  system works is not always apparent in their actions during   go-arounds. Ex Finding 18.  The potential for a traffic and/or a wake vortex  conflict during a go-around is sometimes reduced if pilots are   unaware of other traffic in the vicinity. Ex Finding 19.  Most pilots fly the potentially complex transition  to a go-around from a circle-to-land approach so infrequently   that maintaining competency will require an unrealistic amount  of recurrent training in proportion to other requirements. Ex Finding 20.  The extent of controller training in respect to go- around risk management is variable. Ex Finding 21.  Controllers sometimes issue instructions that may  prevent pilots from conducting a stabilized approach and may  thereby increase the number of go-arounds. Ex Finding 22.  Go-around procedures can be complex at a time  of high workload for pilots. The procedures are not always   published. Tactical de-confliction of go-arounds can place high  demands on controllers. Complexity is increased when there are  multiple approach procedures for the same runway, each with  its own missed approach point (MAP). Ex Finding 23.  Too much information in one controller radio  transmission (e.g., an explanation of the reason when giving an  executive instruction) can lead to pilot confusion. Late provision  of, or changes to, go-around instructions (including late changes  to a published MAP unless these clearly simplify it) increase  workload for pilots. Ex Finding 24.  Some pilots are reluctant to decline acceptance  of ATC instructions that are not compatible with aircraft per -formance, especially when issued at times when pilot work -load is already high. Issuing unpublished go-around/missed  approach tactical instructions at or after the initiation of a  go-around can place high demands on pilots. There is no direct  link between aircraft operator and ATC go-around training/ awareness. Ex Finding 25.  Current pilot go-around procedures may not  adequately address all the circumstances in which an ad hoc go-  around decision may be made, especially above 1,000 ft AGL or  after a decision to continue an approach made at DA/MDA. Ex Finding 26.  Go-around operational challenges are not ad -equately reflected in current regulatory requirements. 6.4 Strategies for Corrective Action: Go-Around Execution The Safety Forum discussed in depth the issues related to go-  around decision making, execution and training, and the air  traffic management aspects of safe go-arounds. Forum par -ticipants agreed on a series of conclusions in respect to eight  safety improvement strategies. Three of these strategies were  execution strategies (Ex Strategies) related to the safe execution  of go-arounds: Ex Strategy 1.  Ensure that go-around training and awareness ap -propriately reflect different go-around execution risk scenarios. Note: Independent CAST analysis determined similar find -ings and recommendations, which are outlined in CAST Safety  Enhancement (SE) 198. Ex Strategy 2.  Review go-around policy, procedures and documen -tation to maximize their effectiveness, clarity and understanding. Ex Strategy 3.  Ensure that low relevant experience of one or both  crewmembers does not prejudice the effectiveness of monitor -ing during approach, landing and go-around. 38 |6.5 Recommendations: Go-Around Execution The following principal recommendations for safe go-around  execution (Ex Recommendations) are based on Safety Forum  conclusions: Ex Recommendation 1.  Aircraft operators and ATC should im -prove their mutual understanding of each other™s go-around   practices/procedures. Ex Recommendation 2.  Industry partners should develop go- around training aids. Ex Recommendation 3.  Effective monitoring depends on ensuring  that pilots with low relevant experience are able to contribute   to safe go-around decision making and execution. Ex Recommendation 4.  Pilots and their employers should under -stand that one of the many reasons that violating approach   minimums is unacceptable is because evidence indicates that  if a go-around then becomes necessary, the chances of a safe   transition to the go-around are reduced. Ex Recommendation 5.  Pilots must be able to demonstrate that  they are able to safely execute go-arounds that begin from both  high energy and low energy states at the point where a go- around decision is indicated. Ex Recommendation 6.  Pilots must be able to exercise tactical  judgment, as well as procedural compliance, when deciding  to go around below a stabilized approach gate so that safe  execution is not hindered by an inappropriate delay in decision  making. Validation of this must be achieved through realistic  training scenarios. Ex Recommendation 7.  Go-around training for pilots should  include a range of operational scenarios, including go-arounds  from positions other than DA/MDA and the designated sta -bilized approach gate. Scenarios should involve realistic  simulation of surprise, typical landing weights and full-power  go-arounds. Ex Recommendation 8.  Go-around training for both pilots and  controllers should incorporate lessons learned from operational  events/incidents. Ex Recommendation 9.  Clear guidance should be provided to  pilots on how to act in respect to the three stages of monitoring   during approach, landing and go-around: noticing, alerting and  taking control. Members of augmented crews who are observing  should have a clear understanding of the nature of their contri -bution to effective monitoring. Ex Recommendation 10.  If an aircraft has the capability to fly  automatic go-arounds, pilot training should be provided and   the operator™s automation policy should address the go-around  procedure. Ex Recommendation 11.  Pilots must have a clear understanding  of how the pitch control system works on the aircraft type that  they fly. This should be validated by both theoretical testing and  use of suitable full flight simulator exercises involving approach  and go-around with full, rather than reduced, power/thrust  available and at typical landing weights. Ex Recommendation 12.  A review should be conducted to deter -mine whether pilots can lose situational awareness of poten -tially conflicting traffic during go-arounds if other pilots are  exchanging radio transmissions with ATC in languages other  than English. Ex Recommendation 13.  A high priority should be accorded to  the provision of RNP approach and missed approach proce - dures when current procedures involve circle-to-land and  when active radar surveillance of the transition to a go-around  is not available. Consideration should be given to withdrawing  circle-to-land procedures at airports where neither option is  available. Ex Recommendation 14.  Air navigation service providers (ANSPs)  should review and, if necessary, enhance the provision of go-  around risk awareness training for controllers. Ex Recommendation 15.  Ensure that the importance of facilitat -ing a stabilized approach and the correct application of final   approach procedures is included in training and in briefings for  ATC staff (EAPPRE Recommendation 3.3.1). Implementation Advice: Ł Training should include: a. Appropriate speed control instructions; b. Timely descent instructions; c. The importance of avoiding a late change of runway or  change in the type of approach; d. The importance of assigning a landing runway with no   significant tail wind component;e. The need to avoid vectoring too tightly onto final ap -proach and intercepting glide path from above; and, f. The importance of providing the crew with correct  information about distance to touchdown. Ex Recommendation 16.  The agency responsible for instrument  approach procedure design should ensure that straightforward  go-around procedures are available and published for each  runway. These go-around procedures should be designed in  consultation with pilots who are representative of those who  will be expected to use them. 39 |Implementation Advice: a. The principles, which underlie the MAP for each run -way, should, as much as possible, be the same. b. A low (e.g., below 2,000 ft) first stop altitude and an  early turn in a missed approach procedure should be  avoided; c. Conditional go-around procedures/missed approach   procedures (e.g., ﬁafter xxx but not later than yyyﬂ)  should be avoided. d. The (ideally common) missed approach fix should be  located close to the airport to ensure that an aircraft  in trouble can be landed immediately on any runway  with any track-distance chosen by the pilot. e. Procedural de-confliction of the missed approach   path from other traffic and from the risk of exposure  to wake turbulence, especially from late go-arounds,  should be provided. f. If both RNP and conventional missed approach proce -dures are published, then an explicit risk assessment   of such availability should be performed. a. Environmental restrictions Š especially noise-  abatement restrictions Š must not affect the design of  missed approach procedures if their imposition would  compromise safety standards. Ex Recommendation 17.  On final approach, pilots should be  advised of any significant changes in weather and/or runway  surface conditions. Contingency arrangements/procedures  should exist for use in wind shear conditions. Implementation Advice: b. Pilots should receive more relevant and quicker up -dates of weather-related information about develop -ments such as changes in visibility, wind and runway  status (e.g., quantity of water on the runway). c. Improved information should be provided to crews  about tail winds, wind shear and significant wind variation, including reports from preceding aircraft. d. Runway information should include items such as   braking action reports; information about the pres -ence of standing water, debris and wildlife, including   birds; reports of technical problems on the ground;  and reports of laser interference. Ex Recommendation 18.  Guidance should be developed for  controllers regarding the content and timing of go-around  instructions.Implementation Advice: a. Controllers should consider whether a go-around   instruction should be delivered in a separate transmis -sion from one that explains the instruction. b. Controllers must always use the standard MAP if there  is no imperative reason for an adaptation. c. If a non-standard missed approach procedure is to be   followed, controllers should detail it when issuing the  approach clearance. d. Controllers should avoid last-minute changes or in -structions except in emergency situations. e. Once a pilot has declared a go-around or is otherwise  known to have begun one, controllers should avoid  unnecessary transmissions. f. Pilot should inform ATC as soon as possible if devia -tions from the published go-around procedure become  necessary. Ex Recommendation 19.  ANSPs should consider the feasibility of  establishing a formal interface between pilots and controllers to  explore operational issues and reach an understanding. Implementation Advice: a. Pilots can be invited to attend controllers™ training  sessions, and controllers may be able to arrange to  observe pilots™ training sessions. b. ﬁOpenﬂ days can be provided for pilots to observe   operations at ATC facilities, and it may be possible to  organize familiarization flights for controllers. c. Pilots and controllers should participate in joint crew   resource management training. d. In establishing such interfaces, be aware that it is  most unlikely that the pilots participating in such an  initiative will be representative of those using the ATC  services involved and any such bias must be explicitly  recognized. Ex Recommendation 20.  Aircraft manufacturers should ensure that  go-around procedures presented in aircraft pilot training and  aircraft operating manuals are applicable to go-arounds that are  begun at any stage on final approach, up to and including land -ings that are rejected after touchdown. Ex Recommendation 21.  Safety regulators should review current  mandatory go-around training requirements for both pilots and  controllers and should ensure that the conclusions of this report  are appropriately addressed. 40 |7 Flight Safety Foundation Future Work 1. Establish a go-around noncompliance industry label such  as GANC (go-around noncompliance) or FGA (failure to go  around). This is to establish easy recognition, as has been  accomplished with other labels, such as LOC or CFIT. 2. Analyze and report, at a global aggregate level, unstable   approaches and unstable landings to determine the level of  associated risk. 3. Report global go-around compliance performance annually. 4. Develop go-around execution and training guidelines for   operators. 5. Establish industry go-around noncompliance audit standards  and recommended practices with organizations such as the  International Civil Aviation Organization and IATA. 6. In order to minimize the exposure to unnecessary go-arounds   while ensuring safety, further analysis is required to deter -mine the risk balance point between an unstable approach   and a go-around. The Foundation should ensure industry  partners pursue this analysis. 7. Promote the distribution and presentation of this report in  industry, and encourage republication in complementing  publications and safety initiatives. 8 Project Conclusion The problem of go-around policy noncompliance is real and   is arguably the largest threat to flight safety today. The  potential impact of improvement in compliance is signifi -cant. No other single decision can have such an impact in the   reduction of aviation accidents as the decision to go around. The first and foremost change required is that the industry  must improve its awareness of the problem; to achieve this, a  shift in focus and cultural norms is required. It is believed that  significant improvement is attainable; however, the cultural  shift will be much easier if the industry shifts collectively, as   opposed to individual companies making changes on their own.  Having said this, several companies are already attacking this   issue internally. The project accomplished the goals set forth in the 2011  document announcing the FSF Go-Around Safety Initiative: ﬁto  understand the noncompliance by flight crewmembers, and  noncompliance of quality control measures by flight managers,ﬂ  and to consider the safety risk associated with go-arounds and  ensure that the transfer of risk is understood . There are several  useable guidelines in the appendix of this report; however, not   all envisioned products are completed, and this is noted in the   report as future work to be done by Flight Safety Foundation. 41 |9 Works Cited Honeywell International. ﬁProduct Description SmartRunway/ SmartLanding Functions of the Enhanced Ground Proximity  Warning System.ﬂ Redmond, Washington, U.S.: Honeywell, May  22, 2009.Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB).

Ł Specific types of approaches are stabilized if they fulfill the following: Ł CAT I ILS: within 1-dot deviation of glide path and localizer; Ł RNAV: within ½-scale deflection of vertical and lateral scales and within RNP requirements; Ł LOC/VOR: within 1-dot lateral deviation; and, Ł Visual: within 2.75 and 3.25 degrees of visual approach path indicators, and lined up with the runway cen -terline no later than 300 ft. Con˝guration: Ł Aircraft is in the landing configuration (gear and flaps set, speed brakes retracted). Energy: Ł Airspeed is stabilized within V REF +10 kt to V REF (without wind adjustments). Ł Thrust is stabilized to maintain the target approach airspeed. Ł Sink rate is no greater than 1,000 fpm. General: Ł The stabilized approach gates should be observed, and active communication calls made during each approach. Ł Normal bracketing corrections in maintaining stabilized conditions occasionally involve momentary overshoots   made necessary by atmospheric conditions; such overshoots are acceptable. Frequent or sustained overshoots   are not. Ł Unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions requiring a deviation from the above elements require a   special briefing.

Continuing past the related gate should only occur if meeting the objective of the next gate is achievable; otherwise, go  around.  Example: If the ˝ight is not con˙gured by 1,000 ft, it could continue if being fully stable by 500 ft is achievable. 2. If the call at the respective gate indicates an undesired state (e.g., ﬁNot con˙guredﬂ, or ﬁFlapsﬂ), that call should be repeated   at an appropriate interval until the condition is corrected. Example: ﬁFlapsﬂ; ﬁFlapsﬂ repeated every 50 ft. 45 |10.3.1 Stabilized Approach and Go-Around Decision Guidelines  (2017) Design Rationale The following is the rationale behind Flight Safety Founda -tion™s guidelines for conducting stabilized approaches and  achieving reliable go-around decision making. Why the  change? The current FSF guidelines were established in  November 2000 and updated in 2010. Analysis revealed that  facets of that guidance are not optimal for effective deci -sion making and that they may encourage go-arounds for   approaches involving very low risk. The overall goal is to  improve go-around decision making; in revising the stabilized  approach guidelines, four objectives must be met: Ł The guidelines must make operational sense for both flight  crews and management Š resulting in greater acceptance  of the policy. Ł Safety must be ensured during the approach by mitigating   against the common types of ALAs Š  ŁCFIT;  ŁLow energy (landing short, hard landing, tail strike); and,  ŁLanding runway excursions (overruns, veer-offs). Ł It must be ensured that the resulting go-arounds are con - ducted for approaches of appropriate risk, and not those of  very low risk in which a transfer of risk to a go-around ma -neuver increases overall risk and unnecessarily increases  demands on ATC. Ł The flight crew™s collective situational awareness must be   improved through better communication. Flight crews indicated in the Foundation™s project research   that current guidelines on when a go-around must be executed  are not realistic for most real-world operational environments  and approaches. They described what realistic parameters  look like from their perspective. The criteria for which a stable approach is defined can be  grouped into three types of parameters: flight path profile  (vertical and lateral), configuration (flaps, gear and speed  brakes) and energy management (rate of descent, speed and   thrust). Add to these the variable environmental conditions  (runway length and condition, and weather), and there are  four groups of parameters to be considered when designing  stable approach criteria. 10.3.2 Approach Gates We can address all stable approach parameters and ALA  safety issues at three procedural gates: Ł 1,000-ft AGL configuration gate (variable from 800 ft to   1,500 ft, depending on aircraft type); Ł 500-ft AGL stable gate; and, Ł 300-ft AGL go-around gate. The stable approach criteria are the same at each gate for ap -proaches conducted in both IMC and VMC. 10.3.2.1  1,000 Ft AGL Configuration Gate Previous guidance required that a go-around  must  be con -ducted if the flight was not fully stable in IMC. With respect to  the physics of a go-around, safety is the same in both IMC and  VMC; in this context, differentiation of a go-around at 1,000  feet in IMC and at 500 feet in VMC is not required. The new functional significance of the 1,000-ft mark is that  it is the last suitable point along the approach to ensure that  final landing configuration is selected and verified by the  flight crew. The flap and gear transition, deceleration to final  approach speed and thrust stabilization should occur before   the aircraft reaches the next gate at 500 ft AGL. It should be  emphasized that initial configuration  should  occur before  reaching the 1,000-ft gate; this gate is the last point at which   final landing configuration should be selected and confirmed. The 1,000-ft gate is a familiar demarcation to flight crews  and is often accompanied by an automatically generated  1,000-ft callout. Note that the 1,000-ft gate may vary for air -craft type and gross weight. The operator should determine   the appropriate height of the gate, based on aircraft decelera -tion characteristics and the manufacturer™s recommenda -tions. The following discussion of aircraft energy management   during approach is based on the FSF  ALAR Briefing Notes  (Flight Safety Foundation, 2010). Aircraft Deceleration Characteristics Although deceleration characteristics largely depend on the  aircraft type and gross weight, the following typical values   can be considered for quick assessment and management of   aircraft deceleration capability. Deceleration on a three-degree glide path, with landing flaps  and gear down: 10 to 20 kt per nm. Note: A three-degree glide path is typically equivalent to a descent   gradient of 300-ft-per-nm or a 700-fpm vertical speed, for a   final approach groundspeed of 140 kt. Example:An aircraft with a final approach speed of 140 kt would need   to be at a maximum speed of 165 kt at the 1,000-ft gate to be   stable at 500 ft. Using the median deceleration rate of 15 kt per   nm and descent rate of 700 fpm: 15 kt-per-nm x (500 (ft)/300 (ft/nm) = 1.67) nm = 25 kt. 46 |This gate does not address any particular ALA type but  serves to facilitate achieving a fully stabilized approach at the  next lower gate (500 ft). Additionally, it is in line with pilot  thinking, as seen in experimental data from the project, that  aircraft configuration and aircraft energy management are  two separate and distinct aspects of a stabilized approach,  and the aircraft energy stabilization height can be lower than  the aircraft configuration height. Although a go-around may be  considered  at this gate, not  mandating a go-around at this point reduces the overall   number of potential go-arounds by allowing low-risk unstable  approaches to continue at a safe altitude. (This analysis is  discussed in 10.3.2.3.) Improved collective situational awareness at this gate is  achieved through procedural active communication between  flight crew. 10.3.2.2  500-Ft AGL Gate Previous guidance required that a go-around  must  be conduct -ed if the flight was not fully stable in VMC. The revised guid -ance retains the recommendation that the approach should  be fully stable at this gate; however, the mandate to go around  has been removed. Although a go-around may be considered at this gate, not  mandating a go-around reduces the overall number of potential  go-arounds by allowing low-risk unstable approaches to con -tinue while at a safe altitude. (This analysis is found in 10.3.2.3). Not mandating a go-around at this gate also aligns with  pilot thinking as seen in experimental data from the project  findings, indicating a go-around can still be executed safely,  even from lower altitudes when conditions are stable or have  only minor deviations outside the stable approach definition.  As this makes operational sense to those who execute and  manage the policy, there is a better likelihood of compliance. The 500-ft gate is a suitable point in the approach for flight  crew to verify all stable approach criteria. It is a familiar demar -cation for flight crews and is also often accompanied by an au -tomatically generated 500-ft callout. Being stable at this point   in the approach allows for subsequent developing instabilities  to be compared against a state of constant energy reduction. Improved collective situational awareness at this gate is  also achieved through procedural active communication  between flight crew. 10.3.2.3  300 Ft AGL Go-Around Gate This 300-ft gate is new. Establishing this gate clearly marks  the boundary between higher altitudes where a stable  approach is strongly recommended and the point where  continuing an unstable descent reduces the margin of safety.  It differentiates between approach stability and a go-around  decision. These are two distinct flight issues, and from a psy -chological perspective, they should remain distinct elements   in decision making. It should be understood that the 300-ft AGL value is not  intended to be absolute; it can be approximated to take ad -vantage of aircraft automatic callout systems. For example,   consider an ILS minimum set for 200 ft AGL. Some manufac -turer automatic callout systems provide an alert 80 ft above   minimums, so in such cases, 280 ft AGL could be established as  the go-around gate value and utilized in the auto callout in the   active call procedures. Descending in an unstable state below the 300-ft gate should  be a warning to flight crews that the level of risk is increasing  and action is required, whether the aircraft is unstable at this  gate or becomes unstable below 300 ft. Analyses indicate that  flight crews who continue an unstable descent below 300 ft do  not recognize the need for increased concern Š or the need for  a go-around. The awareness of the increased need for action  can be improved by heightening the definition of the aircraft™s   condition, from being in an  unstable condition  to being in a  condition to go around.  This can prompt the flight crew to make   the correct decision Š to go around. Martin Smith of The Pres -age Group explains, ﬁThe psychological tipping point (this is the   moment of maximum situational awareness) is when the flight  crew is primed to pull the trigger on the go-around. The subtle  change to a ‚condition to go around™ is such a primer. In other  words, the ‚condition to go around™ is permission to act, permis -sion to comply.ﬂ Drawing a comparison to another industry  initiative, the pilot not flying (PNF) is now known as the PM Š  a change that was intended to influence the mindset of the PM  and also to alter his behavior in recognition of the importance  of monitoring. A similar effect can be realized in identifying an  unstable flight condition below 300 ft as a  go-around condition  Š a condition that demands a go-around decision. To further emphasize the point, the 1,000-ft to 300-ft win -dow can be viewed as the  stable approach zone , with the focus  on ensuring that the aircraft is fully stabilized. The area from   300 ft to thrust-reverserŒdeployment can be viewed as the  primary go-around zone, where the focus shifts from stabiliz -ing the aircraft to going around. Using a rejected takeoff below   V1 (the maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must  take the first action to stop the airplane within the accelerate-  stop distance) as an analogy, a rejected takeoff below 100 kt is  considered to occur in a different regime (low speed) compared  with a rejected takeoff above 100 kt, a high-speed regime. Here,  through training and guidance, there is a shift in psychology  for pilots operating in the low-speed vs. high-speed regime. A  similar shift can be realized through the approach to landing. Lowering the go-around execution altitude reduces the  overall number of potential go-arounds by allowing low-risk  47 |unstable approaches to continue while at higher, safer, alti -tudes. It makes the stable approach and go-around policies  more in line with flight crews™ psychological beliefs and more  manageable by management, prevents risk transfer from low- risk unstable approaches to potentially higher-risk go-arounds,  and limits unnecessary demands on the air traffic system. If not fully stable at or below this 300-ft gate, the decision  to go around should be made without hesitation. A go-around  below 300 ft is not necessarily unsafe; this determination  depends on the degree and type of approach instability, and   aircraft type and performance characteristics. This gate is  essentially the beginning of the primary go-around zone from  300 ft to thrust reverser deployment. At this gate, the low-energyŒtype ALA is addressed.  The most common types of low energy ALAs are landing  short, hard landing and tail strike. If we analyze the most   extreme case of low energy, it is one where thrust is at flight  idle, speed is V REF , and the descent rate is 1,500 fpm Š double  a normal rate of descent. U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) Part 25.119 says, ﬁIn  the landing configuration, the steady gradient climb may not be   less than 3.2 percent, with the engines at the power or thrust  that is available eight seconds after initialization of move -ment of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight   idle to go-around power settingﬂ (FAA), and, ﬁThe design and  construction of the engine must enable an increase – from the  fixed minimum flight idle power from not more than 15 percent   of rated takeoff power or thrust available to 95 percent in not  less than five secondsﬂ (FAA). The most limiting of these two  regulations is the eight-second requirement. In our extreme  low-energy case of descending at 1,500 fpm, using a linear anal -ysis without taking into consideration a lessening of the rate of   descent as engines spool, and achieving a 3.2 climb gradient, the  flight will descend 200 ft (FARs 25.119, Figure 1): 1500 (fpm)/60 (sec per min) x 8 (sec) = 200 ft Another useful analysis comes from Flight Safety Foundation™s   ALAR Tool Kit , which says that an aircraft being flown on a  go-around while on a 3-degree approach path, with thrust at  flight idle, descending at 700 fpm and with V REF  at minus 5 kt,  will experience an altitude loss of approximately 40 ft (Flight  Safety Foundation, 2010). If we more than double the rate of  descent to 1,500 fpm, in this analysis, the aircraft would ex -perience an altitude loss of approximately 100 feet (FSF  ALAR   Tool Kit,  Figure 1). It is also interesting to look at design specifications for TAWS  such as EGPWS. The technical standard order (TSO) for such  systems requires that, for the final approach segment descent, a  warning be given in time to allow for a 100-ft obstacle clear -ance altitude after recovery that includes a one-second pilot  response time and 0.25 g (0.25 standard gravitational accelera -tion) pull-up (Department of Transportation, FAA, 2012). The TSO further describes the altitude loss of an aircraft de -scending at 1,500 fpm, with a response time of one second and   0.25 g pull-up as being 64 ft, and says the required warning  should be given no later than 164 ft above the obstacle (TAWS  TSO, Figure 1). In comparison with these analyses, a gate of 300 ft AGL to  execute a go-around provides adequate altitude margin for   even the most extreme low-energy unstable approach. The  margin in this case results in a 50 percent increase over the  linear eight-second Part 25.119 determination, a 200 percent  increase over the FSF ALAR determination and a 370 percent  increase over the TAWS determination. Although the number of approach and landing accidents  is greater than the number of go-around accidents, the go- around phase of flight has more fatalities per accident. By   ensuring a safe altitude of 300 ft to conduct a go-around in the  extreme unstable low-energy case, and by allowing low-risk  unstable approaches to continue between 1,000 ft and 300 ft,  the potential number of go-arounds would be reduced, lower -ing the exposure to go-arounds risks. 10.3.2.4  Comparisons of Revised Gates to Industry Monitoring and  Alerting Systems, and FAA Runway Overrun Prevention  References The project identified significant decision-making benefits in  reducing the subjectivity of the decision-making analysis by  flight crew. The most impactful way to minimize subjectivity  is to employ automated systems similar in concept to EGPWS  Figure 1 Go-Around Altitude Loss Analysis Unstable condition: Speed V REF, Thrust Idle, Vertical Rate 1,500 fpm 050100150 200 250 300 350 400Altitude loss from 300 ft above ground levelFARs Part 25.119FSF ALAR AnalysisTAWS TSOALAR = FSF Approach and Landing Accident Reduction; FARs = U.S. Federal  Aviation Regulations; TAWS = terrain awareness and warning system;   TSO = technical standard order; V REF = reference landing speed Source: Flight Safety Foundation 48 |and TCAS to help flight crews make timely and consistent  decisions. The industry has developed a few systems Š in the  form of stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting  systems Š for approach and landing energy management. The Airbus Runway Overrun Protection System (ROPS)  has a number of alerting and monitoring functions, but those  that are pertinent to this analysis are the visual alert that  begins at 400 ft AGL and the aural alert at 200 ft AGL. ROPS  does a present-time evaluation of aircraft real energy and the  runway distance available for landing, and provides a visual   ﬁRunway Too Shortﬂ alert at 400 ft and an aural alert at 200 ft  (Armaund Jacob, 2009) (Airbus, 2013). Because of the lower  altitudes at which these alerts occur, and considering the  severity of the condition Š that is, not enough runway to stop  the aircraft Š a go-around really is the only option, except in  the most dire emergencies. When comparing this condition to  the conditions being applied to the proposed ﬁNew Stabilized  Approach and Go-Around Guidelinesﬂ (p. 44), the FSF guide -lines are quite conservative. Honeywell SmartLanding System also has many alerting  and monitoring functions, including aural alerts beginning  at 450 ft AGL and ending at 300 ft AGL with an ﬁUnstable,  Unstableﬂ alert. The criteria used by the system to make the  alert are variable but based on monitoring excessive approach  angle, excessive speed and flap settings ( Honeywell Interna -tional, 2009). Again, the altitudes where these alerts are given   are similar to those recommended in the ﬁNew Stabilized Ap -proach and Go-Around Guidelines.ﬂ 10.3.3 Achieving Collective Situational Awareness Through   Active Communication This project found that situational awareness is lacking among  most flight crews who continue an unstable descent and land  unstable. Communication is vital in achieving high-functioning  situational awareness. Two key types of communication are  recommended for improvements Š approach and landing  brief -ings,  and  active communication  SOPs throughout the approach. 10.3.3.1  Pre-Descent Approach and Landing Briefings, and   Pre-Approach Briefings Most airlines already have procedures for briefings, which ad -dress the most important aspects of the approach and landing;  detailed guidance is provided in FSF  ALAR Briefing Note  1.6.  (Flight Safety Foundation ALAR Task Force, 1998Œ1999). The  following guidance is not intended to replace those briefings  but is an addition to current standard briefing guidance: Ł Improve overall ALA awareness (statistics); and, Ł Improve awareness of specific approach and landing risks. As demonstrated in the project data, simply knowing a few  overall statistics can raise situational awareness signifi -cantly. When company statistics are available, they should be   referenced; however, in their absence, the following industry  statistics can be used: Ł ALAs make up approximately 65 percent of all accidents; Ł Approximately 3 percent of unstable approaches result in a   go-around; and, Ł More than 50 percent of runway excursions follow a stable   approach that becomes unstable after threshold crossing. Additionally, reviewing the effects of runway contamination   and tail winds on runway excursions is relevant because they   contribute to a significant number of runway excursions. The  Flight Safety FoundationŒled Runway Safety Initiative found  that about 53 percent of runway landing excursions are veer- offs; of that percentage, 66 percent follow stable approaches.  Of all veer-offs, 40 percent were associated with wind, and 39  percent, with runway contamination. The remaining 47 per -cent of runway landing excursions are overruns, and of that   group, 63 percent follow unstable approaches (Flight Safety  Foundation, 2010). This project found that awareness of instabilities is criti -cally important in the landing phase as well as in the approach   phase. Some simple rules of thumb regarding the effect of  poor landing technique on landing distance can significantly  improve situational awareness. For example, pilots should plan for landing distances to in -crease by (FAA, 2007): Ł 250 ft per second of floating;Ł 300 ft per 10 kt excess speed from V REF on a dry runway; Ł 500 ft per 10 kt excess speed from V REF on a wet runway;  and,Ł 200 ft per 10 ft excess above 50 ft over runway threshold.   This also applies when the vertical guidance for the ap -proach, by design, places the aircraft higher than 50 ft AGL  when crossing the threshold. Landing distances are based   on a 50-ft threshold crossing. Briefings including these statistics and rules of thumb should   occur at intervals that will ensure that flight crews have an in- depth awareness of the information, for example bi-monthly. Briefings also should discuss any allowances for flight  crews to adjust company policies (see discussion in 10.4, ﬁRe -vised Safe Landing Guidelines, 2017,ﬂ p. 51) as permitted by   guided procedures in the policies themselves Š for example,  allowing a crew to conduct a touchdown beyond the normal  49 |Pre-Descent Approach and Landing, and Pre-Approach, Briefing Guidance, 2017 A pre-descent briefing should include, in addition to existing approach briefing components, an emphasis on  approach and landing threats. When available, company statistics should be used. Periodically (e.g. bi-monthly) the briefing should include approach and landing accident (ALA) statistics; Ł Overall statistics: Ł ALAs make up approximately 65 percent of all accidents; Ł Approximately 50 percent of runway excursions develop from approaches that become unstable after  threshold crossing; and, Ł Approximately 3 percent of unstable approaches or unstable landings result in a go-around. Ł Runway excursion environmental contributors: Ł 53 percent of landing excursions are veer-offs, with wind a factor in 40 percent and runway contami - nation a factor in 39 percent. About 66 percent of veer-offs follow stable approaches; and, Ł 47 percent of landing excursions are overruns; of these, 63 percent follow unstable approaches. Ł Landing distance increase rules of thumb: Ł 250 ft per second of floating; Ł 300 ft per 10 kt excess speed from V REF (reference landing speed) on a dry runway; Ł 500 ft per 10 kt excess speed from V REF on a wet runway; and, Ł 200 ft per 10 ft excess above 50 ft over runway threshold. For each approach ,the briefing should include: Ł Environmental ALA threats Š contamination, crosswinds, tail winds; go-around readiness. In addition to a   normal go-around briefing, heightened readiness should be discussed in the event of poor environmental   conditions; and, Ł Any adjustments to approach and landing policy requirements, as permitted by written policy guidance   (e.g., landing beyond the normal touchdown zone if performance permits). Pre-approach briefing: Ł At an appropriate low-workload period, just prior to commencing the approach, crews should recap current   environmental threats, go-around readiness and any adjustments to go-around policy procedures. Source: Flight Safety Foundation touchdown zone as long as adequate landing performance  and distance references exist. Finally, as pre-descent briefings often occur 30 minutes or  more before an approach, the project findings and recommenda -tions suggest that a short update, or refreshment of the current   threats and go-around readiness, be briefed just prior to the ap -proach during a low-workload period in the lower descent. This   can refresh and ﬁtop upﬂ flight crews™ situational awareness. 10.3.4 Pre-Descent Approach and Landing, and Pre-Approach,  Briefing Guidance10.3.4.1  Active Communication Throughout the Approach This project determined that communication is one of the key  attributes of effective collaborative decision making by flight  crews. By a factor of approximately four, flight crews who  comply with their company™s go-around policy had communi -cated about approach instabilities, and for most crews who con -tinued an unstable approach and landing,  no one  made the actual  decision to continue; that is, there was no communication about  the decision to continue, it just happened. The difficulty with   passive/conditional calls (those which are made only if a prob -lem condition exists Š e.g., ﬁairspeedﬂ) is that in their absence, it  is undetermined if the condition exists. The call could be absent  for several reasons, as explained in the report findings. Active  calls, however, force flight crews to speak, discuss or express a  condition Š either positive or negative Š on every approach. It is also important not to overload the flight crew with  standard communication and to ensure that they have time to   listen to ATC and perform other tasks; therefore, active calls  must be short and direct. 50 |Active calls are usually initiated by the PM and responded  to by the PF. The PM™s call on the approach normally indicates  a condition, and the response by the PF may either be an ac -knowledgment or a directional response. It is recommended that there be an active call at each ap -proach gate. If the active call indicates an undesired aircraft state, the  call should continue to be made periodically throughout the   approach at intervals such as each 50 ft or 100 ft, until the  desired state is achieved or a go-around is conducted. This   serves the same purpose as a warning from EGPWS or TCAS. Active, repetitive calls in the 1,000- to 300-ft zone also pre -pare the PF for an eventual conclusion if the offending condi -tion is not corrected; that is, a go-around. Repetitive warning   calls prime the PF™s anticipatory, compensatory, hierarchi -cal and relational awarenesses, as compared with common   current procedures in which a sudden, single ﬁUnstable Go  Aroundﬂ call is made at 1,000 or 500 ft, which has a lesser ef -fect in primarily the hierarchical awareness.  The implementation of active calls should not imply that  passive/conditional and communicative calls such as ﬁglide -slopeﬂ or ﬁspeedﬂ be omitted. Passive calls remain an important  component of situational awareness and should be used in  combination/coordination with active calls , as required. The following are examples of active calls at approach gates  during an approach: If an airline has a stable approach and monitoring system  installed, such as ROPS or SmartLanding, the need for a  complete series of active calls throughout the approach and  landing is largely removed. These systems apply passive/  conditional calls; however, the nature of the automation  provides a form of reliability that passive calls from flight  crews do not.

Source: Flight Safety Foundation 10.4.1 FSF Safe Landing Guidelines (2017) Design Rationale The following is the rationale behind the revised Flight Safety  Foundation guidelines for safe landing and achieving reliable  go-around decision making during the landing phase. As with  the stable approach and go-around decision guidelines, there  were several objectives, namely that the guidelines must: Ł Make operational sense for both flight crews and manage -ment to improve agreement with the policy; Ł Ensure safety during landing by mitigating the common types  of ALAs: landing runway excursions (overruns and veer-offs); Ł Ensure the resultant go-arounds are in situations of ap -propriate risk, and not those of very low risk in which a   transfer of risk to a go-around maneuver increases overall  risk, and unnecessarily increases demands on ATC; and, Ł Improve the flight crew™s collective situational awareness. The guidelines established here do not replace manufacturer   limitations and procedural guidance, or state regulations and  guidance. Excursions that occur following an unstable approach are  mitigated largely in the approach phase; however, they can still  52 |be prevented in the landing phase. Additionally, large numbers  of excursions occur following a stable approach that becomes  unstable only after the aircraft passes the runway thresh -old. Guidelines in this section are targeted at these types of  excursions. Landing excursions are of two types: overruns, in which  aircraft run off the end of the runway surface and veer-offs, in  which aircraft exit the side of the runway surface. To address  these types of ALAs, we will enhance landing guidelines in  four areas: Ł Longitudinal limit awareness (runway touchdown zone and   distance);Ł Lateral limit awareness (runway centerline); Ł Environmental variability and adjustments to established  policies; and,Ł Situational awareness and communication. Project findings include that collective situational awareness  is low during the landing phase. And although most opera -tors have policies defining where the touchdown should occur,   very few have guidance or SOPs on how to determine where  the touchdown occurs, or how and when to determine if a go- around should be executed. For example, most operators spec -ify that the aircraft should touch down in the touchdown zone   (TDZ), on the centerline; however, they do not train or specify  how to determine if the aircraft has passed the TDZ, who should  make the determination, or how much of a deviation from the   runway centerline is permissible before a go-around should be  conducted. Most pilots say either a gut feeling or experience  helps them judge when an aircraft has passed the acceptable  limit, even though they readily state that their experience does  not include go-arounds from the landing phase. The impact of improving collective situational awareness in  the landing phase can be significant. 10.4.2 Longitudinal Limit Awareness (Runway TDZ and Distance) Touchdown zones vary in length with one determining factor   being total runway length. Runways of 7,990 ft and longer  have touchdown zones 3,000 ft long (FAA), and runways of  2,400 m and longer have touchdown zones 900 m long (ICAO).  Relative positioning markings are present within the TDZ  and are clearly identifiable on a non-contaminated runway.  The aiming point is the widest marking located at the 1,000-ft  distance from the threshold (FAA), and 400-m distance from  the threshold (ICAO), with the end of the TDZ being identified  by the last marking at 3,000 ft (FAA) and 900 m (ICAO). Approach alerting and monitoring systems such as Smart -Landing provide aural alerts when an aircraft has passed a  company-defined touchdown area. When an aircraft passes   this area without touching down, an aural alert such as ﬁDeep   Landing, Deep Landingﬂ is given ( Honeywell International,  2009). SOPs then dictate a go-around. This objective warning  immediately enhances crew awareness and leads to better  decision making. In the absence of such a system, the PM,  through SOPs, can be directed to monitor the passing of TDZ  markings and make an active call such as ﬁTLﬂ [touchdown  limit], ﬁdeep landingﬂ or ﬁend of zoneﬂ after passing the last  marking indicating the passage of the TDZ. In cases in which the runway is contaminated and markings  are not visible, a couple of options exist. If available, runway-  remaining markers can be used, or, using the landing distance  ﬁRules of Thumb,ﬂ™ pilots can calculate that, for an aircraft  traveling 250 ft per second, the normal touchdown area of  1,000 to 2,000 ft will occur in four to eight seconds Š 250 fps  x 4Œ8 seconds = 1,000 to 2,000 ft. Calculations also will show that the end of the 3,000-ft-long  TDZ will pass in approximately 12 seconds Š 3,000 ft/250 fps  = 12 seconds. 10.4.3 Lateral Limit Awareness (Runway Centerline) Most operators specify that the touchdown shall occur on   the runway centerline, but do not say how this will hap -pen or who will determine when the aircraft is drifting. As   important as it is to have situational awareness regarding  a longitudinal limit, it is equally important to understand  lateral limits. Manufacturers often provide cockpit visual cues and  techniques for determining where the main landing gear is in  relation to the aircraft centerline. As an example, Boeing says that, for the 787, the view  through ﬁthe lower outboard corner of the pilot™s forward win -dow to the ground is a good visual reference for the outboard  side of the main landing gear wheels on the same side. The  lower inboard corner of the pilot™s forward window is also a  good reference for the opposite side main gear wheelsﬂ (The  Boeing Company, 2013). In the absence of other lateral limits, maintaining the most  outboard main landing gears on either side of the centerline  (straddling) is a reasonable limit. Using visual cues, as in the   example above, can help determine the positioning of the main  landing gear. This is considered a rough operational guide -line with its own limitations; however, there are no known   alternatives other than relying on ﬁgut sense.ﬂ The monitor -ing of this positioning can be performed by the PM during the   landing, and if he or she sees that the position of the aircraft is  incorrect, he can make an appropriate call Š ﬁDrift Limit.ﬂ In  that case, SOPs would dictate a go-around. 53 |10.4.4 Environmental Variability and Adjustments to   Established Policies Environmental variability can have a significant effect on land -ing performance and desired touchdown points. Operators  should consider giving flight crews the tools and guidelines to  determine when it makes sense to modify or adjust landing and  go-around policies for safety, and possibly operational efficiency.  It can be difficult for some operators to consider allowing a  crew to land beyond the TDZ; however, landing performance,  combined with sound guidance and policies for operating  outside normal definitions, makes sense when safe operations  are assured. ﬁBeyond over-proceduralization, we also have the   problem of rules with no room to apply judgment,ﬂ Kern said  in a 2009 book. ﬁMany of these policies begin with good intent.  But inside the good intent, we create systems that defy logic and  poison the well of fairness, which often results in an unintended  consequence Š loss of faith in the system of rulesﬂ (Kern, 2009). Problems can develop when environmental conditions are  such that operating outside established policies makes sense,  but there are no guiding principles on how to accomplish this.  For example, an aircraft landing on a 12,000-ft (3.7-km) run -way requires a 3,500-ft (1-km) landing distance. Although the  company policy states that a go-around should be initiated if  touchdown does not occur inside the TDZ, is it the best course   of action as opposed to an option of extending the touchdown  point to 4,000 ft (1.2 km), for example? Certainly, the answer   is yes, if the 4,000-ft mark is not definable. However, if the  flight crew can identify this point and if they have briefed the  revision to the policy, is it still the best course of action to  go around? In this case, the transfer of risk to a go-around is  questionable. A revised touchdown point can be determined  by citing a known distance point along the runway (e.g., taxi -way marking, runway distance marker or time period Š one   second approximates 250 ft (76 m) in distance). In another case in which weather and runway conditions  demand that touchdown occur before the end of the TDZ, guid -ance should give crews the methods and means to identify the  shorter touchdown limit. For example, if the crew wants to be  touching down within 2,000 ft (610 m) of the runway thresh -old, they need references to determine where this will occur,  using TDZ markings or time lapse (in seconds) from the time  the aircraft crosses the threshold. In any case, written policies and guidance must be in place  to give the flight crew permission, procedures and techniques   to modify a landing point limit. This should be briefed and  agreed upon by all crew.

In the  case of exceeding a centerline touchdown limit, it is difficult  to define a point in the TDZ where a positive centerline active  call can be made. Although not ideal, in this case, the use of  a passive/conditional call may be more operational; that is,  the call is made only when the drift limit is reached. Note that  stable approach and landing monitoring and alerting systems  accomplish the objectives of some active calls; therefore, flight  crew calls would not be required. 10.5 FSF Recommended Elements of a Stabilized Approach  (2000) [for reference] Recommended Elements of a Stabilized Approach All flights must be stabilized by 1,000 ft above airport elevation  in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and by 500 ft  above airport elevation in visual meteorological conditions (VMC).   An approach is stabilized when all of the following criteria are met: 1. The aircraft is on the correct flight path; 2. Only small changes in heading/pitch are required to main - tain the correct flight path; 3. The aircraft speed is not more than V REF + 20 kt indicated  airspeed and not less than V REF;4. The aircraft is in the correct landing configuration; 5. Sink rate is no greater than 1,000 fpm; if an approach re -quires a sink rate greater than 1,000 fpm, a special briefing   should be conducted; 6. Power setting is appropriate for the aircraft configuration   and is not below the minimum power for approach as   defined by the aircraft operating manual; 7. All briefings and checklists have been conducted; 8. Specific types of approaches are stabilized if they also fulfill   the following: instrument landing system (ILS) approaches   must be flown within one dot of the glideslope and   localizer; a Category II or Category III ILS approach must be   flown within the expanded localizer band; during a circling   approach, wings should be level on final when the aircraft   reaches 300 ft above airport elevation; and, 9. Unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions   requiring a deviation from the above elements of a stabi - lized approach require a special briefing. An approach that becomes unstabilized below 1,000 ft above   airport elevation in IMC or below 500 ft above airport elevation   in VMC requires an immediate go-around.

The customer stated   that the ramp at his airport is being repaved   and grounding points are not being re-  installed.    In recent years, there has been a change in   philosophy and practice with regard to   grounding. In the 1990 edition of the U.S.   National Fire Protection Association Standard   for Aircraft Fuel Servicing (NFPA 407), the   requirements for Ground ing were deleted and  requirements for Bonding were clarified.   The practice in the United States has been   to bond and ground, but tests have proven that   if the aircraft and fuel truck are properly   bonded, a grounding wire carries no electrical   charge at all. This is why NFPA 407 no longer   specifies grounding for safety during aircraft   fueling.  The NFPA determination was based on the   following points:  Ł Grounding does not prevent sparking at the   fuel surface  Ł Grounding is not required per NFPA 77,   Recommended Practice on Static Electricity   Ł Static electrical grounding points can have   high resistance, making them unsuitable for   grounding  Ł The wire/cable used for grounding might not   be capable of conducting current in the event   of an electrical fault in the ground support   equipment connected to the aircraft and could   become an ignition source if the wire fuses.     The Gulfstream Ground Handling and   Servicing Handbooks, and Aircraft   Maintenance Manuals have removed the   grounding requirement and call only for   bonding the fuel source to the aircraft during   any type of fueling or defueling operation.

We appreciate the input from our users  (Customers, Engineering, Tech Ops, and Field Service  Representatives) and their efforts for contributing  change requests during 2008. Anytime missing inform ation or incorrect information is identified, we  encourage you to notify us. This may be accomplis hed via a Field Service Report (FSR) or directly  through the Publications Change Request (PCR) system . Publications has taken an aggressive approach  to achieving our goals by increasing the number of  annual revisions to three for in-production aircraft  and two for out-of-production aircraft, for a total of 27 Maintenance Manual suites to be revised this year.  Technical Publications has also  launched a feasibility study for an  on-hands validation approach with  the help of the Service Facility. We are embedding te chnical writers on a non-interference basis to work  with technicians on the floor to better understand  their requirements and to allow them to give  immediate input when a publication change is required.   PlaneViewŽ Cert Delta Engineering released data  was included in 2008 revisions and enhanced the  accuracy of the G350/G450 and G500/G550 Maintena nce Manuals and Fault Isolation Manuals. The  Fault Isolation Manuals were further enhanced by intr oducing many of the observed faults that are not  electronically detected. We also enhanced the HyperNav  functionality that allows the technician to locate  components, connectors, splices, ground studs, and terminal junction physical locations on the aircraft.  In addition to maintaining this aggressive revisi on schedule, we are also  starting to develop the  Maintenance Manual Suite for the G650. Some of the te chnical writers have already been co-located with  the development engineers to begin writing the ma intenance procedures for the new Rolls-Royce BR725  engine.

AstraŽ/SPXŽ/G100®/G150®/G200® (ATA 27): Rudder Trim Actuator  Installation By Greg Miller, Director, Product Support GDAS    Rudder Trim installations on the Astra through G 200 aircraft are susceptible to water ingress into  the trim actuator housings. This has resulted in failure  either as a result of corrosion and/or freezing in  flight.    Each of the aircraft series has Aircraft Ma intenance Manual (AMM) instructions for the  removal/installation of the various Rudder Trim Compon ents. Included in the instruction is a callout for  the application of shrinkable tube, P/N ATUM-19/6-0,  at the Flexible Shaft-to-Rudder Trim Actuator  connections. These areas are highlighted below for th e respective aircraft Rudder Trim Actuators. There  is an additional callout for the G150 and G200 for blac k RTV (GE RTV-103) to be used as indicated in the  below illustrations.                                                               Flexible Shaft Upper End Sealing ASTRA/SPX/G100 Flexible Shaft Lower End  Sealing, ASTRA/SPX/G100 Flexible Shaft Upper End Sealing G150/G200 Flexible Shaft Upper End Sealing G150/G200 BREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    5 The shrinkable tubing, part number ATUM-19/6-0,  called out in each of the installations is a  specialized Raychem product. ATUM tubing is radiation-cross linked, heat-shrinkable, and adhesive-lined to provide environmental sealing in a wide variety of  applications. The internal adhesive coating, when  heated, melts and flows to form a  positive environmental seal. The co ating adheres to the outer tubing  and the surface below, creating an excellent barrier to moisture penetration.    ATUM-19/6-0 has a 3:1 shrink ratio. ATUM is the se ries of tubing, the 19/6 is the expansion-to-shrink  ratio in millimeters, and the -0 is the color identifier for black.   Ensuring this procedure is properly accomplis hed will reduce the probability of premature failure.    G150® (ATA 24/49): APU Generator Grounding By Gary Schoonover, Service Engineering, Electrical/Avionics      Several G150 aircraft have reported  ﬁGEN LOAD UNBALANCEﬂ  status messages. In some  cases, the aircraft starts out with all generator   currents reading the same and the APU generator   current slowly decreases to zero.   A team from Dallas troubleshot the problem to   a poor ground for the APU generator return cable   at 10GND (see graphic). The plate to which the   ground is mounted was found  to be poorly bonded  to the aircraft structure. When the plate was   tapped, the APU generator current indication in   the cockpit would jump.    To correct the issue, technicians removed the   rivets, burnished the two mating surfaces, and   reinstalled the plate. Electr ical bonding practices in this area have been reviewed with production   personnel to ensure proper ground performance on   future aircraft.    If you have been experiencing load sharing issues  that have not responded  to previous maintenance  efforts, please consider this pote ntial solution. This condition is under evaluation by Gulfstream, and a  Service Bulletin is under consideration. Any futu re fleet actions will be communicated via normal  channels.     G200® (ATA 33): Operating Entry Light Switch Panel on Battery Power  By John Deputy, G150/G200 Model Manager     An issue surrounding the operational characterist ics of the Entry Light Switch Panel (CMS1 Cabin  System) has been brought to our attention by a G200 aircraft operator.    With the aircraft powered down and the battery ci rcuit breaker closed, depressing one of the entry  light switches causes the controller (P/N 2052-1-6) to  power up on aircraft batte ry power, initiate a 10- minute countdown timer and turn on the associated  light within the aircraft. The deviation between the  electrical drawing note and actual op eration comes about as a result of the length of time that the switch  is depressed.      The entry light switches are momentary switches that complete the circuit as long as the switch is   depressed. A momentary tap (  1 second) on one of the entry light switches completes the circuit long  enough for the controller to recognize the request to  power up in battery mode.  However, by the time the  Operating System (OS) and application software are  both running, the active low signal through that  entry light switch is no longer present, resultin g in a case where the 10-minute countdown timer and  10GND LOCATION  BREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    6associated light are unable to turn on, as both  of these functions are controlled from within the  application software.   Troubleshooting revealed that if the initial switch  press lasts for three to four seconds, there is  sufficient time for the controller to complete the boot -up cycle such that the OS and application software  are up and running. Once the application software  is running, the switch input can be recognized,  enabling the 10-minute countdown timer and determinin g which light switch was depressed to close the  appropriate contact that turns the light on. Altern atively, if the controller is powered up with the  momentary press on the entry light switch and is fo llowed up with a second pr ess a couple of seconds  later (now that the application software is running ), the 10-minute countdown timer is initiated and the  corresponding light is turned on.   The resulting action of a single momentary tap of  an Entry Light switch is the controller would be  powered up on the battery without the 10-minute count down timer being initiated that would eventually  turn it off.     GII®/GIII® (ATA 80): Both Engines Rotate with Left Start Initiation  By Bob Landers, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group     An operator contacted Gulfstream Customer Support , requesting assistance with an engine starting  problem on his aircraft. During left engine start,  when the start button was  depressed, both engines  began rotating. When he started the right-hand engine  first, the start sequence was normal; he then did  a left-hand engine start, with no problems reported.  Troubleshooting found there was 18 volts at the righ t engine starter solenoid connector with the left  selected for start and the start bu tton depressed. Next, the wire was removed from terminal 4 on the  start selector switch, finding 0 volts on the termin al, but there was 20 volts on the wire. The wire was  then removed from TJ6P terminal H,  and no voltage was indicated on the terminal, but there was voltage  on the wire.    The connector was disconnected from the Rotation  Amplifier with voltage going to zero. Removing the  cannon plug from the Rotation Amplifier, technician s determined there was an internal failure of the  unit. The Engine Rotation Amplifier, part num ber 26530335-01, was removed an d replaced, returning operation to normal.      GIV®/G300®/G400® (ATA 27): Control Wheel Oscillation from Horizontal Stabilizer By Denny George, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group     Recently, a GIV crew reported a control wheel osc illation related to the horizontal stabilizer. The  operator made a visit to a maintenance facility to ha ve the crew™s squawk investigated: Evaluate aircraft  for tail vibration, which occurs at 0.80 Mach or gr eater. Autopilot coupled  FGC 1 or 2, no aircraft  porpoising, occurs straight and level. Vibration stops with any pitch change.  The following was accomplished during subsequent maintenance:    Ł The elevators were removed, inspected, and balanced.     Ł Both elevator number four hinge bearin gs were replaced due to excessive wear  Ł Elevator curtains and attaching hardware we re inspected for defects; none were found.   Ł An elevator free-play check was completed with no defects.     Ł Elevator trim servo and cable tensio n was checked and found within limits.   Ł The primary elevator control cable rigging and c able tension were found to be within limitations.   Ł Numerous access panels relating to the horizo ntal stabilizer and elevators were removed and the  exposed areas inspected for defects. No defects were found.   Ł Horizontal stabilizer free play was checked from si de to side and the ﬁrub  blocksﬂ were found to be  within limits at all stabilizer settings.  BREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    7 Ł The elevator actuator was removed and re placed, and the removed unit was sent out for  evaluation.  An aircraft evaluation flight confirmed the orig inal squawk, with a few more comments: ﬁThe stab  appears to be loose. The horizontal stabilizer indicato r needle was moving in concert with elevator inputs,  with up elevator applied, stab needle would move up  and with down elevator input, stab needle would  move down.ﬂ   After reviewing all maintenance actions and co nsulting with Technical Operations and Service  Engineering personnel, it was dete rmined to investigate the horizontal stabilizer actuator. The unit was  removed, inspected, and found  to be defective. The stabilizer actuat or input shaft could be turned 6 to 10  revolutions in either direction before any actuator  movement was detected. There was also approximately  0.250 to 0.375 inches axial play when applying pre ssure in the extend and retract direction of the  actuator. These two conditions are what allowed th e oscillation to stop with pitch change and the  stabilizer indicator needle to move in concert with the elevators.    The horizontal stabilizer actuator was replaced, all  associated operational chec ks were completed, an  evaluation flight was made with no defects noted, an d the aircraft was returned to service. The defective  actuator was sent out for evaluation and failure analysis.   Gulfstream and Moog are investigating this di screpancy, and any future fleet action will be  communicated via normal channels.

G350®/G450®/G500®/G550® (ATA 38): Leaking Lavatory Soap Dispensers By Denny George, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group       Several operators have commented  about soap leaking out of their  aircraft™s forward and aft lavatory  soap dispensers, Adams Rite Ae rospace Soap Dispenser Assembly  part number AR9116-DXXX. This  generally occurs only on high-altitude, long-range flights.    All incidents were narrowed down  to servicing of the soap dispenser. The filling instructions in the  Adams Rite Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) stat e: Fill the bottle with soap through housing. Do  not overfill.    The bottle capacity is listed at 5 oz. In the fault is olation section of the CMM, one of the remedies for  a bottle that does not dispense soap is to fill bottle  to capacity. However, when filled in this manner, the  bottle will leak soap due to pressurization at high al titude. The manual is not clear in exactly how much  soap should be used and indicates ﬁfullﬂ and ﬁfill to capacityﬂ as the reference marks to go by.  Based on service experience, it is recommended to  fill the soap bottles no more than three quarters  full, or 3.5 to 4.0 oz. This will prevent soap from oozin g from the assembly on long, high-altitude flights.  When serviced in this manner, no problems have b een noted. This informatio n will be added to the next  revision of the Completion Cent er Maintenance Handbook (CCMH).

As a result, we are pu blishing this reminder of the importance of using  the correct adapter when jacking the aircraft.    The latest style jack pad adapter was installed  by Aircraft Service Change (ASC) 155 for aircraft 501- 619 and is a production standard from aircraft 620  and subsequent. This modification removes the  existing MLG axle bushings, P/N 1159LM50156-1, and inst alls a Foreign Object Debris (FOD) cap at each  MLG axle jack point, which helps to minimize th e possibility of corrosion in the lower MLG axle.  Additionally, this modification changes the jack  pad adapter assembly  to a new part number,  1159GSE50214-3.

Weekly Tip: Scheduling Interface for Posting Times to CMP.net Maintenance   CMP.net has an interface with both CTA/FOS and  PFM scheduling programs that allows the posting  of aircraft hours/cycles directly into CMP.net witho ut opening the program. When the user is posting  time in either one of the above mentioned applic ations, the new interface automatically performs a  ﬁJournal Updateﬂ within CMP.net re cording Hours/Cycles and APU time. The interface will also place  any items coming due on the scheduling calendar, based  upon the projected utilization of the aircraft for  CTA/FOS users. Best of all, this service is free!  Since a Web service is used for the process, other  scheduling programs could also have this capability, as long as the specifications are met.

The Missed Approach – Hey Where’s the Runway?1Missed Approach SegmentA Missed approach is a procedure used when an instrument approach cannot be completed to a full-stop landing The Missed Approach Segment is that part of an instrument approach procedure between the missed approach point (MAP), the missed approach way-point (MAWP), or the point of arrival at the decision height and the specified missed approach NAVAID (navigational aid), intersection, fix, or waypoint, as appropriate, at the minimum IFR altitude It is in this part of the approach procedure that the aircraft will climb and return to the en route structure or is positioned for holding or subsequent approach The missed approach route and altitudes are shown on the instrument approach charts2The Missed ApproachThe missed approach is one of the most difficult and critical phases of an instrument approach and is the one practiced the least High workload, as the configuration of the aircraft must be changed (approach to climb out), coupled with new navigation route/Navaids An approach in actual conditions should be flown with the anticipation that the missed approach is an anticipated outcome The missed approach procedure typically includes an initial heading or track to follow, and an altitude to climb to.  This is typically followed by holding instructions at a nearby navigation fix Be sure you have reviewed the missed approach procedure BEFORE the FAF3Missed Approach Anatomy4Start of climbObstacle clearance rate of 1 foot vertically for each 40 feet horizontallyHow Did We Get to a Missed Approach FAR 91.175(e)A missed approach procedure must be immediately executed: 1.  Whenever: Flight visibility is less than the specified visibility for the approach If required visual references are not seen at either of the following times:  When the aircraft is being operated below MDA; or Upon arrival at the missed approach point, including a DA/DH where a DA/DH is specified and its use is required, and at any time after that until touchdown. 2.  Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not distinctly visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA, unless the inability to see an identifiable part of the airport results only from a normal bank of the aircraft during the circling approach5Visual References FAR 91.175(c)(3)Except for certain Category II or III approaches, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot to continue below the DH or MDA: The approach light system, except you may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable The threshold The threshold markings The visual approach slope indicator The threshold lights The runway end identifier lights (REIL) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings The touchdown zone lights The runway or runway markings The runway lights Basic rule of thumb you need to distinctly see the runway and/or its lighting 6Also Go Missed If:A safe approach or landing is not possible Full scale needle deflection past the final approach fix Navigation equipment required for the approach fails ATC instructs you to go missed Unsafe runway Traffic Controller or pilot navigation errors Weather – e.g., thunderstorm cell When the aircraft is being operated below MDA – loss of visual references If your gut says something is wrong or unclear7Missed Approach ClearanceA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, absent contrary ATC instructions8Missed Approach ProceduresPublished Missed Approach Instructions If ATC has not issued specific instructions prior to the approach and a missed approach is executed, the pilot must follow the published or default missed approach procedure A controller may issue modified instructions, which supersede the published instructions Verbal Missed Approach Instructions ATC may give you instructions for the missed approach prior to the clearance for the approach ATC will give you altitude, heading, frequency, and supplementary information as required ATC: \"Missed approach instructions, climb [Altitude], turn left [Heading] and contact departure [Frequency]. Be advised [Traffic...]“ If executing instructions different from those on the procedure as dictated by approach, call “on the go\" or \"executing climb out\" to reduce confusion 9Missed Approach Chart SymbolsTo provide ready missed approach guidance, approach plates use quick reference icons Due to limited space only four or less icons can be shown. Hence the icons may not show the entire missed approach procedure The full missed approach instructions are provided textually at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing10JEPP Missed Approach Chart Symbols11NACO Missed Approach Chart Symbols12Climb to altitudeTurn to specified headingTo Specified fixTrack RadialMissed Approach Point LocationThe missed approach point (MAP) on a non-precision approach is\\u2009not designed with any consideration to where the\\u2009aircraft must begin descent to execute a safe landing It is developed based on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and possibly air traffic considerations Descent below the MDA, including during the missed approach, is not authorized The Decision Altitude (DA) is an altitude derived location where a missed approach will be initiated on a precision approach Obstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach Decision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). 13Obstacle Protection Obstacle protection is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the DA/H or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA) A climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart When higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix Preplan your approach to ensure you can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile)  Higher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute) Tables for climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are on page D1 of U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets Formula: Required Climb Per Minute = ((_[climb gradient]_ ft/nautical mile) x ([ground speed] nautical miles/hour)/60) = 36,000 feet per hour = 14Beginning the Procedure Other Than at the MAP/DHIn the design of the missed approach procedure no consideration is given to an abnormally early missed approach turn from the approach course When an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC,  Fly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point  Remain at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver Can begin climb early, absent altitude restrictions Think CFIT when making an early missed!!15Circling Approach MAPExecuting the missed approach after starting the circling maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP The missed approach is executed for the runway the approach started on, not the runway you were circling to The initial turn on a missed approach will always be towards the landing runway until established on a segment of the missed approach Always think about how to execute the missed approach while circling so it is not a surprise if you enter IMC as aircraft is clear of obstacles only when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area16Since the circling missed approach maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost.Flying the Missed ApproachBefore the FAF  Memorize initial altitudes and headings Set up No. 2 Nav if possible for missed approach initial navaid course17Flying the Missed Approach Initial Missed Approach Segment ProcedureAt the MAP / DA Add climb power Rotate gradually (on-speed) to Vx Check for positive rate of climb Clean up the aircraft – gear and flaps up in the order specified by the POH Climb out at appropriate speed18CommunicateUpon execution of a missed approach and becoming stabilized in climb notify ATC If communicating with the Tower - \"[Place] tower, [Callsign], missed approach [Reason]\" If communicating with approach - \"[Place] approach, [Callsign] missed approach off of [Location] climbing through [Altitude] for [Altitude] with request\"19Lost Communications Missed ApproachIf communications are lost during the approach and you take a missed approach: Squawk 7600 Follow the published missed approach instructions to ensure adequate obstruction clearance Route: Proceed to the alternate IAF as filed and commence an approach Altitude: The EXPECTED altitude, if given one, after filing a “DRAFT” or; Your option of the highest of the two emergency safe altitudes depicted on the destination and alternate approach procedure charts if fields are within 200 NM of each other or At flight level 18,000\\' If destination altimeter is 29.92 inches or higher, fly FL180 If destination altimeter is less than 29.92, fly FL190 \"DRAFT\": Short flight plan including - a) Destination; b) Route; c) Altitude; d) Fuel State and e) Time En-route20NOW WHATDecide what your course of action will be Repeat the same approach at the same airport Another approach at the same airport Divert to planned alternate Divert elsewhere Hold for conditions to improve Consider fuel load and distance / time to a good alternate Inform ATC of your desires21Alternate Missed ApproachSome locations may have a preplanned alternate missed approach procedure for use in the event the primary NAVAID used for the missed approach procedure is out of service To avoid confusion, the alternate missed approach instructions are not published on the chart However, the alternate missed approach holding pattern will be depicted on the instrument approach chart  When the alternate missed approach procedure is implemented by NOTAM, it becomes a mandatory part of the procedure. The NOTAM will specify both the textual instructions and any additional equipment requirements necessary to complete the procedure You may reject an ATC clearance for an alternate missed approach that requires equipment not necessary for the published approach procedure when the alternate missed approach is issued after beginning the approach However, if the alternate missed approach is issued prior to beginning the approach the pilot must either accept the entire procedure (including the alternate missed approach) or request a different approach procedure22G1000 Missed ApproachAt the MAP, “SUSP” is displayed in the HSI and directly above the SUSP softkey Automatic sequencing of approach waypoints is suspended at the MAP A “FROM” indication is displayed on the CDI, but the course guidance is simply an extension of the final approach course  Do NOT follow this extended course When the message “RAIM is not available” is displayed in the Alerts Window on the PFD a missed approach must also be executed23G1000 Missed ApproachFlying the Missed Initiate the missed approach sequence by following the missed approach procedures as published / directed by ATC, for proper climb and heading instructions If not already using GPS as nav source, press the CDI softkey to switch external CDI output to GPS for guidance.  Press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic sequencing of waypoints If there is a missed approach course from a fix to altitude, Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to resume automatic leg sequencing After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD The G1000 will guide to the missed approach holding point and a recommended entry procedures for the holding pattern will be shown24G1000 Missed ApproachNote that the G1000 at the holding point again displays “SUSP” above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern The G1000 provides course guidance only on the inbound side of the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern to re-fly the approach, press the PROC key to “Select Approach” or “Activate Approach” (or use the Direct-To key to select another destination)  25G1000 Missed Approach Example Missed Approach Course From Fix To AltitudeAfter pressing the SUSP softkey, the missed approach sequence is automatically started with the course from fix to altitude leg After pushing SUSP, “NEXT DTK 123” message is displayed in the navigation status bar on the PFD Within a few seconds of pressing the SUSP softkey , “SUSP” is re-displayed above the SUSP softkey -  The G1000 returns to suspend mode when flying a course from a fix to altitude leg and indicates that automatic leg sequencing is suspended Fly the outbound course keeping the CDI needle centered. The Navigation Map Page depicts the flight path extending indefinitely from the Navfix. The distance increases and indicates the distance back to the Navaid Upon reaching the desired altitude, press the SUSP softkey to return to automatic leg sequencing. Confirm that ‘SUSP’ no longer is displayed directly above the SUSP softkey The message “NEXT DTK 123” is the displayed, providing guidance to the holding fix. The actual desired track (DTK) depends on the ground speed and distance from the Navaid. Intercept and fly the inbound course, keeping the CDI needle centered As the plane approaches the Navaid (the missed approach holding point), a message in the navigation status bar recommends the holding pattern entry, e.g., “HOLD PARALLEL” Note that the G1000 again displays ‘SUSP’ above the SUSP softkey.  Automatic waypoint sequencing is suspended at the missed approach holding point. The waypoint message (ARRIVING AT WAYPOINT) is displayed each time the plane approaches the holding fix in the holding pattern When leaving the holding pattern, press the PROC key to reactivate the approach or select a different approach, or press the Direct-To key to select another destination26G1000 Missed Approach Additional AutomationGA Switch (Go-Around)  Disengages the autopilot Selects the flight director Go-Around Mode, and  Activates the missed approach The GA Switch is located on the instrument panel above the throttle TOGA (Takeoff/Go-Around) Switch Offers automated go-arounds At the MAP, press the TOGA button Keeps the AP engaged Commands a climb Sets Autopilot to NAV mode and  Sequences to the missed approach 27Pitch-up IllusionPitch-up illusion is a significant hazard during the transition to climb out On approach the portion of the inner ear that provides sensory information related to acceleration—provides the sensation of stabilized speed, based primarily on the forces of gravity When acceleration and climb occur simultaneously as during the initial segment of a missed approach, two forces come together - gravity and acceleration The brain resolves the two forces (gravity and acceleration) as a single resultant force acting downward and backward. The brain incorrectly resolves the two forces as a single pitch-up movement When that occurs, the pilot feels as though the aircraft is climbing or that the nose is pitching up, when, in fact, it remains in level flight.   The normal reaction, absent visual clues, to the pitch-up illusion is to push forward on the stick with the risk of ground contact in a missed approach28Common ErrorsFailure to have essential knowledge of the information on the approach chart Failure to have initial steps of missed approach committed to memory Failure to identify DH or MAP or other condition requiring a missed approach Incorrect communication procedures  Noncompliance with ATC clearances, the published missed approach or an ATC instruction or failure to notify ATC of inability to comply Failure to accomplish checklist items Faulty basic instrument flying techniques Failure to accomplished a missed approach timely – e.g. motoring on to look for references29PTS Standards Area of Operation VI. C.Executes the missed approach procedure when the required visual references for the intended runway are not distinctly visible and identifiable: Non-Precision Approach – at the MAP Precision Approach - at Decision Altitude 30PTS Standards Area of Operation VI. C.Adequate knowledge of the missed approach procedure elements for standard approaches Initiates the missed approach promptly by applying power, establishing a climb attitude, and reducing drag in accordance with the aircraft manufacturer’s recommendations Reports beginning the missed approach procedure to ATC Complies with the published or alternate missed approach procedure Advises ATC or examiner anytime that the aircraft is unable to comply with a clearance, restriction, or climb gradient Follows the recommended checklist items appropriate to the go-around procedure Requests, if appropriate, ATC clearance to the alternate airport, clearance limit, or as directed by the examiner Maintains the recommended airspeed within ±10 knots; heading, course, or bearing within ±10°; and altitude(s) within ±100 feet during the missed approach procedure. Uses MFD and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position and track to help navigate the missed approach. Demonstrates an appropriate level of single-pilot resource management skills.31Questions32DisclaimerInstrument flight can be dangerous.

It’s European equivalent is ED-12B. A document that addresses the life process of developing embedded software in aircraft systems. It is a commonly accepted standard worldwide for regulating safety in the integration of software in aircraft systems.History of DO-178BSoftware in avionics has been around since the 1970’s By adding software to a system, certification becomes more complex. The RTCA creates DO-178 in 1980, while EUROCEA works on ED-35. The merged result is DO-178 / ED-12: the first common certification criteria for production of avionics software.Evolution of DO-178BIn 1985, revisions and updates were made to produce DO-178A / ED-12A. The documents became a worldwide basis for software certification in the aviation industry. DO-178B / ED-12B started in 1989 and finalized in 1992.DO-178B Document LayoutFigure 1-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”DO-178B Software LevelsDO-178B requires that all system requirements be mapped to one of the five software levels.  Level A - most critical failure level.  Failure at Level A results in catastrophic failure conditions for an aircraft.  Level B - the software at this level contributes to severe-major failure conditions.  Level C - software at this level contributes to major failure conditions.  Level D - software at this level contributes to minor failure conditions.  Level E - the software has no effect toward potential failure conditions.DO-178B Processes and OutputsDO-178B is divided into five main processes: Software Planning Software Development Software Verification Software Configuration Management Software Quality Assurance Each process has a set of expected documented outputs.Software Planning ProcessPurpose is to determine what will be done to produce safe, requirements-based software. Expected outputs: Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC) Software Development Plan Software Verification Plan Software Configuration Management Plan Software Quality Assurance PlanSoftware Development ProcessThe software development process is broken into four sub-processes: Software Requirements Process High-level requirements in relation to function, performance, interface and safety. Software Design Process Low-level requirements used to implement the source code. Software Coding Process Production of source-code from the design process. Integration Process Integration of code into a real-time environment.Software Development Process Continued…The following tangible outputs are the result of the combined four sub-processes: Software requirements data (SRD)  Software design description (SDD)  Source code  Executable object codeSoftware Verification ProcessThe purpose is to identify and report any errors resulting from the development process. The verification process objectives can be met with reviews, walkthroughs, unit testing, integration testing, and more. Proof of objectives is within the execution of the testing procedures. Outputs include: Software Verification Cases and Procedures Software Verification ResultsSoftware Verification Process Continued…Figure 6-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”Software Configuration Management ProcessThe purpose is to establish secure and effective configuration control for all artifacts. The following activities are done within the process: Configuration Identification Change Control Baseline establishment Archiving of the software Outputs include: Software Configuration Index, and Software Life Cycle Environment Configuration Index.Software Configuration Management Process (Continued…)Figure 7-1 Taken from AVISTA’s “DO-178B Presentation”Software Quality Assurance ProcessThe purpose is to provide assurance that the software life cycle process is going to yield quality software. Each process is analyzed to show that each process is producing the expected outputs. Any changes from originally proposed plans are reported, evaluated, and resolved to ensure process integrity.DO-178B Processes: ReviewDO-178B software life-cycle process is divided into five main processes: Software Planning Software Development Software Verification Software Configuration Management Software Quality Assurance The objective-based approach of DO-178B makes it flexible to individual projects.DO-178B CertificationD0-178B very specifically addresses the following which directly affects product development. Certification of a product applies only to it\\'s finished result. Certification includes approval of all systems and subsystems, hardware, software, firmware, development tools, production, and testing of the product. Certification is done on the individual application of the product Coding practices must be certified to ensure things like \"dead code\" are not allowed. Certification requires that \\'full testing\\' of the system and all of it\\'s components (including firmware) be done on the target platform in the target environment. Certification requires code testing at the MCDC level.The Future of DO-178CThe evolution of avionics software has forced a change upon the certification process. DO-178B was written absently in mind of older software tools. Advanced technologies and the growing complexities of newer avionics software needs to be addressed.The Future of DO-178CA committee has formed on behalf of the two major contributors (RTCA and EUROCAE) to produce DO-178C / ED-12C. Work has been started as of March 2005 and looks to be finished and published in December 2008. The document looks to tackle the introduction of new software development techniques among other things. I’m sure we’re all looking forward to it.References and Works CitedAvista Incorporated®, “DO-178B Basic Overview.” 7 July 2004.
